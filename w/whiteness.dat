5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, <b>whiteness</b> is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for <b>whiteness.</b> It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage in the tail, with less <b>whiteness</b> on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical <b>whiteness,</b> most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the <b>whiteness</b> of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
25|$|Bleaching {{improves}} <b>whiteness</b> {{by removing}} natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; {{the degree of}} bleaching necessary {{is determined by the}} required <b>whiteness</b> and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of <b>whiteness</b> and absorbency are essential.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>whiteness</b> has {{particular}} resonance in racially diverse countries with large majority populations of mixed European ancestry: for example, in United States (White American), the United Kingdom (White British), Brazil (White Brazilian), and South Africa (White South African). Various social constructions of <b>whiteness</b> have been significant to national identity, public policy, religion, population statistics, racial segregation, affirmative action, white privilege, eugenics, racial marginalization and racial quotas.|$|E

25|$|By {{allowing}} Mexicans {{to become}} citizens, the Senate, for legal purposes, made them white, since under {{the provisions of}} the Naturalization Act of 1790, only whites could become citizens.

25|$|Because {{both the}} {{pavilion}} and crown are comparatively shallow, step cut stones {{are generally not}} as bright and never as fiery as brilliant cut stones, but rather accentuate a diamond's clarity (as even the slightest flaw would be highly visible), <b>whiteness,</b> and lustre (and therefore good polish).|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The <b>whiteness</b> of the face represent the <b>whiteness</b> and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide {{accounts}} for 70% {{of the total}} production volume of pigments worldwide. It is widely used to provide <b>whiteness</b> and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products, and it is present in almost every sunblock, where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that the Greeks had painted their temples influenced the later {{development of the}} style. The archaeological dig at Aegina and Bassae in 1811–12 by Cockerell, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and Karl Haller von Hallerstein had disinterred painted fragments of masonry daubed with impermanent colours. This revelation was a direct contradiction of Winckelmann's notion of the Greek temple as timeless, fixed, and pure in its <b>whiteness.</b>|$|E

25|$|The European name, {{porcelain}} in English, {{come from}} the old Italian porcellana (cowrie shell) because of its resemblance to the translucent surface of the shell. Porcelain is {{also referred to as}} china or fine china in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China. Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, toughness, <b>whiteness,</b> translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock.|$|E
25|$|Nephila spiders {{vary from}} reddish to greenish yellow in color with {{distinctive}} <b>whiteness</b> on the cephalothorax {{and the beginning}} of the abdomen. Like many species of the superfamily Araneoidea, they have striped legs specialized for weaving (where their tips point inward, rather than outward as is the case with many wandering spiders). Their contrast of dark brown/black and green/yellow allows warning and repelling of potential predators to whom their venom might be of little danger.|$|E
25|$|Teide is {{the main}} symbol of Tenerife and the most emblematic natural {{monument}} of the Canary Islands. An image of Teide appears gushing flames at the centre of Tenerife's coat of arms. Above the volcano appears St. Michael, {{the patron saint of}} Tenerife. The flag colors of the island are dark blue, traditionally identified with the sea that surrounds the island, and white for the <b>whiteness</b> of the snow-covered peaks of Mount Teide during winter. The logo of the Cabildo de Tenerife (governing body of the island) includes a symbol of Teide in eruption.|$|E
25|$|This {{account is}} {{consistent}} with teleological explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the <b>whiteness</b> of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence {{in terms of a}} prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past evolutionary history of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{categories}} in Latin America are often linked to both continental ancestry or mixture as inferred from phenotypical traits, {{but also to}} socio-economic status. Ethnicity is often constructed either as an amalgam national identity or as something reserved for the indigenous groups so that ethnic identity is something that members of indigenous groups have {{in addition to their}} national identity. Racial and ethnic discrimination is common in Latin America where socio-economic status generally correlates with perceived <b>whiteness,</b> and indigenous status and perceived African ancestry is generally correlated with poverty and lack of opportunity and social status.|$|E
25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to <b>whiteness.</b> A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E
25|$|The marbles {{generally}} {{were very}} dirty...from a deposit {{of dust and}} soot....I found {{the body of the}} marble beneath the surface white....The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt....The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt...but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed....The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and <b>whiteness</b> which they originally possessed.|$|E
25|$|Ivory, both {{then and}} now, connotes royal wealth, power, and purity. Ivory, already a luxury {{commodity}} in Africa, became increasingly coveted {{with the growth}} of the European ivory trade. When an elephant was killed in Benin, the Oba received one tusk as a gift and was offered the other in sale. Thus, the Oba had many tusks and controlled the ivory trade. Ivory is associated with the Edo orisha of the sea, Olokun. As this orisha gives wealth and fertility, it the spirit world's equivalent of the Benin Oba. Ivory gave wealth similar to Olokun, as it enticed the Portuguese merchants who, in turn, returned wealth to Benin. The Portuguese belonged to Olokun, having arrived from the sea. The <b>whiteness</b> of ivory also reflects the symbolism of white chalk, whose ritual purity is associated with Olokun.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the <b>whiteness</b> property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year King John III of Portugal ordered a search to be instituted for {{the tomb of}} the Apostle St. Thomas. As long as the tomb, with the counterpart of the Ortona relics, was looked for, nothing was found; however when the search was given up, both were accidentally discovered. The royal commission found traces of the old Nestorian chapel, but nothing of the tomb. But while directing operations to build an oratory commemorative of the spot, and digging deeply in the sandy soil to lay its foundations, it found in 1522 a masonry tomb, containing what might have been expected {{to be found in the}} Apostle's tomb: some bones of snowy <b>whiteness,</b> the head of a lance, a pilgrim's staff and an earthen vase. The find brought ruined Betumah into popularity with the Portuguese, who settled here in large numbers and called the new European town São Tomé (after St. Thomas) and São Tomé de Meliapor, when they wanted to distinguish it from São Tomé the West African island, though the town was somewhat distant from Mylapur.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of <b>whiteness.</b> Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E
25|$|Oresme's most {{important}} contributions to mathematics {{are contained in}} Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as {{the length of the}} heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular co-ordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, <b>whiteness,</b> and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.|$|E
25|$|The federal Naturalization Act, {{signed into}} law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated that {{immigrants}} to the United States had to be White according to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of <b>Whiteness</b> differed greatly from White Society's informal definition, thus Jews, Gypsies, Middle Eastern Peoples {{and those of the}} Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Gypsies, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held European Citizenship. The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Mediterranean and Slavic Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56–191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn't until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951. Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law, but this classification did not prevent informal discrimination against them by Anglo-Americans.|$|E
500|$|Germanic [...] is {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} cognate with the Latin albus ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ailbhín ('flock'); Albanian elb ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic álpt. These all come from an Indo-European base *albh-, and seem to be connected {{by the idea of}} <b>whiteness.</b> The Germanic word presumably originally meant [...] "white person", perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought that <b>whiteness</b> implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar, suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts <b>whiteness</b> is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called [...] "the white people" [...] because they were regarded as beautiful.|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, choses {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, choses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for <b>whiteness</b> because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards <b>whiteness.</b> Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for <b>whiteness</b> and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve <b>whiteness</b> to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E

500|$|David Greven, in {{his book}} Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek, said that the Aenar were {{an example of the}} [...] "uncanny whiteness" [...] style {{characters}} which appear in the franchise which are used to provide a [...] "denatured form of whiteness" [...] to the viewer. Other examples of these type of characters include the Borg and the human-like Klingons explained later in season four of Enterprise. He added that the blindness of the Aenar acted as an allegory for the way in which white people are unable to perceive their own <b>whiteness.</b>|$|E

The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove, but the dog warns him he would melt.|$|E
500|$|One {{thread of}} {{critical}} analysis of this tale focuses on the possibly racist implications of Poe's plot and imagery. One such plot element is the black cook who leads the mutiny on the Grampus and is its most bloodthirsty participant. Dirk Peters, a hybrid of white and Native American ancestry, is described as having a ferocious appearance, with long, protruding teeth, bowed legs, and a bald head like [...] "the head of most negroes." [...] The brilliant <b>whiteness</b> of the final figure in the novel contrasts with the dark-skinned savages and such a contrast may call to mind the escalating racial tensions over the question of slavery in the United States as Poe was writing the novel.|$|E
500|$|As {{leader of}} the Klan, Evans {{advanced}} a form of nativist, white supremacy that cast Protestantism as a fundamental part of American patriotism. To Evans, <b>whiteness</b> and Protestantism were equally valued, and sometimes conflated: he said the Klan supported the [...] "uncontaminated growth of Anglo-Saxon civilization". He maintained that white Protestants had the exclusive right to govern the U.S. because of their descent from early colonists, whom he described as fleeing Europe for the U.S. to escape its societal bounds. He admitted that many Klan members were of rural, uneducated backgrounds but argued that power {{should be given to}} [...] "the common people of America".
