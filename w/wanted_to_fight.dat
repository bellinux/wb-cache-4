St. Pierre asked each member to pick the fighter they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> Johnson and Alex Caceres picked each other and a fight was scheduled. Johnson won by {{unanimous}} decision after two rounds, earning himself {{a spot in the}} semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, {{as well as}} thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E

5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted {{on the use of the}} feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, Alexander {{addressed}} the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding {{it had turned}} against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and {{they were prepared to}} offer honorable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied. On 4 April, led by Ney, they confronted Napoleon. Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, and Ney replied the army would follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> on, without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne. Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{completed}} its preparations for full-scale offensive action by expanding its bridgehead at Gyékényes. The cavalry units continued {{to fight the}} Germans around Peteranec, but the left sector of the divisional front line began to disintegrate. The commander of the right sector, Pukovnik Mihailo Georgijević ordered his troops to hold their positions and went to divisional headquarters to ask approval to discharge the Croats in his units. Marić would not inform 4th Army headquarters of this idea, so Georgijević went to Zagreb to speak to Petrović, and to further urge him to withdraw all troops that still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> to a line south of the Sava. According to Georgijević, Petrović ordered him to tell Marić to consider disarming his Croat troops, and to continue to hold positions on {{the line of the}} Bilogora, but to conduct a fighting withdrawal towards Zagreb and Sisak if the German pressure was too great. The intent of these orders was not implemented, as fifth column elements changed the wording so that orders were issued to discharge Croat troops and to retreat towards Zagreb without fighting.|$|E

This change was partly due to the decision of a key Croatian Peasant Party member, Božidar Magovac, to join the Partisans in June 1943, and partly due to the capitulation of Italy.|$|E

Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change would make it easier for Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the mujahideen}} funnelled arms and {{money into the}} country which Bosnia direly needed due to a United Nations-sanctioned arms embargo restricting the import of weapons into all of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, many of the mujahideen were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between the mujahideen and the Bosnians. Furthermore, some mujahideen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> a war of extermination, or use Bosnian territory {{as a base for}} terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|By 1870, the Democratic–Conservative {{leadership}} {{across the}} South decided {{it had to}} end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive {{and move on to}} new issues. The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence. Democrats in the North concurred with these Southern Democrats. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The New Departure offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re-fight the Civil War every election. Furthermore, many wealthy Southern landowners thought they could control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage.|$|E

Here these two brigades were taken over by Major General Richard Guyon (who was not supposed to participate in the battle, because he was designate as the new commander of the besieged troops of Komárom, just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> and help his army to obtain the victory). The two Hungarian brigades under the lead of Guyon forced the Herzinger brigade to retreat.|$|E
