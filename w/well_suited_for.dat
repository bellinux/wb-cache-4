40|$|One common {{method for}} keyword {{spotting}} in unconstrained speech {{is based upon}} a two pass strategy consisting of Viterbi-decoding to detect and segment possible keyword hits, followed by the verification of those hit. In this thesis, we proposed a simple one-pass strategy where computation of the confidence measure is computed simultaneously with a Viterbi like decoding stage for verification purposes. However, backtracking is not required, which when coupled {{with the need for}} only a single pass through the utterance significantly reduces the memory requirements of this algorithm. This feature makes it <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> <b>for</b> devices where processing power and memory are limited. Experimental results on spotting days of the week in continuous speech indicate that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance with two pass strategy...|$|R
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. <b>Well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies.

5|$|The Norman Cob is {{also used}} for riding, and {{may be used for}} most equestrian disciplines. It is {{particularly}} <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> vaulting. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate the breed's calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for mounted hunts. Crosses between the Norman Cob and Thoroughbred continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent Cob blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the Thoroughbred, {{while at the same time}} retaining meat similar in flavor and appearance to that of the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|A {{budget was}} {{prepared}} by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue. The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to Fortifikasjon. Main architects were Moe–Levorsen. A research group was created, which had four main tasks: ventilation, energy, fire and safety; the environment; rock mechanism and geology; and laws and regulations. The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally. In preparation for construction, drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing. The rock is 800 to 1,100 million year-old gneiss which is <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> creating caverns. Computer models were created, and estimates {{were based on the}} Q-method.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 1942, Heydrich {{planned to}} meet Hitler in Berlin. German {{documents}} suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German-occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground.

The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Instead of ordering his driver to speed away, Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers. Kubiš then threw a bomb (a converted anti-tank mine) {{at the rear of}} the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš.|$|E
5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> the industry.|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are intended to}} have large number of sensor nodes which are widely deployed in a distributed environment. Steep increase in number of nodes, which is a deviant to WSN eventually, affects the communication capability of the network as it raises the scalability issue. This at any instance may destabilize network throughput which leads to network failure. Therefore, fault-tolerant protocol is desperately needed to stabilize the dexterity of network. In this paper, we have examined the two prominent routing protocols DSDV and AODV {{which has been the}} inception for evolution of numerous routing protocols for wireless network environments. We have summarized the execution evaluation of the significant parameters (i. e.) throughput, packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay by varying the transmission range for different node densities to analyze which mechanism <b>well</b> <b>suits</b> <b>for</b> the trustworthy WSN environment...|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{popularity}} of the hydrotherapy had declined to the extent that many hotels were already being converted into private boarding schools and rest homes, and education became the basis of Malvern's economy. By 1865, the town already had 17single-gender private schools, increasing to 25 by 1885. The area was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> schools due to its established attractive environment and access by rail. Children could travel unaccompanied with their trunks by rail to their boarding schools near the stations in Great Malvern, Malvern Wells, and Malvern Link. Malvern St James (formerly Malvern Girls College), located in a former hotel directly opposite Great Malvern railway station, has a dedicated (now derelict) tunnel to the basement of the building, which is clearly visible from both platforms of the station.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton.
