40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and transitional waters (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or benthic invertebrates (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and phytobenthos (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other <b>water</b> <b>categories</b> abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and <b>water</b> <b>categories.</b> The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of <b>water</b> <b>categories</b> the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > transitional waters > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classificationJRC.

40|$|In 1990 - 93, tritium {{concentrations}} in water from 19 springs {{along the north}} side of the Snake River near Twin Falls and Hagerman ranged from 9. 2 {+-} 0. 6 to 78. 4 {+-} 5. 1 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The springs were placed into three categories on the basis of their locations and tritium concentrations: Category I springs are the farthest upstream and contained from 52. 8 {+-} 3. 2 to 78. 4 {+-} 5. 1 pCi/L of tritium; Category It springs are downstream from those in Category I and contained from 9. 2 {+-} 0. 6 to 18. 5 {+-} 1. 2 pCi/L; and Category III springs are the farthest downstream and contained from 28. 3 {+-} 1. 9 to 47. 7 {+-} 3. 2 pCi/L. Tritium {{concentrations in}} precipitation and in the Snake River were relatively large in the 1950 `s and 1960 `s owing to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Conversely, tritium concentrations in ground water with a residence time of several tens to a few hundred years, as occurs in the Snake River Plain aquifer hydraulically upgradient from the Category II springs, are comparatively small because of the 12. 4 -year half-life of tritium. The conclusion that recharge from excess applied-irrigation water from the Snake River has affected tritium in the Snake River Plain aquifer is supported by differences in the deuterium (2 H) and oxygen- 18 (180) ratios of water. These ratios indicate that water discharged by the springs is recharged by waters of different origins. Irrigation recharge is more enriched in 2 H and 180 than the regional ground <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> from <b>Category</b> I springs is more enriched in 2 H and 180 than is <b>water</b> from <b>Category</b> II or III springs because a large proportion of irrigation recharge mixes with the regional ground <b>water</b> in <b>Category</b> I springs.

Second, we analyzed the cloud changes due to global warming in simulations using NICAM with the new version of NDW 6 and compared the results to those of other microphysics schemes. Third, we analyzed changes in circulation due to global warming, particularly features as cloud system organization, storm tracks, and TCs.|$|R
