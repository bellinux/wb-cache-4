However, her very popularity created issues with the Kwantung Army, because her utility as an intelligence asset <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> and her value as a propaganda symbol was compromised by her increasingly critical tone against the Japanese military's exploitative policies in Manchukuo as a base of operations against China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, and she gradually faded from public sight.|$|E

This time, it wore a rakishly slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose {{designed}} for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later {{to show up}} on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered opera windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof.

25|$|During filming, it was {{considered}} that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test {{and see what it}} would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did not live up to the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.|$|E
25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> along with most of the hair on top of his head. In the brief film clip, he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson.

500|$|The Polish Army {{was made}} up {{primarily}} of volunteers and organised {{along the lines of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's army, which meant that there was no corporal punishment in the military handbooks and the soldiers were highly motivated. The good morale of the first months of the uprising <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> by the early days of September. A long string of defeats, partial victories, and retreats coupled with high command's indecisiveness and frequent changes in command structure (between 12 and 20 August the post of Commander-in-Chief changed hands four times) meant that the soldiers' morale was low. Also, most of the generals in Warsaw lacked faith in the aims of the uprising set by the more liberal-minded members of Sejm and instead were [...] "only doing their job", hoping the status quo would return as soon as the tsar was forced to stand by his promises. The generals supporting continued fighting (Jan Nepomucen Umiński, Henryk Dembiński, Józef Bem, and Kazimierz Małachowski) were in charge in early September, but they were outnumbered by generals who were willing to sign an armistice with the Russians, even against the will of the Sejm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{so-called}} Watchful Peace {{began in}} 2063 T.A., when Gandalf went to Dol Guldur and the evil dwelling there (later {{known to be}} Sauron) fled east. [...] It lasted until 2460 T.A., when Sauron returned with new strength. During this period Gondor strengthened its borders, keeping a watchful eye on the east, as Minas Morgul was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied with Orcs. But no major escalations occurred except for minor skirmishes with Umbar. In the north, Arnor <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone,</b> but the Hobbits of the Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain, and colonizing Buckland. The Dwarves of Durin's folk under Thorin I abandoned Erebor, and left for the Grey Mountains, where most of their kin now gathered.

6000|$|I {{only saw}} Foss once, though, {{strange as it}} may sound, I have twice talked with him. He lives out of Calistoga, at a ranche called Fossville. One evening, after he <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> home, I dropped into Cheeseborough's, and was asked if I should like to speak with Mr. Foss. Supposing that the {{interview}} was impossible, and that I was merely called upon to subscribe the general sentiment, I boldly answered [...] "Yes." [...] Next moment, I had one instrument at my ear, another at my mouth and found myself, with {{nothing in the world}} to say, conversing with a man several miles off among desolate hills. Foss rapidly and somewhat plaintively brought the conversation to an end; and he returned to his night's grog at Fossville, while I strolled forth again on Calistoga high street. But it was an odd thing that here, on what we are accustomed to consider the very skirts of civilization, I should have used the telephone {{for the first time in}} my civilized career.

60|$|While these {{thoughts}} were passing through his mind, he was feeling, half mechanically, for his purse. Suddenly his heart stopped beating; {{a feeling of}} cold scales passed {{up the back of}} his legs, and a cold blow seemed to fall upon his scalp. He stood petrified for a moment; then he felt again with one feverish movement; and then his loss burst upon him, and he was covered at once with perspiration. To spendthrifts money is so living and actual - it is such a thin veil between them and their pleasures! There is only one limit to their fortune - that of time; and a spendthrift with only a few crowns is the Emperor of Rome until they are spent. For such a person to lose his money is to suffer the most shocking reverse, and fall from heaven to hell, from all to nothing, in a breath. And all the more if he has put his head in the halter for it; if he may be hanged to-morrow for that same purse, so dearly earned, so foolishly departed! Villon stood and cursed; he threw the two whites into the street; he shook his fist at heaven; he stamped, and was not horrified to find himself trampling the poor corpse. Then he began rapidly to retrace his steps towards the house beside the cemetery. He had forgotten all fear of the patrol, which <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> by at any rate, and had no idea but that of his lost purse. It was in vain that he looked right and left upon the snow: nothing was to be seen. He had not dropped it in the streets. Had it fallen in the house? He would have liked dearly to go in and see; but the idea of the grisly occupant unmanned him. And he saw besides, as he drew near, that their efforts to put out the fire had been unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had broken into a blaze, and a changeful light played in the chinks of door and window, and revived his terror for the authorities and Paris gibbet.|$|E

60|$|Yet I must needs {{try to fix}} {{here the}} remembrance {{of two or three}} palaces, of which our fancy took the fondest hold, and to which it yet most fondly clings. It cannot locate them all, and least of all can it place that vast old palace, somewhere near Cannaregio, which faced upon a campo, with lofty windows blinded by rough boards, and empty from top to bottom. It was of the later Renaissance in style, and we {{imagined}} it built in the Republic's declining years by some ruinous noble, whose extravagance forbade his posterity to live in it, for it had that peculiarly forlorn air which belongs to a thing decayed without being worn out. We entered its coolness and dampness, and wandered up the wide marble staircase, past the vacant niches of departed statuary, and came on the third floor to a grand portal which was closed against us by a barrier of lumber. But this could not hinder us from looking within, and we were aware that we stood upon the threshold of our ruinous noble's great banqueting-hall, where he used to give his magnificent feste da ballo. Lustrissimo <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> with all his guests; but there in the roof were the amazing frescos of Tiepolo's school, which had smiled down on them, as now they smiled on us, great piles of architecture, airy tops of palaces, swimming in summer sky, and wantoned over by a joyous populace of divinities of the lovelier sex that had nothing but their loveliness to clothe them and keep them afloat; the whole grandiose and superb beyond the effect of words, and luminous with delicious color. How it all rioted there with its inextinguishable beauty in the solitude and silence, from day to day, from year to year, while men died, and systems passed, and nothing remained unchanged but the instincts of youth and love that inspired it! It was music and wine and wit; it was so warm and glowing that it made the sunlight cold; and it seemed ever after a secret of gladness and beauty that the sad old palace was keeping in its heart against the time to which Venice looks forward when her splendor and opulence shall be indestructibly renewed.|$|E
6000|$|Still glorious outwardly, {{like the}} Roman empire itself, was that great city of Treves; but {{inwardly}} {{it was full}} of rottenness and weakness. The Roman empire had been, in spite of all its crimes, for four hundred years the salt of the earth: but now the salt had lost its savour; and in one generation more it would be trodden under foot and cast upon the dunghill, and another empire would take its place,--the empire, not of brute strength and self-indulgence, but of sympathy and self-denial,--an empire, not of Caesars, but of hermits. Already was Gratian the friend and pupil of St. Ambrose of Milan; already, too, was he persecuting, though not to the death, heretics and heathens. Nay, some fifty years before (if the legend can be in the least trusted) had St. Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, returned from Palestine, bearing with her--so men believed--not only the miraculously discovered cross of Christ, but the seamless coat which he had worn; and, turning her palace into a church, deposited the holy coat therein: where--so some believe--it remains until this day. Men felt that a change was coming, but whence it would come, or how terrible it would be, they could not tell. It was to be, as the prophet says, [...] "like the bulging out of a great wall, which bursteth suddenly in an instant." [...] In the very amphitheatre where Gratian sat that afternoon, with all the folk of Treves about him, watching, it may be, lions and antelopes from Africa slaughtered--it may be criminals tortured to death--another and an uglier sight had been twice seen some seventy years before. Constantine, so-called the Great, had there exhibited his [...] "Frankish sports," [...] the [...] "magnificent spectacle," [...] the [...] "famous punishments," [...] as his flattering court-historians called them: thousands of Frank prisoners, many of them of noble, and even of royal blood, torn to pieces by wild beasts, while they stood fearless, smiling with folded arms; and when the wild beasts were gorged, and slew no more, weapons were put {{into the hands of the}} survivors, and they were bidden to fight to the death for the amusement of their Roman lords. But fight they would not against their own flesh and blood: and as for life, all chance of that <b>was</b> <b>long</b> <b>gone</b> by. So every man fell joyfully upon his brother's sword, and, dying like a German man, spoilt the sport of the good folk of Treves. And it seemed for a while as if there were no God in heaven who cared to avenge such deeds of blood. For the kinsmen, it may be the very sons, of those Franks were now in Gratian's pay; and the Frank Merobaudes was his [...] "Count of the Domestics," [...] and one of his most successful and trusted generals; and all seemed to go well, and brute force and craft to triumph on the earth.|$|E
