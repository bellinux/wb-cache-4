The weak part of the welding seam is found, and then the welding deformation of the boom is analyzed for the weak welding part. Further, the deformation trends of the <b>welding</b> <b>arm</b> are studied. It is found that the weak part of the welding seam is at the welding arc of the boom plate and the beam. Besides, the deformation of the arm plate is about 30 mm inward in the welding process due to the welding stress, and the residual stress of the boom. This work can provide theoretical and data support for the processing and deformation correction of the boom...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{signal mast}} arm {{baseplate}} connections are particularly susceptible to fatigue. The top of traffic signal mast <b>arm</b> <b>welds</b> experience fluctuating tensile stresses when wind and traffic gust loads cause the mast arm to oscillate. It has been postulated that UIT application to mast <b>arm</b> <b>weld</b> toes during the fabrication process will delay fatigue crack initiation. Successful UIT application during the fabrication process will extend fatigue lives of traffic signal mast <b>arm</b> <b>welds</b> in the field. Since mast <b>arm</b> <b>welds</b> are the weakest {{spot in the}} traffic signal structure, increased weld life translates into increased traffic signal life. Previous research claims that UIT is light, quiet, and easy to learn. Critical areas under scrutiny during UIT application at the fabrication plant are: time lost due to training workers, time lost during the UIT application, and efficiency of the treated poles. This report investigates the first two issues by documenting the application of UIT to fabricated mast arms at the TransAmerican Power Products facility...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{presents}} a benchmarking analysis that investigates the efficiency gap {{in relation to}} spot welding robots in automotive body shops at foreign and domestic companies in North America. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine body shop efficiency improvement opportunities for the domestic companies or the Big Three, therefore reducing the competitive gap and improving business performance. Design/methodology/approach – The following paper is an extension of an earlier dissertation study conducted by EL-Khalil that focused on improving body shop overall efficiency. The Harbour Report was utilized to determine the best in class facilities that must be visited for benchmarking purposes. The data and information presented were obtained from the facilities visited through observations and interviews. The research utilized the corresponding facilities' labs in order to perform measurements and inspect product welding efficiency. The data obtained were a result of a two-year benchmarking study. Findings – The inspection results of spot welds applied on the door flange do not justify the utilization of additional spot <b>welding</b> <b>arm</b> designs and/or robots for the domestic companies. The data presented provide a good opportunity for improving business performance at the body shop Big Three facilities. In order to reduce the current competitive gap, decrease cost, and improve utilization, the Big Three must adopt new strategies (i. e. communization of specific vehicles parts). Research limitations/implications – The benchmarking study was limited to the aperture area. Researchers are encouraged to test the propositions further on different types of vehicles and different areas of the vehicle body. Practical implications – Based on the actual findings, this paper {{presents a}} case that impacts the improvements of the body shop overall performance in relation to reducing the number of spot <b>welding</b> <b>arm</b> and robot designs at the automotive industry in North America. Originality/value – The presented gap analysis on body shop spot welding efficiency for automotive companies in North America was not conducted previously. Therefore, the data can be utilized as a benchmark target to drive improvements at the domestic automotive body shops. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{constructing}} {{resistance welding}} machines involves {{a combination of}} electrical design, machine structures, mechanisms and controls. The machines vary from simple mechanisms to exceptionally complicated units. Monitoring the condition of large upset welding machines in operating industries has attracted increasing interest in recent years owing {{to the need for}} decreasing the energy consumption on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures. Upset Welding (UW) is a resistance welding process utilizing both heat and deformation to form a weld. A micro-setup would certainly reduce heat consumption and offer greater efficiency. In this paper an electro-mechanical micro upset welding setup is constructed following the fundamental principles of resistance welding. The chief electrical and mechanical components used are single phase ac transformer, <b>welding</b> <b>arms</b> or copper alloy electrodes, externally threaded steel shaft, frame, multimeter and control switches. After the construction of the micro welder, two thin sheets of mild steel are welded...|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} is an {{inexpensive}} and efficient way ofjoining metals. It has extensive applications in household appliancesand in automotive industries. The traditional approach in relation tospot welding machines {{is to use}} 50 Hz welding transformers. Thedrawback associated with these transformers {{is that they are}} both heavyand bulky. Moreover, the fusing requirements become larger due toincreased welding power. With the development of high power semiconductor switches andDC-DC converter topologies, it is now possible to develop inverterdrive resistance spot welding equipment (RSE) which can be operatedat frequencies higher than the 50 Hz frequency. The advantage of usinghigh frequencies is the reduction {{in the size of the}} transformer. Moreover, the fusing requirements are relaxed, as the power is sharedbetween three phases. In many industrial applications long <b>welding</b> <b>arms</b> are requiredbetween the transformer and the weld spot, which increases theinductance. The parasitic inductance in <b>welding</b> <b>arms</b> limits themaximum rate of change of the current. In order achieve a higher powerthe current has to be rectified. To rectify a current of the order of tenthof kA is challenging task and is one of the major sources of loss. The full bridge converter topology is used for the inverter drive RSE. The power switches used in the converter are IGBT. In RSE, the DClink capacitors are used to store high energy. In the case of circuitfailure, the stored energy can cause the IGBT device to rupture and inorder to avoid this, a protection scheme is discussed in this work. A controller circuit, using a DSPIC 33 FJ 16 GS 502 controller, isdeveloped in order to drive a high frequency full bridge converter,which can also be used to drive the IGBTs in the RSE. The secondary side welding current is of the order of kilo amperes. A requirement for the welding control is that the current must be sensedprecisely and in order to fulfill this, a Hall sensor system has beendeveloped. This developed circuit is used in the feed-back control of theRSE. The presence of metallic objects and tools in the vicinity of theHall sensor system can affect its precision. We have estimated theivexclusion distance for the metal objects from the sensor by means of amodel developed in COMSOL Multiphysics software...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue failure {{characteristics}} of friction stir welds in 13 mm gauge 2024 -T 351 plate have been assessed. Failure occurred {{from either the}} <b>weld</b> region (nugget/flow <b>arm)</b> or from the material immediately surrounding the weld. Fatigue failure from the surrounding material was essentially conventional, initiating from large S-phase intermetallic particles and growing in a macroscopic mode I manner. Corresponding fatigue lives were seen to be comparable to parent plate and results previously reported for similar welds in thinner plate. Failure over the weld region was identified with discontinuities in the macroscopic flow pattern of the <b>weld</b> flow <b>arm.</b> Subsequent crack growth showed pronounced macroscopic crack deflection around the ‘onion ring’ structure of the weld nugget. The bands making up the onion rings were identified with variations in local hardness levels, consistent with a mechanical contribution to the crack deflection process...|$|R

40|$|Spot welding {{guns are}} {{predominantly}} used for welding steel sheets in the automotive industry. High press powers {{are necessary for}} the method of spot <b>welding.</b> Therefore, the <b>arms</b> of the gun must have high stiffnes values to achieve high qualities of welding.

Accuracy and dynamics of the robots can be improved by reducing the weight of the components being moved as i. e. the spot welding gun. The aim of this diploma thesis was to determine, whether there was the possibility of both achieving a reduction of weight and keeping the stiffness values while replacing steel with fibre reinforced composites. The outer geometry of the partially bended arms wasn't allowed to be exceeded. The analysis of the design was firstly done by numerical simulation.
