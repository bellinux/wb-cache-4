Shorey scored Reading's first goal in five matches in the 90th minute for the Royals, but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late—Villa had scored two goals earlier on in the match through Ashley Young and Marlon Harewood, condemning Reading to 2–1 defeat.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the uprising, it was {{believed}} by some that agents from Iran moved in amongst the population for the future channeling of Islamic revolution; an unsubstantiated claim which the Ba'athist regime <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> eager to propagate in their attempt to discredit the uprising. Finally, on 1 March, the uprising began in the southern city of Basra. With this, the tides of revolt spread throughout Iraq, from the southern marshes to the Kurdish mountains.|$|E
25|$|Geronimo, camped on the Mexican {{side of the}} border, {{agreed to}} Crook's {{surrender}} terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered {{as soon as they}} crossed the border. Geronimo, Nachite, and 39 of his followers slipped away during the night. Crook exchanged a series of heated telegrams with General Philip Sheridan defending his men's actions, until on April 1, 1886, he sent a telegram asking Sheridan to relieve him of command, which Sheridan <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> willing to do.|$|E

25|$|After this, Dias' career took a {{turn for}} the worse. He only passed 50 in Tests once again – in a drawn Test with India were 1096 runs were scored for the fall of only 17 wickets – and poor form saw him being dropped from the ODI side after the first match in the 1987 cricket World Cup, where he scored 1. He {{returned}} for the last match of the 1987 cricket World Cup, the team having played and lost four matches without him, and while his team-mates failed to pass 40 he recorded 80 in his last international innings. However, the target of 219 <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> small, and Sri Lanka ended up without a single victory in that World Cup.|$|E
25|$|John M. Studebaker {{had always}} viewed the {{automobile}} as complementary to the horse-drawn wagon, {{pointing out that}} the expense of maintaining a car might be beyond the resources of a small farmer. In 1918, when Erskine's history of the firm was published, the annual capacity of the seven Studebaker plants was 100,000 automobiles, 75,000 horse-drawn vehicles, and about $10,000,000 worth of automobile and vehicle spare parts and harness. In the preceding seven years, 466,962 horse-drawn vehicles had been sold, as against 277,035 automobiles, but the trend <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> clear. The regular manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered removal of the last wagon gear in 1919. To its range of cars, Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse-drawn wagons. Buses, fire engines, and even small rail locomotive-kits were produced using the same powerful six-cylinder engines.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz never married. He complained on {{occasion}} about money, but the fair sum {{he left to}} his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> {{often the case with}} professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the calculus controversy. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination. He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. On Leibniz's religious views, though he was a protestant, Leibniz learned to appreciate the good sides of Catholicism through his patrons and colleagues. He never admitted the Protestant view of Pope as an Antichrist. Leibniz was claimed as a philosophical theist.|$|E

25|$|Yashin was {{nominated}} for Ballon d'Or in 1960 and 1961 and placed fifth and fourth, respectively. In 1962, despite suffering two concussions during the tournament, he once again led the team to a quarter-final finish, before losing to host country Chile. That tournament showed that Yashin <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> human, having made some uncharacteristic mistakes. In the game against Colombia, which the Soviet Union was leading 4–1, Yashin let in a few soft goals, including a goal scored by Marcos Coll directly from a corner kick (the first and the only goal scored directly from a corner in FIFA World Cup history). The game finished in a 4–4 tie, which led the French newspaper l'Equipe to predict the end of Yashin’s career. He did, however, make an outstanding save against Chile in the Quarter-Final. Despite this, the Soviet Union suffered a 2–1 defeat and were eliminated from the World Cup.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three {{boundaries}} in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted to block out the overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.|$|E
25|$|England, however, {{continued}} to paste the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan was lucky {{on more than}} one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> embarrassing for Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good as it got for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.|$|E

25|$|The chase of 106 - again {{cut down}} due to rain - {{was led by}} Avishka Gunawardene, who saw off the opening bowlers with {{relative}} ease, taking Rasel for runs while defending more against the experienced Baisya - who dug out two wickets, those of Tharanga and pinch-hitter Lokuhettige. However, {{he did not get}} any further wickets, and Bangladesh were put to the sword by Gunawardene before Rafique and Mahmud calmed him down as he neared fifty. After four overs without boundaries, Gunawardene brought up his fifty with one edged through third man, before pulling a short ball straight to Tushar Imran who held the catch comfortably. Yet, Sri Lanka still needed 22 runs for the victory, with seven wickets in hand and one of their most experienced batsmen in Kumar Sangakkara at the crease. In the 21st over, Sangakkara levelled the scores with two big leg side shots that went for four, before calling a risky single that had Thilan Samaraweera run out for 18. Nevertheless, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late, as Sangakkara wrapped it up by hitting a single to midwicket.|$|E

500|$|In {{the context}} of this debate, music writers have {{interpreted}} Illmatic as an admonishment for hip hop purists and practitioners. In the opening track, [...] "The Genesis", Nas bemoans the lack of legitimacy among other MCs in the projects, insisting that he has [...] "Been doin' this shit since back then." [...] Citing songs such as “Life's a Bitch”, Guthrie Ramsay Jr. argues that Nas “set a benchmark for rappers in an artistic field consumed by constantly shifting notions of 'realness', authenticity, and artistic credibility." [...] Sohail Daulatzai writes: [...] "Though Illmatic was highly anticipated release, far from under the radar, Nas's taking it back to 'the dungeons of rap' was…a kind of exorcism or purging ('where fake niggas don’t make it back') that was at the very least trying to claim a different aesthetic of resistance and rebellion that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> aware of hip-hop's newfound mainstream potential." ...|$|E
