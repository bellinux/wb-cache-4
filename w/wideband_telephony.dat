50|$|Enhanced aptX {{provides}} coding at 4:1 compression {{ratios for}} professional audio broadcast applications and {{is suitable for}} AM, FM, DAB, HD Radio and 5.1. Enhanced aptX can handle up to 4 stereo pairs of AES3 audio and compress to 1 AES3 stream for transmit. Enhanced aptX supports bit-depths of 16-bit, 20-bit or 24-bit. For 16-bit audio sampled at 48 kHz, the bit-rate for E-aptX is 384 kbit/s (2-channel), 767 kbit/s (4-channel), 1024 kbit/s (5.1-channel), and 1.28 Mbit/s (5.1 channels plus stereo). Its lowest bit-rate is 60 kbit/s for 16-bit mono audio sampled at 15 kHz, offering 7.5 kHz frequency response just below that of <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> codecs (which usually operate at 16 kHz sampling rate).|$|E
40|$|In {{anticipation}} of upcoming mobile telephony services with higher speech quality, a wideband (50 Hz to 7 kHz) mobile telephony deriva-tive of TIMIT {{has been recorded}} called WTIMIT. It opens up various scientific investigations; e. g., on speech quality and intelligibility, {{as well as on}} wideband upgrades of network-side interactive voice response (IVR) systems with retrained or bandwidth-extended acoustic models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). <b>Wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> could enable network-side speech recognition applications such as remote dictation or spelling without the need of distributed speech recognition techniques. The WTIMIT corpus was transmitted via two prepared Nokia 6220 mobile phones over T-Mobile’s 3 G wideband mobile network in The Hague, The Netherlands, employing the Adaptive Multirate Wideband (AMR-WB) speech codec. The paper presents observations of transmission effects and phoneme recogni-tion experiments. It turns out {{that in the case of}} <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony,</b> server-side ASR should not be carried out by simply decimating received signals to 8 kHz and applying existent narrowband acoustic models. Nor do we recommend just simulating the AMR-WB codec for training of wideband acoustic models. Instead, real-world <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> channel data (such as WTIMIT) provides the best training material for wideband IVR systems. 1...|$|E

This results in a significant improvement in voice quality since it allows the wideband codec to transmit consonants, sibilants and other subtleties of the human voice formerly lost by narrowband codecs and significantly adds to the intelligibility and quality of the speech signal.|$|R

These techniques {{have been used}} in the variable-rate multimode wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec recently selected by 3 GPP 2 for <b>wideband</b> (WB) speech <b>telephony,</b> streaming, and multimedia messaging services in the cdma 2000 third generation wireless system. The coding algorithm contains several innovations that enable very good performance at average bit rates as low as 4. 0 kbit/s in typical conversational operating conditions. These innovations include: Efficient noise suppression algorithm, signal classification and rate selection algorithm that enables high quality operation at low average bit rates, efficient post-processing techniques tailored for wideband signals, and novel frame erasure concealment techniques including supplementary information for reconstruction of lost onsets and improving decoder convergence. Further, the coder utilizes efficient coding types optimized for different classes of speech signal including a generic coding type based on AMR-WB for transients and onsets, voiced coding type optimized for stable voiced signals and utilizing novel signal modification procedure resulting in good wideband quality at 6. 2 kbit/s, unvoiced coding types optimized for unvoiced segments, and efficient comfort noise generation coding.

40|$|Traditional {{landline}} {{and cellular}} communications use a bandwidth of 300 - 3400 Hz for transmitting speech.

Echo and noise are two challenging issues in <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony,</b> {{due to increased}} perceptual sensitivity by users. Subjective and/or objective measurements of speech quality are important in benchmarking speech processing algorithms and evaluating the effect of parameters like noise, echo, and delay in <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony.</b> Subjective measures include ratings of speech quality by listeners, whereas objective measures compute a metric based on the reference and degraded speech samples.

This thesis reports results from a series of experiments on subjective and objective speech quality evaluation for <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> applications. First, a custom wideband noise reduction database was created that contained speech samples corrupted by different background noises at different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and processed by six different noise reduction algorithms. Comprehensive subjective evaluation of this database revealed an interaction between the algorithm performance, noise type and SNR. Several auditory-based objective metrics such as the Loudness Pattern Distortion (LPD) measure based on the Moore - Glasberg auditory model were evaluated in predicting the subjective scores. In addition, the performance of Bayesian Multivariate Regression Splines(BMLS) was also evaluated in terms of mapping the scores calculated by the objective metrics to the true quality scores. The combination of LPD and BMLS resulted in high correlation with the subjective scores and was used as a substitution for fine - tuning the noise reduction algorithms. Second, the effect of echo and delay on the wideband speech was evaluated in both listening and conversational context, through both subjective and objective measures. A database containing speech samples corrupted by echo with different delay and frequency response characteristics was created, and was later used to collect subjective quality ratings. The LPD - BMLS objective metric was then validated using the subjective scores. Third, to evaluate the effect of echo and delay in conversational context, a realtime simulator was developed. Pairs of subjects conversed over the simulated system and rated the quality of their conversations which were degraded by different amount of echo and delay. The quality scores were analysed and LPD+BMLS combination was found to be effective in predicting subjective impressions of quality for condition-averaged data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{wideband}} CELP coder using frequency warping. Instead of linear prediction, the proposed coder adopts the melgeneralized cepstral analysis, and encodes fullband {{of the speech}} signal through a warped frequency scale. It is shown that the subjective quality of the proposed coder at 16 kbit/s is better {{than that of the}} ITU-T G. 722 at 64 kbit/s. Furthermore, the proposed coder gives a much smaller difference in performance for male and female speakers than the conventional CELP coder. These results indicate that the frequency warping makes a large contribution to the improvement of the subjective quality for wideband speech coding. 1. INTRODUCTION Wideband speech signals, which have a bandwidth of 50 - 7000 Hz, are more natural and intelligible than narrow-band speech signals with 300 to 3400 Hz bandwidth. Several applications such as teleconferencing, multimedia services and high-quality <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> often require compression of wideband speech. In wideband spee [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{migration}} of telecommunication towards wideband transmission may also introduce {{new types of}} degradations. This paper focuses {{on the influence of}} echoes. The different frequency content of un-cancelled residual echoes in wideband transmission, especially the signal energy in higher frequency ranges above 3 kHz, significantly changes the echo perception and echo disturbance compared to the narrowband case. The results of subjective tests presented in this paper point out that the spectral content of residual echoes may influence the quality rating by more than 2 MOS on a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) scale. Especially the frequency range between approximately 3 and 6 kHz needs to be addressed in wideband communication in order to avoid echo disturbances. The results presented here motivate new tolerance schemes for the echo analysis which differ from commonly used methods, as e. g. given in standards like ETSI 202 739 or TIA 920 for <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony.</b> Index Terms — Wideband transmission, echo perception, echo attenuation, subjective testin...|$|E
30|$|Scalability {{has become}} an {{important}} issue in multimedia streaming over packet networks such as the Internet [9]. Several scalable coding algorithms have been proposed in literature. The embedded version of the G. 726 (ITU-T G. 727 ADPCM) [10], the MPEG- 4 Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) algorithm, and the MPEG- 4 Harmonic Vector Excitation Coding (HVXC) {{are some of the}} standardized scalable coders [5]. The recently standardized ITU-T G. 729.1 [11], an 8 – 32 [*]kbps scalable speech coder for <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony</b> and voice over IP (VoIP) applications, is scalable in bit rate, bandwidth and computational complexity. Its bitstream comprises 12 embedded layers with a core layer interoperable with ITU-T G. 729 [12]. The G. 729.1 output bandwidth is 50 – 4000 [*]Hz at 8 and 12 [*]kbit/s and 50 – 7000 [*]Hz from 14 to 32 [*]kbit/s (per 2 [*]kbit/s steps). A Scalable Phonetic Vocoder (SPV), capable of operating at rates 300 – 1100 [*]bps, is introduced in [13]. The proposed SPV uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based phonetic speech recognizer to estimate the parameters for a Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction (MELP) speech synthesizer [14]. Subsequently, it employs a scalable system to quantize the error signal between the original and phonetically-estimated MELP parameters.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} VoIP {{communication}} relies significantly {{on the network}} that transports the voice packets because this network does not usually guarantee the available bandwidth, delay, and loss that are critical for real-time voice traffic. The solution proposed here is to manage the voice-over-IP stream dynamically, changing parameters as needed to assure quality. The main objective of this dissertation is to develop an adaptive speech encoding system {{that can be applied}} to conventional (telephony-grade) and wideband voice communications. This comprehensive study includes the investigation and development of three key components of the system. First, to manage VoIP quality dynamically, a tool is needed to measure real-time changes in quality. The E-model, which exists for narrowband communication, is extended to a single computational technique that measures speech quality for narrowband and wideband VoIP codecs. This part of the dissertation also develops important theoretical work in the area of <b>wideband</b> <b>telephony.</b> The second system component is a variable speech-encoding algorithm. Although VoIP performance is affected by multiple codecs and network-based factors, only three factors can be managed dynamically: voice payload size, speech compression and jitter buffer management. Using an existing adaptive jitter-buffer algorithm, voice packet-size and compression variation are studied as they affect speech quality under different network conditions. This study explains the relationships among multiple parameters as they affect speech transmission and its resulting quality. Then, based on these two components, the third system component is a novel adaptive-rate control algorithm that establishes the interaction between a VoIP sender and receiver, and manages voice quality in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the system provides better average voice quality than traditional VoIP...|$|E
