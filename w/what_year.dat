5|$|The {{foundation}} of Shamrock Rovers is disputed amongst {{supporters of the}} club. No official documentation of the era exists. For many years the earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland came from 1901 and {{an article in the}} club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in this year. Research by the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust uncovered a very brief report in the Evening Herald from April 1899 on a match between Shamrock Rovers and Rosemount, has established that the club was in existence from at least that time. The only two certainties about the origins of the club in relation to <b>what</b> <b>year</b> they were formed are the facts that, Rovers played only exhibition games for {{the first two years of}} their existence and the club registered with the Leinster Football Association in 1901. Essentially, the dispute is over whether the two years of exhibition games were played before or after the registration. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the date 1899 was written on the gates of Glenmalure Park but since the 1990s, 1901 had been adopted as the founding year by the various regimes which have run the club. In light of the discovery of evidence supporting a founding date before April 1899 the club opened a 1899 Suite in Tallaght Stadium in February 2017.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no record}} of Liston's birth. His family's home state of Arkansas did not make birth {{certificates}} mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Sonny Liston, {{can be found in}} the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself may not have known <b>what</b> <b>year</b> he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. He finally settled on a date of birth of May 8, 1932 for official purposes but by the time he won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston's most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.|$|E

The earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland comes from 1899 and {{an article in the}} club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in this year.

25|$|Less {{is known}} {{of the events of}} Statius' life. He was born c. 45 AD. From his boyhood he was victorious in poetic {{contests}} many times at his native Naples and three times at the Alban Festival, where he received the golden crown from the hand of the emperor Domitian who had instituted the contest. For the Alban Festival, Statius composed a poem on the German and Dacian campaigns of Domitian which Juvenal lampoons in his seventh satire. Statius is thought to have moved to Rome c. 90 after his father's death where he published his acclaimed epic poem the Thebaid c. 92. In the capital, Statius seems to have made many connections among the Roman aristocracy and court, and he was probably supported through their patronage. Statius produced the first three books of occasional poetry, his Silvae, which were published in 93, which sketch his patrons and acquaintances of this period and mention his attendance at one of Domitian's Saturnalia banquets. He competed in the great Capitoline competition, although it is not known in <b>what</b> <b>year,</b> although 94 has been suggested. Statius failed to win the coveted prize, a loss he took very hard. The disappointment may have prompted his return to Naples around 94, the home of his youth. In existence is a poem he addressed to his wife, Claudia, the widow of a famous singer who had a musically talented daughter by her first husband, on this occasion (Silv. 3.5).|$|E

[...] Jim Ross said that Chyna had an [...] "overwhelming desire" [...] to be inducted during her lifetime. [...] On February 9, 2015, during a WWE Network podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H mentioned that Chyna deserved to be in the Hall of Fame but that problems with children Googling her prohibited it. The day following her death, a post on WWE.com expressed sadness about it and featured a video of her winning the Women's Championship. In an interview with The Daily Mirror shortly after her death, Triple H said that she [...] "definitely warranted" [...] a place in the Hall of Fame. [...] The following month, Stephanie McMahon said she was sure Chyna would be inducted but was not sure <b>what</b> <b>year</b> it would happen. After a long time without the WWE acknowledging anything about Laurer's career, on the April 25 episode of Raw, WWE played a memory posthumous tribute in her honor.|$|E

500|$|In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a [...] "clothing-optional" [...] {{campground}} in Sherman, New York, {{attended by}} about 400members. The event was ostensibly intended {{to celebrate the}} coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998; this has been interpreted as a satire {{of the way that}} religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of [...] "performance art". Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of Jesus' walk on water. Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about <b>what</b> <b>year</b> the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack casts the productions as carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her <b>what</b> <b>year</b> it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E

2500|$|Unusually Beckett {{sets the}} action in a {{specific}} year, 1924; however, Bertrand appears vague at first as to <b>what</b> <b>year</b> it actually is. “A refers to “Our Lady of [...] Succour whose feast is June 27, the next full moon and the anticipated date of the suicide of C, for whom that succour would be appropriate.” He also makes an interesting off-the-cuff remark {{towards the end of}} the play: “Ah Morvan, you’d be the death of me if I were sufficiently alive!” We can infer from this, and from the fact that they have advance knowledge of a suicide attempt, that these auditors are really some form of cosmic being.|$|E

This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar. However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, [...] "More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively." [...] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, [...] "Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure <b>what</b> <b>year</b> it was. The year of my visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play....
