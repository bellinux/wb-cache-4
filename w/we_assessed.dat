50|$|Methods: A {{cluster sample}} survey was {{undertaken}} throughout Iraq during September 2004. 33 clusters of 30 households each were interviewed about household composition, births, and deaths since January 2002. In those households reporting deaths, the date, cause, and circumstances of violent deaths were recorded. <b>We</b> <b>assessed</b> {{the relative risk}} of death associated with the 2003 invasion and occupation by comparing mortality in the 17.8 months after the invasion with the 14.6-month period preceding it.|$|E
50|$|To further {{delineate}} the {{mechanism by which}} central nesfatin-1 modulates glucose homeostasis, <b>we</b> <b>assessed</b> the effects of central nesfatin-1 on the phosphorylation of several proteins in the INSR → IRS-1 → AMPK → Akt signaling cascade in the liver. We found that central nesfatin-1 significantly augmented InsR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that central nesfatin-1 in both SD and HFD rats resulted in a stimulation of liver insulin signaling that {{could account for the}} increased insulin sensitivity and improving glucose metabolism.|$|E

Five months later, CAMH told Agar “Dr. Simpson is not available for a follow-up interview.” ...|$|E
5000|$|A later {{study of}} 50 {{subtrochanteric}} fractures, which were assessed using the Seinsheimer classification, criticized the classification system for having poor inter-rater reliability. They noted that [...] "Earlier studies of pertrochanteric sic and femoral neck fractures {{show that the}} use of classification systems is often difficult, with low agreement (Frandsen et al. 1988, Andersen et al. 1990, Gehrchen et al. 1993). The results of these studies accord with the low level of interobserver agreement in our study. A total agreement of 26% or at the best 60% is not acceptable." [...] A further study published in 2014 assessed four subtrochanteric fracture classification systems, including the Seinsheimer system, and concluded that [...] "the four subtrochanteric classification systems which <b>we</b> <b>assessed</b> were not found to be sufficiently reproducible to be of any significant value in clinical practice." ...|$|E
