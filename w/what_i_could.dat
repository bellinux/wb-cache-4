According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.|$|E
500|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while still at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed Henry Cow. While at University, Frith read John Cage's , which changed his {{attitude}} to music completely. He realised that [...] "sound, in and of itself, can {{be as important as}} ... melody and harmony and rhythm." [...] This changed his approach to the guitar, [...] "just to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get out of it", and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout Frith's musical career.|$|E

I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do." [...] By his own later description, Gravel had been a womanizer while in the Senate, and in December 1980 {{he and his wife}} Rita separated. They filed for divorce in September 1981; she would later get all of his Senate pension income.|$|E
500|$|In early 1865, {{at the age}} of 13, Edgardo {{became a}} novice in the Canons Regular of the Lateran, adding the Pope's name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote {{repeatedly}} to his family, he recalled, [...] "dealing with religion and doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith," [...] but received no reply until May 1867—his parents, who were now living in Florence, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Italian troops captured the city on 20 September 1870.|$|E

Love is a great motivator, for good and evil." [...] He and fellow executive producer Jeff Pinkner believed the episode was [...] "kind of like a perfect version of what a Fringe show is," [...] because it depicted [...] "fringy" [...] elements {{in the form of}} killings while using love and relationships as central plot drivers. Wyman added that it was a [...] "culmination of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> describe as — it’s a direction where we’ve been heading and I think the fans will be really happy and satisfied." ...|$|E

Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side.

500|$|The rather later satirist Juvenal (born, probably, in the 50s CE) also {{provides}} {{evidence for the}} monkey, he even pities the monkey, at one point, as an innocent sufferer. Not so with how Emperor Nero was reviled. In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough. This might, for example, be a reference both {{to the death of}} Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland. Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said [...] "I have done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> But you deserve the sack!".|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine.

Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do.

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with myself to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I kept my emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E

The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice.

500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the {{occupation}} of Estonia by Nazi Germany, Estonian expectations of regaining their independence began to diminish. Pursuant to the Constitution of Estonia, formally still in force, Estonian politicians formed an underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia which convened on 14 February 1944. As President Konstantin Päts was currently imprisoned by the Soviet authorities, the acting head of state according to the Constitution was the former Prime Minister Jüri Uluots. The German-appointed Estonian Self-Administration had previously attempted several unsuccessful general mobilisation calls, which were illegal under the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) and opposed by Uluots. In February 1944 when the Leningrad Front reached the vicinity of Narva and the Soviet return became a real threat, Uluots switched his stand on the German draft. In a radio speech on 7 February, Uluots reasoned that armed Estonians could become useful against both Germans and Soviets. He also hinted that Estonian troops on Estonian soil would have: [...] "... a significance much wider than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and would be able to disclose here." [...] Along with other Estonian politicians, Uluots saw resistance against the Soviet Armed Forces as a means of preventing the restoration of Soviet power and restoring Estonia’s independence once the war was over. The conscription call was received with popular support and the mobilisation brought together 38,000 men who were formed into seven border guard regiments and the fictitiously named 20th Estonian SS-Volunteer Division, commonly referred to among the German Armed Forces as the Estonian Division. Combined with the Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 (voluntary Estonians in the Finnish army) and the conscripts within the Waffen SS, a total of 70,000 Estonian troops were under Nazi German arms in 1944.|$|E
