5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and {{thought it would be}} funny to have him work at a burlesque house. The problem <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E
5|$|De Laurentiis {{felt the}} only way to save the {{production}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> new director and have the script rewritten. The other production companies were not content with De Laurentiis stopping production, which led Les Films Marceau-Cocinor to terminate its contract with Italy Film. A.S. Film Produccion confiscated the footage and took cameras, costumes, and weapons that had been rented by Italy Film, which nearly bankrupted the company. De Laurentiis restarted production with financial backing from distributor Paramount Pictures, and hired Mario Bava as director. The budget was also cut to 200 million lire, {{less than half of the}} original budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because {{the two types of}} uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E

40|$|Given a {{weighted}} graph G = (V,E) and a subset R of V, a Steiner tree in G is a tree which spans all vertices in R. The vertices in V are called Steiner vertices. A full Steiner tree is a Steiner tree {{in which each}} vertex of R is a leaf. The full Steiner tree problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> full Steiner tree with minimum weight. The bottleneck full Steiner tree problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> full Steiner tree which minimizes {{the length of the}} longest edge. The k-bottleneck full Steiner tree problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> bottleneck full Steiner tree with at most k Steiner vertices. The smallest full Steiner tree problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> full Steiner tree with the minimum number of Steiner vertices. We present some results on the hardness of these problems. The presented reductions show the connection between the full Steiner tree, the group Steiner tree, and the connected set cover problems. ...|$|R
5|$|On September 23, {{just days}} after the storm moved through, President George W. Bush {{declared}} New Castle County, Delaware as a disaster area following the effects of Henri and later Hurricane Isabel. The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities. By two months after the storm, 659residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD). 141small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5million (2003USD, $2.75million 2006USD). In addition, FEMA received 183applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings. Over twentyvolunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local landfills, totaling to more than 300tons. State and county governments in Delaware purchased 171homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage. The house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland.|$|E
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{director for}} Project Y, {{the group that}} would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice {{was one of the}} three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} lambda {{calculus}} terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, {{and even on}} themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> set D isomorphic to the function space D → D, of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such D can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from D to D has greater cardinality than D, unless D is a singleton set.|$|E

Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> legal way for President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012, when his second and last government period was expected to end.

40|$|Abstract. This paper studies pattern {{detection}} of Web documents {{with the same}} type of contents using pattern languages. The pattern detection problem of the documents <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> descriptive regular pattern of input strings such that successive variables do not appear in the pattern. Our pattern detection approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> set of substrings of input strings instead of to detect a pattern of the strings directly. The set is called a component set. It divides each input string into colored regions and non-colored regions. This paper proposes an algorithm to generate a pattern from the two regions. Under this approach, the pattern detection problem is replaced as the problem that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> component set. ...|$|R

Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, Raw and SmackDown!.|$|E
25|$|Sales of {{fair trade}} {{products}} only really {{took off with}} the arrival of the first Fairtrade certification initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels. The problem <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.|$|E
25|$|The fearful stayed home. The actual {{migrants}} looked beyond {{fears of}} the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to face many challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and tornadoes that rain down snakes, fish and frogs, {{as well as the}} occasional range disputes. Homesteaders have to build their homes with sod, which were called as Sod Houses. One of the greatest plague that hit the homesteaders was the 1874 Locust Plague which devastated the Great Plains. These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Bhutan was {{reported}} to have evicted some number of Nepali-speaking residents (Bhutanese reports say about 5,000 and Refugee reports says over 100,000) from districts in southern Bhutan, creating a large refugee community that was now being detained in seven temporary United Nations refugee camps in Nepal and Sikkim. The actual numbers were difficult to establish, as many of those in the camps were reported to be holding forged identity papers, and impoverished Nepalese citizens and started to migrate to the Nepalese community leaving their refugee camps. The reason for leaving refugee camps <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job, and services to those living in camps. Few of them returned to the refugee camps. As a result, the number of people living in the camps decreased exponentially. Although the Bhutanese government claimed that only about 5000 initially left the country, the number of actual migration was more than that.|$|E
25|$|Hødd was {{established}} on 1 August 1919 and the club's first task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> suitable location {{to play football}} games. As a temporary arrangement, a football field was rented for the inaugural season for NOK400. The first location which was considered was to purchase land at Holsekerdalen, but a clause in the contract resulted in 15 of 17 members voted against the purchase at a member meeting on 25 September. Instead the club landed on Høddvoll, which was partitioned out of the farm Støylane {{and approved by the}} members on 13 February 1920. The main advantage of Høddvoll over Holsekerdalen was that the former allowed for a future expansion of the facilities. The club borrowed 3,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), which was guaranteed by all adult members and some supporters. Construction stated the same year and by March 1921 NOK8,800 had been invested in the venue. Financing was aided by a grant of NOK2,000 from the Football Association of Norway (NFF). The venue opened that year, initially with a gravel pitch.|$|E
25|$|When Post {{defined the}} notion of a simple set as an r.e. set with an {{infinite}} complement not containing any infinite r.e. set, he started to study the structure of the recursively enumerable sets under inclusion. This lattice became a well-studied structure. Recursive sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is recursive if and only if the set and its complement are both recursively enumerable. Infinite r.e. sets have always infinite recursive subsets; but on the other hand, simple sets exist but do not have a coinfinite recursive superset. Post (1944) introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets; later maximal sets were constructed which are r.e. sets such that every r.e. superset is either a finite variant of the given maximal set or is co-finite. Post's original motivation in the study of this lattice <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the Turing degree of the recursive sets nor in the Turing degree of the halting problem. Post did not find such a property and the solution to his problem applied priority methods instead; Harrington and Soare (1991) found eventually such a property.|$|E
