5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minorities</b> from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced by <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minorities</b> in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance {{in the industry}} for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Faculty attrition, {{particularly}} among female <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> faculty, {{is a serious}} problem in academic medical settings. The reasons why faculty in academic medical settings choose to leave their employment are not well understood. Further, it is not clear if the reasons why <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> faculty leave differ from those of other groups. Methods: One hundred sixty-six medical school faculty who left the School of Medicine (SOM) between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2005, completed a survey about their reasons for leaving. Results: The three most common overall reasons for leaving the institution included career/professional advancement (29. 8 %), low salary (25. 5 %), and chairman/departmental leadership issues (22. 4 %). The ranking of these reasons varied slightly across racial and gender groups, with <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> faculty also citing personal reasons for leaving. <b>Women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> faculty were at lower academic ranks at the time they left the SOM compared with male and majority groups. Although salary differences were not present at the time of initial hire, sex {{was a significant predictor of}} lower salary at the start of the new position. Opportunity for advancement and the rate of promotion were significantly different between <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men. Job characteristics prior to leaving that were rated most poorly were protected time for teaching and research, communication across the campus, and patient parking. Harassment and discrimination were reported by a small number of those surveyed, particularly <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> faculty. Conclusions: The majority of reasons for faculty attrition are amenable to change. Retaining high-quality faculty in medical settings may justify the costs of faculty development and retention efforts...|$|R
