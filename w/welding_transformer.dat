Transformer oil is generally used as a coolant in <b>welding</b> <b>transformers,</b> power transformers and electromotive units. After a prolonged use in these devices, the transformer oil becomes waste and is disposed of. The disposal of used transformer oil (UTO) causes an environmental pollution. However, the UTO has properties {{that are similar to}} that of diesel fuel with a marginally higher viscosity and lower calorific value. The present investigation is aimed to reuse the UTO as a possible source of energy to run a small powered, single cylinder, four stroke, air cooled, direct injection (DI) diesel engine. Different techniques such as blending, operating the engine with different injection timings, nozzle opening pressures, compression ratios, preheating and dual fuel mode were adopted to study the engine behavior in terms of combustion, performance and emission when the engine is fueled with the UTO. The results are analyzed and compared with diesel operation of the same engine and presented in this thesis. Initially, UTO and six of its diesel blends on varying the UTO concentration from 10 % to 60 %, at a regular interval of 10 % by volume basis was used. Increase in thermal efficiency with significant improvement in reduction of smoke was observed for UTO and its diesel blends compared to that of diesel. The nitric oxide (NO) emission was found to be higher for UTO and its diesel blends than that of diesel. Ignition delay was marginally shorter for the UTO and its diesel blends than diesel. The higher NO emission was due to advancement of injection timing as a result of bulk modulus characteristics of the UTO. Secondly, UTO was operated at different injection timings of advanced and retarded injection timings for maximum of 3 degree crank angle (oCA) at a regular interval of 1. 5 oCA from the original injection timings of 23 oCA bTDC. When compared to the standard injection timing of 23 obTDC and other injection timings tested for UTO, the retarded injection timing of 20 obTDC resulted in a reduction in the NO emission by about 1. 4 % at an expense of smoke emission and brake specific energy consumption by about 6. 7 % and 1. 1 % respectively at full load.

The traditional approach in relation tospot welding machines {{is to use}} 50 Hz <b>welding</b> <b>transformers.</b> Thedrawback associated with these transformers {{is that they are}} both heavyand bulky. Moreover, the fusing requirements become larger due toincreased welding power. With the development of high power semiconductor switches andDC-DC converter topologies, it is now possible to develop inverterdrive resistance spot welding equipment (RSE) which can be operatedat frequencies higher than the 50 Hz frequency. The advantage of usinghigh frequencies is the reduction {{in the size of the}} transformer. Moreover, the fusing requirements are relaxed, as the power is sharedbetween three phases. In many industrial applications long welding arms are requiredbetween the <b>transformer</b> and the <b>weld</b> spot, which increases theinductance. The parasitic inductance in welding arms limits themaximum rate of change of the current. In order achieve a higher powerthe current has to be rectified. To rectify a current of the order of tenthof kA is challenging task and is one of the major sources of loss. The full bridge converter topology is used for the inverter drive RSE. The power switches used in the converter are IGBT. In RSE, the DClink capacitors are used to store high energy. In the case of circuitfailure, the stored energy can cause the IGBT device to rupture and inorder to avoid this, a protection scheme is discussed in this work.

5000|$|In {{electronic}} circuits, transformers and inductors with ferromagnetic cores operate nonlinearly {{when the}} current through them {{is large enough to}} drive their core materials into saturation. This means that their inductance and other properties vary with changes in drive current. In linear circuits this is usually considered an unwanted departure from ideal behavior. When AC signals are applied, this nonlinearity can cause the generation of harmonics and intermodulation distortion. To prevent this, the level of signals applied to iron core inductors must be limited so they don't saturate. To lower its effects, an air gap is created in some kinds of transformer cores. [...] The saturation current, the current through the winding required to saturate the magnetic core, is given by manufacturers in the specifications for many inductors and transformers. [...] On the other hand, saturation is exploited in some electronic devices. Saturation is employed to limit current in saturable-core transformers, used in arc <b>welding,</b> and ferroresonant <b>transformers</b> which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its saturation region, limiting further increases in secondary current. In a more sophisticated application, saturable core inductors and magnetic amplifiers use a DC current through a separate winding to control an inductor's impedance. Varying the current in the control winding moves the operating point {{up and down in the}} saturation curve, controlling the AC current through the inductor. These are used in variable fluorescent light ballasts, and power control systems.|$|R

To determine the performance of <b>welding</b> <b>transformer</b> and then made three winding transformer with different variations of 365, 635 and 1000 pda primary windings and three windings on all transformers in the secondary chart. Tests carried out on three plates with a thickness. of the test result berfariasi weld. From the third transformer 365 transformer that can only be used to weld on the plate 0. 1 and 0. 3 whereas in 0. 5 plate a long time [...] Another transformer is only capable of melting the surface of the plate. From these tests it is concluded that home-based electric power can be used to weld. 365 transformer windings can be used to weld with an output of V = 1. 8 and I = 475. with the 365 th transformer windings can be made a spot welding machine scale cottage industries. With 365 transformer windings capable of connecting plate well and no damage on the surface of the plate...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} work is a {{comparative}} analysis of chemical compounds influence {{on the process of}} electric arc forming and condition of its burning. Methodology. Material for an electrode was a wire 3 mm in diameter of low carbon steel with contain of carbon 0. 15 %. As chemical compounds, which determine the terms of forming of arc welding were used kaolin; CaCO 3 with the admixtures of gypsum to 60 %; SiO 2 and Fe – Si with the iron concentration to 50 %. Researches were conducted at the use of direct electric current and the arc of reverse polarity. As a source of electric current the <b>welding</b> <b>transformer</b> of type PSO- 500 was used. On the special stand an initial gap between the electrode and metal-plate was equal to 1 – 1. 5 mm. The interelectrode interval was filled with the probed chemical compounds and it was formed an electric arc. In the moment of electric arc arise the values of electric current and the arc voltage were determined. After the natural break of electric arc, the final size of the gap between electrodes was accepted as the maximal value of the arc lengths. Findings. In the conditions of experiment the metal transfer in interelectrode interval corresponded to the drop mechanism. According to external characteristics the ratio between the maximal arc length and the power of electric discharge has the appearance of exponential dependence. Specific power of electric arc characterizes environment of interelectrode interval in the moment of arc forming per unit of its length. Originality. 1. On the basis of influence analysis of the studied chemical compounds on the formation processes of electric arc inversely proportional relationship between the power of the electric current and the maximum arc length to the moment of its natural break is defined. 2. The ratio between the maximal arc length and the power of electric current with sufficiently high correlation coefficient is subjected to the exponential dependence. Influence of the studied compounds on the process of electric arc forming is determined using the degree values of the obtained ratio. 3. The value of specific power of electric current in the moment of electric arc forming per unit of its length can be accepted as the parameter, which characterizes the environment in the interelectrode interval. Practical value. In the conditions of identical adjusting strength of electric current it is determined the gradation of the studied chemical compounds in the order of increase of their influence on the process of the arc burning. Kaolin has the minimum influence and Fe – Si – the maximal one...|$|E
