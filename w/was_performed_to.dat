5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as the}} heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was {{originally}} cast {{to play the role}} of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns. Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher. As a result, the role was recast and given to Barney Martin — who had no idea that another actor had already established the part. In this episode Kramer greets Morty by name.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fire, the {{government}} of Madagascar established the Direction nationale des opérations Rova (DNOR, or National Office of Rova Operations), a body directed by four national experts within Madagascar's Ministry of Culture who were tasked with developing and overseeing plans for {{the reconstruction of the}} Rova. Two years after the fire, several key milestones in the process had been achieved, with objects recovered from the fire inventoried, site excavations completed, preliminary restoration plans for Manjakamiadana developed, and work on the royal chapel initiated. A ramp was also built to enable site access for the necessary heavy construction vehicles. Prior to work commencing, a traditional ceremony <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> restore the sanctity of the site, which had served a dual role as both a physical tomb and spiritual link to venerated ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Shuri-ryū {{also has}} several short combinations. These include: 26 ippon (ippon kumite kata), which <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> develop form and power; 10 taezu (taezu naru waza) which <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> develop speed and fluidity; 30 kihon which <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> develop {{fighting}} technique; eight sen-te motions; and seven kogeki-ho ho to develop attacking and retreating.|$|R
50|$|On this {{occasion}} poojas would <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> Lord Shakthi Ganpathi, Manonmani Devi, Chandikeshwara and Veerabhadraswamy. Later poojas shall <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> Arakeshwara, Pathalaeswara, Maraleshwara and Mallikarjuneswara.|$|R
50|$|Visesha Puja <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> on Mondays {{when the}} 'Chaturdasa kalasa visesha puja' (14 kalasas special puja) <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> the Lord through the utsava murti.

5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were an}} actual battle.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{ski jumping}} debuted at these championships which was won by American Lindsay Van. She {{was also the}} first North American to medal in ski jumping and the first American woman to medal at the championships. One the men's side, Austria was the big winner with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl (golds in men's {{individual}} normal hill and team large hill events) and Gregor Schlierenzauer (gold in team large hill and silver in individual normal hill events). Both Loitzl and Schlierenzauer, World Cup leaders prior to the championships, joined Switzerland's Simon Ammann in the podium of the individual normal hill event. Ammann's teammate Andreas Küttel won gold in the individual large hill event in which only one jump <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> unstable weather conditions. Norway also won three medals in the championships with a silver in the team large hill and bronzes from Anders Jacobsen (individual large hill) and Anette Sagen (women's individual normal hill).|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor. The skid landing gear also had streamlined fairings applied {{to it and}} the rotor mast {{was replaced by a}} mast that could be tilted in-flight.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 2012, {{a team of}} 40 people, {{including}} Prince Andrew, Duke of York, abseiled {{from the}} tower's 87th floor. This feat <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> {{raise money for the}} Outward Bound Trust and the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. In November 2012, the French urban climber Alain Robert was spotted in the building by security guards. At the end of the month, the Shard's owners won an injunction to prevent him from entering or climbing the building.|$|E
25|$|The Passion Play of Iztapalapa has {{its origin}} in an {{outbreak}} of cholera in 1833, which left many dead and many children orphaned. A procession <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> an image of Christ called the “Señor de la Cuevita” (Lord of the Little Cave) to end the epidemic. When it subsided, it was considered a miracle and various cults to this Christ figure appeared. Expressions of gratitude to this figure eventually consolidated into two annual events. The first is a Mass in honor of this images, {{now known as the}} Fiesta de Solteras de Septiembre. The second is the annual Passion Play.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1923, a {{decision}} was made to redesign the racer and in the months following, a completely new design emerged with the original landplane being converted into a floatplane. Radical surgery <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> turn the sesquiplane into a biplane, with strutted wings, wing surface radiators, enlarged tail surfaces and a set of floats also part of the redesign. Fitted with a new, more powerful 700hp Wright T-3, a development of the T-2 and a three-blade propeller, the second of the NW series was designated NW-2 and was entered into the 1923 Schneider Trophy held at Cowes, Isle of Wight.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will probably end up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E
25|$|Great Danes have {{naturally}} floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were {{commonly used}} to hunt boars, cropping of the ears <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily companion animals, cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up. Today, the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Germany, and parts of Australia and New Zealand, the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} {{correlation}} between the size of the group {{and the size of the}} patch; however this correlation provides no implication that subordinate group members have less resources. More likely, it is the effects of the patch size on the group member that dominates interactions. An experiment <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> study the mechanism responsible for the positive correlation between the group size and patch size. The scientists argued that the correlation between the group size and patch size is because of the indirect consequence of the positive relationship between the dominant group member’s length and the anemone size. The length of the dominant group member limits the group size because the length of the dominant group member prevents the group of the subordinate group members. This data shows that the patch size and group size correlation does not necessarily imply the decrease in resources of group members subordinate to the dominant group member.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability {{was so important}} to the overall design success of the suspension structure. [...] Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{the tunnel}} was renovated in 1947. Additional work <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> secure the {{structure}} against water damage. In 1949, the tunnel {{was used as a}} warehouse by Malina, a food production company. A document dating to 31 October 1949 proposed the construction of another corridor connecting the existing one to the area of Gupčeva Zvijezda, about [...] to the north. There is no evidence that this corridor was ever constructed. However, the NDH plan's central hall, measuring almost [...] in length, was built sometime after. Emil Matešić, the director of the Cultural Informative Centre of Zagreb (...) , believed that its construction was driven by the Cold War tensions and carried out in secret with some documents concerning the tunnel not having been released by the Croatian Ministry of Defence as of July 2016.|$|E
