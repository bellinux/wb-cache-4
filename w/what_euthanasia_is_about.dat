40|$|Euthanasia: A Confounding and Intricate Issue is {{a chapter}} in Euthanasia - The "Good Death" Controversy in Humans and Animals, edited by Josef Kuře (2011) and {{published}} online by InTech. <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> still illegal in most countries. Nevertheless {{it is one of}} the most-debated ethical issues in recent decades, as revealed by the considerable number of scientific publications, the media coverage of specific cases, and proposed legislation in many countries. One of the most significant challenge in order to have an informed debate on this issue <b>is</b> to define <b>euthanasia</b> It <b>is</b> often associated with “wanting to die with dignity”, “not wanting to be kept alive against one’s wishes”, “not wanting to suffer”, and “wanting to die rather than live in a certain condition”. Among members of the public and even health care practitioners, the term is used to refer to situations ranging from the last injection allowing a person to pass from life; to death in a context of incurable illness through withholding treatment that would do more harm than good (futile treatment) and withdrawing life support that keeps the person alive (mechanical ventilation, feeding and hydration tubes); to relieving the pain and other symptoms of persons at the end of life whose next breath may well be their last. This chapter delineates what is meant by the term euthanasia, and to see how the various interpretations of this term lead to confusion and misunderstanding that often render debate pointless. Part 2 describes <b>what</b> <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> now considered to consist in, and puts it in perspectives with other types of end-of-life decisions that characteristically arise in medical practice. Part 3 lists studies that have attempted to clarify people’s understandings of euthanasia and particularly in relation to other end-of-life practices. Part 4 discusses the interpersonal, societal and political issues raised by these varied understandings of euthanasia according to various groups. University of Ottawa Author Fun...|$|R
40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the nursing ethics arguments on euthanasia in general, and on nurses’ involvement in euthanasia in particular, through an argument-based literature review. An in-depth study of these arguments in this literature will enable nurses to engage in the euthanasia debate. We critically appraised 41 publications published between January 1987 and June 2007. Nursing ethics arguments on (nurses’ involvement in) <b>euthanasia</b> <b>are</b> guided primarily by the principles of respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice. Ethical arguments related to the nursing profession are described. From a care perspective, we discuss arguments that evaluate to <b>what</b> degree <b>euthanasia</b> can <b>be</b> considered positively or negatively as a form of good nursing care. Most arguments in the principle-, profession- and care-orientated approaches to nursing ethics are used both pro and contra euthanasia in general, and nurses’ involvement in euthanasia in particular. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{major reason}} that The Netherlands {{has taken a}} {{different}} approach {{to the rest of the}} world on such a fundamental moral issue is that the courts and legislature in that country have accorded the interests of doctors a cardinal role in the euthanasia debate. This article argues that the interests of doctors are of only incidental and peripheral relevance in relation to the moral status of euthanasia. The moral status of euthanasia has little to do with the preparedness ofdoctors to administer the lethal injection or their general attitude towards the practice. <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> principally <b>about</b> the interests of the patient and the impact that the practice may have on the community in general, not preserving the conscience or improving the working life ofdoctors...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> {{approached}} {{in the light}} of the Hippocratic principles, which have not changed with time but have only been adapted to new scientific and social developments. The definition of <b>what</b> constitutes <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> clarified and the need to avoid that semantic mutations may manipulate ideas is stressed, so that what is certainly wrong does not seem to appear as right. The uniqueness and individuality of the human being is emphasized as well as the commitment of doctors to their patients wellbeing, although at times a balance may be needed in relation to some apparently conflicting interests of society as a whole. The importance of the doctor/patient relationship is stressed, particularly in the final stages of terminal disease. Decisions concerning life and death, although preferably to be shared, still rest most times upon the doctor's shoulders alone. The respect for the wishes of the patients, their right to know the truth and its limits, the use of the living will, the right to die in dignity, the use of ordinary or extraordinary means of treatment, the concept of brain death and the rules for resuscitation, are commented upon. In all cases, the need for a global and individualized approach is mandatory before any final decision is made. Total respect for human life, from its beginning to its end is emphasized, intentional killing, for whatever reason or motivation, is firmly rejected. Reference is made to national and international codes of ethics as well as to declarations and statements of the World Medical Association.

The design of the study was exploratory/descriptive and asked the following questions: ''Some discussions have expressed similarities between Nazi Germany and euthanasia. Do you believe the comparison is justified? In <b>what</b> ways <b>are</b> <b>euthanasia</b> and the holocaust similar? In what ways are they different?'' Participants concluded that profound differences existed between Nazi Germany and socially assisted dying. These differences were established from four different perspectives in 10 different themes, and demonstrated by 24 different examples of the themes. Informants further cautioned philosophers about comparisons between the holocaust and other human behaviors. The survivors perceived that such a comparison has negative consequences for their own well-being, the dignity of their family members, the next generation and the Israeli society.

40|$|The {{following}} research aims at unfolding an authentic Christian attitude to euthanasia {{by means of}} a comparative analysis of Christian bioethical thinking and practice in Russia and in the West. It seeks to establish <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>euthanasia,</b> whether it <b>is</b> incompatible with Christianity and, if so, what is the alternative. The first chapter explores the meaning of 'euthanasia', comparing and rethinking a number of definitions from the existing multitude. Through the psychological thicket of slogans such as "mercy killing", "personal autonomy" and "death with dignity" the core characteristic of euthanasia - deadly intention - is hardly ever seen. With some notable exceptions with regard to self-defence, just war, or capital punishment, in Christianity intending to kill has always been regarded as a grave sin of breaking the sixth commandment. The second chapter shows how Western Christian bioethics has gone from the ethics of Paul Ramsey to the ethics of Tristram Engelhardt, from balancing between justifying certain forms of intentional killing while condemning others to purifying one's heart and cultivating one's soul in order to prevent the formation of an intention to kill. The third chapter is dedicated to the development of Christian bioethics in Russia. In a country with over a millennium of Orthodox tradition there is an exceptional opportunity for the bioethical framework of Engelhardt to settle in naturally. The fourth chapter presents a number of well-publicized medical situations in Britain where choices between life and death were exercised. The analysis based on the material of the previous chapters shows most of them to be clear cases of euthanasia, while others have a recognizable potential to be described as such. The history and an ongoing story of the modem hospice movement - a living alternative to <b>euthanasia</b> - <b>are</b> the focus of the fifth and last chapter of this dissertation. Its core ability - to live with suffering - sustains the opposition to <b>euthanasia</b> and <b>is</b> essentially a Christian virtue...|$|R

50|$|<b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> {{categorized}} {{in different}} ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> legal in some countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. Involuntary euthanasia (without asking consent {{or against the}} patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder. As of 2006, <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> the most active area of research in contemporary bioethics.|$|R
50|$|Non-voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> <b>euthanasia</b> {{conducted}} {{when the}} explicit {{consent of the}} individual concerned is unavailable, such as when the person is in a persistent vegetative state, {{or in the case}} of young children.

50|$|The {{entitlement}} of {{a person}} {{to make the decision}} to end their own life through <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> commonly called a right to choose, while people who oppose the legalization of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>are</b> commonly referred to as the right-to-lifers.|$|R

40|$|Background In 2002, Belgium set a legal {{framework}} for euthanasia, whereby granting and performing <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> entrusted entirely to physicians, and-as advised by Belgian Medical Deontology-in {{the context of}} a trusted patient-physician relationship. <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is,</b> however, rarely practiced, so the average physician will not attain routine in this matter. Aim To explore how general practitioners in Flanders (Belgium) deal with <b>euthanasia.</b> This <b>was</b> performed via qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with 52 general practitioners (GPs). Results Although GPs can understand a patient's request for euthanasia, their own willingness to perform it is limited, based on their assumption that legal euthanasia equates to an injection that ends life abruptly. Their willingness to perform <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> affected by the demanding nature of a patient's request, by their views on <b>what</b> circumstances render <b>euthanasia</b> legitimate and by their own ability to inject a lethal dose. Several GPs prefer increasing opioid dosages and palliative sedation to a lethal injection, which they consider to fall outside the scope of euthanasia legislation. Conclusions Four attitudes can be identified: (1) willing to perform euthanasia; (2) only willing to perform as a last resort; (3) feeling incapable of performing; (4) refusing on principle. The situation where GPs have to consider the request and-if they grant it-to perform the act may result in arbitrary access to euthanasia for the patient. The possibility of installing transparent referral and support strategies for the GPs should be further examined. Further discussion is needed in the medical profession about the exact content of the euthanasia law...|$|R

40|$|Partisans of {{euthanasia}} {{believe that}} they can justify it in terms of moral, and that only voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> should <b>be</b> legalized. In other words, only patients who expresses clearly and repeatedly their desire to die could resort lawfully to <b>euthanasia.</b> This view <b>is</b> based on the right to self-determination, freedom and dignity of the person, principles that represent the fundamental values of a society. However, in addition to those who support the need of <b>euthanasia,</b> there <b>are</b> still many who are against it, or treat this concept with skepticism. There are series of arguments that change the balance in favor of the ones who do not approve euthanasia. A first argument that seeks legalization of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> based on an ideal vision of hospitals, doctors, nurses and families (and this vision is often the fruit of imagination, so the idea of voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> one danger). Another key argument against legalizing <b>euthanasia</b> <b>was</b> that is practically impossible to draw up a law to protect doctors who practice euthanasia without sliding towards the inevitable abuses. The final argument against legalizing <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> a legal one. Current law condemns euthanasia considering it a murder, and this argument is sustained practically by all treaties and codes. The Constitution guarantees the “right to life” and the concept of euthanasia violates deeply this fundamental principle...|$|R
