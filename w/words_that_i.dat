500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated {{that some things}} he said {{may have led to}} the assassination of MalcolmX. [...] "I may have been complicit in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spoke", he said. [...] "I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being." [...] A few days later Farrakhan denied that he [...] "ordered the assassination" [...] of MalcolmX, although he again acknowledged that he [...] "created the atmosphere that ultimately led to MalcolmX's assassination." ...|$|E
500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. We talk about it, she writes down <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E
500|$|John's Gospel {{presents}} {{the teachings of}} Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in : [...] "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." [...] In [...] Jesus says, [...] "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." [...] He asserts {{the same thing in}} : [...] "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works." ...|$|E

60|$|Another {{messenger}} now entered with <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was still}} within the palace walls.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. M. Ugly <b>word,</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> {{should never}} {{have the courage to}} own up.|$|R
2500|$|... "Nothing to Prove", {{an adult}} {{contemporary}} song, {{was written by}} Dan Dean {{in response to the}} death of a close friend and church member's father. [...] "I'll never forget the morning he called and said, 'My dad is gone,'" [...] Dean recalled. [...] "It was brilliant and sad, and I went into the chapel with a heavy heart asking God what I could do, and out came this song with <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope can be said about me someday." ...|$|E

2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
5000|$|... "On <b>that</b> day, <b>I</b> made {{a promise}} to an old man, as grand master of my {{jurisdiction}} and man of my <b>word,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] replied Alnaschar, [...] "I {{am ready}} {{to tell you the}} whole story, but give, I pray you, your <b>word,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall run no risk of punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] {{he cried}} in a high, {{screaming}} voice. [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of this intrusion? Didn't <b>I</b> send you <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would see you to-morrow morning?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Arghezi {{later wrote}} that his {{relationship}} with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the grefier panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: [...] "he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as Urmuz than under his own name". The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buzău's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: [...] "He would {{wake up in the}} middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with a eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [...] to change phrases and <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his." [...] The letters they exchanged show that the grefier was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: [...] "from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice".|$|E
2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E
60|$|As I spoke I smiled grimly that {{he might}} know without <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> distrusted him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every one of them. I really don't suppose <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to}} show my face here at all. I have simply come to say good-bye. There is just a single <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{want to say to}} Anne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} he will be here anon," [...] replied the host. [...] "I have sent him <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> desired speech with him on {{business}} of the State and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> craved the honour of his company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friedmund von Adlerstein, give me thy solemn <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{never again}} hear of this freak of turning priest or hermit. What! art slow to speak? Thinkest me {{too bad for}} thee?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then he was {{borne out}} {{and these were}} the last <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever heard him utter.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is Mr. Sherwin's daughter--" [...] The <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would fain {{have spoken}} next, seemed to suffocate me. I was silent again.|$|E
60|$|I said, without {{intent to}} hurt, but with heedless choice of <b>words,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could not see}} {{that we had been}} living such an {{abandoned}} life.|$|E
60|$|I {{might have}} {{suspected}} other people of purposely denying themselves to me. But {{it was impossible}} to suspect Rachel. <b>I</b> left <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would call again at six o'clock that evening.|$|R
6000|$|Wyllard thanked him, {{and then}} {{looked him in the}} eyes. [...] "There is a long journey before us, and you have only my <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will take nothing but these things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, both of {{them came}} once, and Flockley came after <b>that,</b> but <b>I</b> refused to see them. Mr. Flockley wished to bring me to see this game, but <b>I</b> sent <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going with papa." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{minister}} {{explained in}} a few <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been received into the Emperor's personal service, and Josephine congratulated me upon it with the most kindly sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|All this haltingly, {{and with}} difficulty. Then {{he had an}} inspiration, and began to pour out a flood of <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could make nothing of; so I said: ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{stretch out}} my hand, {{and from the}} further shore I bid adieu to all who have cared to read any among the many <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mama,' said Florence, 'he {{has lost}} his fortune; he {{has been at the}} point of death; he may not recover, even now. <b>Is</b> there any <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall say to him from you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had such}} a hard time of it," [...] pleaded Abner. [...] "It made things easier to her, my giving her my <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would always look after the boy. You'll help me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wonder, perhaps, {{to see me}} {{with your}} uncle. I give you my <b>word</b> <b>that</b> it is a dinner of {{courtesy}} only. I give you my <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not opened my lips on political matters. I {{have been waiting for}} your answer." ...|$|R
60|$|But he only answered: 'Tell me {{the magic}} <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may disenchant him myself;' {{and as she}} would not he ordered his dog to bite her up to the hip.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so taken}} aback by his <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not lay my tongue to an answer, but {{coloured}} up and looked askance, like the awkward country lad that I was.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, I knew, while I {{said those}} <b>words,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{secretly}} intended {{to revisit the}} site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake. Yes, even so. For Estella's sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I gave Mr. Lacy my <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would lock you up, and I'll {{have to do}} it. I'll see to it, however, {{that you}} suffer no discomforts while {{you are in the}} guardroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not expect}} to see you so soon again, colonel. Your man brought me <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not to come this morning, as you would be engaged," [...] the {{sergeant}} said when he entered.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's little fear of his coming," [...] McQueen assured her, gently, [...] "but if he {{does come}} I give you my solemn <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't let him take you away {{unless you want to}} go." ...|$|R
