Tiresias's mother Chariclo intervened on his behalf and begged Athena to have mercy. Athena could not restore Tiresias's eyesight, so instead she gave him the ability to understand the language of the birds and thus foretell the future.|$|E

500|$|Go Man Go was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1990. A further honor was the naming of a stakes race after him, the Grade I Go Man Go Handicap run in September at Los Alamitos. Walt Wiggins, a racing commentator and author, said of Go Man Go: [...] "He was a brilliant speedhorse, some say the fastest ever. He was wild and reckless, a rogue at first, and often a clown who seldom saw the uniqueness of his talents or the seriousness of his commission. He had intrinsic greatness and couldn't care less." [...] Dan Essary, who was Director of Racing for the AQHA for many years, described Go Man Go's impact on the Quarter Horse breed as [...] "He was to Quarter Horse racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what Ben Hogan was to Golf and <b>what</b> <b>Man</b> o'War was to Thoroughbred racing. Horses may have run faster and horses have earned more money, but the fame of Go Man Go lingers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Old Testament was {{compiled}} and edited by various men {{over a period}} of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BC. [...] The works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious). Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of <b>what</b> <b>man</b> once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. <b>What</b> <b>man</b> doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, the sad thing is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E
2500|$|Ray is head chef at The Queen Victoria, is in a {{relationship}} with Kat's friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and is trusted by Alfie, of which Inside Soap said an affair [...] "seems unimaginable, but might he surprise us with his actions?" [...] They called Ray [...] "eye candy" [...] for Kat, saying [...] "it's never a bad thing" [...] for her, and noted that she appreciates him as her head chef. For Kat to have an affair with Ray would not only mean betraying Alfie but also Kim. They felt that Ray was the most obvious choice, and had not yet had a major storyline, and an affair would shock viewers and have a big impact on Ray's family life. They also said that they would not blame Kat for an affair with Ray as he is [...] "gorgeous, sensitive and has a six-pack to die for". Soaplife opined that Ray was the [...] "red herring", as actor Venn has said he would like Ray to marry Kim and start a family, and later said that all hints were pointing to Ray, so [...] "it would be no kind of mystery if it is him." [...] All About Soap said that Ray's [...] "flirty banter with Kat has sent her into a spin", but were not sure Ray would be the one having the affair, especially after Kat picks Alfie for the football team over Ray, and made him joint third most likely, along with Derek. The magazine later opined that [...] "lovely" [...] Ray would not have it in him to cheat, but thought he may have tired of Kim's behaviour. Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and <b>what</b> <b>man</b> wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father, but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way..." [...] Venn also said, [...] "I would love it to be me—for the drama, of course. Why not? You can just imagine the kind of drama which would ensue with Kim. It'd be fight of the century, that one. Dynasty would have nothing on this!" [...] Venn also {{said in an interview that}} he was looking forward to kissing scenes with Wallace, implying that Ray could be Kat's lover. Ray was the first of the five suspects to be eliminated, on 7 August 2012.|$|E
