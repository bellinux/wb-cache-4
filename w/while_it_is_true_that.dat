5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E

Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E

5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
25|$|<b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} often no {{statutory}} maximum age limit to perform an adoption, and adopted children are often treated the same as natural children, so an 86-year-old woman who adopts a newborn child is legally {{in the same position}} as an 86-year-old woman who gives birth, the fertile octogenarian rule predates the laws allowing legal adoption.|$|E

25|$|Globalization allows {{corporations}} to outsource manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities {{with the most}} competitive wages and worker benefits. Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually agricultural productions. Larger countries often subsidize their farmers (e.g., the EU's Common Agricultural Policy), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.|$|E
25|$|<b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> {{very little}} detail of Hephaestion’s {{childhood}} and {{education can be}} found, that which remains gives credence to {{what is known about}} his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander’s empire, second only to the king himself.|$|E
25|$|An {{altogether}} different argument challenged {{that since the}} Nazis destroyed massive sets of sensitive documents pertaining to the Holocaust upon the arrival of Soviet and Western Ally troops, no truly comprehensive, verifiable historical reconstruction could be achieved.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews.

25|$|The {{weakness}} of the Vaishnava origins theory is that it conflates two systems. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the Vaishnava Hindus in the eastern region of India worshipped the triad of Balarama, Ekanamsa and Krishna, it does not automatically prove that the Jagannath triad originated from the same. Some medieval texts, for example, present the Jagannath triad as Brahma (Subhadra), Shiva (Balarama) and Vishnu. The historic evidence and current practices suggest that the Jagannath tradition has a strong dedication to the Harihara (fusion Shiva-Vishnu) idea as well as tantric Sri Vidya practices, neither of which reconcile with the Vaishnava origins proposal. Further, in many Jagannath temples {{of central and eastern}} regions of India, the Shiva icons such as the Linga-yoni are reverentially incorporated, a fact that is difficult to explain given the assumed competition between the Shaivism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|In fact, as king of Scots David {{pursued the}} goals anyone in his {{position}} {{would be expected to}} pursue. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> David established himself in power with the backing of Henry I and his own Anglo-Norman retainers, as king his expansion also impinged upon areas that were Norse and English in speech using forces taken from his own Gaelic territories. David used the forces at his disposal. In doing so David's position in Scotland was largely successful. Not only did he survive to die a peaceful death, but he retained hold of his core territory in east-central Scotland, introduced more direct royal control into Moray and beyond, while men from Argyll, the Hebrides and Galloway were could be brought into David's 1136-8 invasion host. David's failings were that he did not succeed in permanently incorporating the Orkney Islands into his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It {{is important to recognize}} that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In 23 BC, Augustus (as Octavian {{now called}} himself) again {{attempted}} {{to reform the}} constitution, {{although it is not}} known why he chose to reform the constitution at this point. Four years had passed since his last reforms, and this may have given him the opportunity to discover the weaknesses in those reforms. In addition, he almost died in 23 BC, and thus he may have thought that his time left was short. To Augustus, one major weakness in his constitution was his status as Consul. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> his prestige minimized the risk of obstruction {{at the hands of a}} co-Consul, this risk still existed. It was also unusual (and unprecedented) for an individual to be elected to the Consulship nine times in a row, as Augustus had been. In addition, tradition did subject the Consulship to certain restrictions, such as the traditional etiquette shown by the two Consuls towards each other. While Augustus did consider the possibility to making himself sole Consul, he realized that this was too radical of a departure from tradition. Therefore, as a 'concession', he gave up his Consulship, and modified both his Proconsular imperium and his Tribunician powers. It is not known exactly how Augustus modified his Proconsular imperium, but it is known that he was allowed to retain this imperium in the city of Rome. Normally, any magistrate had to surrender their imperium while they were inside the city. In addition, his Proconsular imperium was formally modified to give him both a status and an authority above even a Consul.|$|E

25|$|When the Eleventh Dynasty came to power, it was {{necessary}} to subdue the power of the Nomarchs if Egypt was to be reunified under a central government. The first major steps towards that end took place under Amenemhet I. Amenemhet made the city, not the nome, the center of administration, and only the haty-a, or mayor, of the larger cities would be permitted to carry the title of Nomarch. The title of Nomarch continued to be used until the reign of Senusret III, as did the elaborate tombs indicative of their power, after which they suddenly disappear. This has been interpreted several ways. Traditionally, it has been believed that Senusret III took some action to suppress the nomarch families during his reign. Recently, other interpretations have been proposed. Detlef Franke has argued that Senusret II adopted a policy of educating the sons of nomarchs in the capital and appointing them to government posts. In this way, many provincial families may have been bled dry of scions. Also, while the title of Great Overlord of the Nome disappeared, other distinctive titles of the nomarchs remained. During the First Intermediate Period, individuals holding the title of Great Overlord also often held the title of Overseer of Priests. In the late Middle Kingdom, there exist families holding the titles of mayor and overseer of priests as hereditary possessions. Therefore, {{it has been argued that}} the great nomarch families were never subdued, but were simply absorbed into the Pharaonic administration of the country. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the large tombs indicative of nomarchs disappear at the end of the twelfth dynasty, grand royal tombs also disappear soon thereafter due to general instability surrounding the decline of the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
