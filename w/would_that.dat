5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as <b>would</b> <b>that</b> of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{involved the}} Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany. Should kibbutz members turn over income {{that was the}} product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what <b>would</b> <b>that</b> mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.|$|E

25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How <b>would</b> <b>that</b> work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which {{can be summed up in}} a single sentence, Whatsoever ye <b>would</b> <b>that</b> men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

500|$|In Inception, Nolan {{wanted to}} explore [...] "the idea of people sharing a dream space...That gives you the ability to access somebody's {{unconscious}} mind. What <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be used and abused for?" [...] The majority of the film's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always {{in a state of}} production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it. By contrast, the world of The Matrix (1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. Nolan's world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.|$|E

Notices printed by the farm began with the verse, [...] "If a Cobbler by trade, I'll make it my pride, the best of all Cobblers to be; and if only a Tinker, no Tinker on earth shall mend an old Kettle like me"; this verse and several other mottoes decorated friezes on the interior walls of the Dalmeny boarding house.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Diga Online, Suzuki described the production of her album Lead and single [...] "Blow Out". She described how difficult life was {{as a high school}} student while she was focusing on her music career. Following her graduation from high school and entering university, she felt that she had made many sacrifices for her career. The title of the album came from the idea that she had become a new person after her concert during her 20th birthday, as she wanted to [...] "lead everyone" [...] through her songs. The song [...] "My Shining Ray" [...] was written to represent a big star that <b>would</b> <b>that</b> would lead people; she also described her experience singing the song as feeling like she was spreading wings.

500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Deus Ex Machina", which introduced the Nigerian airplane, a corpse dressed as a priest with a gun, and Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin, the Lost writers decided {{that the story of}} the Beechcraft would coincide with one of the characters' flashbacks. They decided to use one of the tail section characters to be introduced in season 2, [...] "essentially a bad guy who was forced to disguise himself as a priest, and how <b>would</b> <b>that</b> come about, and could he now be presenting himself as a priest". Since Eko and Locke are both spiritual leaders on the island - but with Locke having a [...] "paganistic, ritualistic appreciation" [...] for the island's powers and Eko, [...] "pure religious faith" [...] - writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof decided to write in this episode parallels with [...] "Deus Ex Machina", where Locke and Boone find the Beechcraft. The biggest similarity is Charlie unwillingly become Eko's [...] "acolyte", just like Boone was being Locke's follower in their expedition to the airplane.|$|E

Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? <b>Would</b> <b>that</b> be OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E
