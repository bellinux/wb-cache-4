5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that we feel}} dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame {{and that is a}} dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|Druckmann's writing philosophy, {{which he}} {{realized}} while talking to game designer Cory Barlog, is [...] "simple story, complex characters"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships. Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting {{to enter the}} mindset of each individual character. He tries to ignore character tropes {{in an attempt to}} write [...] "honestly". Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself [...] "What is this scene really about? What's the least <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or do to convey that and no more?" ...|$|E
60|$|He paused. He <b>had</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, {{but it was}} not {{the thing}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{said all}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> told the {{assemblage}} {{that it might}} go home; but it didn't seem inclined to do anything of the kind.|$|R
60|$|For a long time, as it seemed, we {{remained}} silent and motionless. We'd said all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> My eyes caught a printed slip upon the desk before him, and I came back abruptly to the paper.|$|R
500|$|... "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Andy Kellman of Allmusic, Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly and editors of USA Today, all considered {{it to be}} the stand out track from No Boys Allowed. Music |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}} Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that the song, [...] "comes on like a cat fight, but it eventually reveals itself to be a tough-loving 'love yourself' anthem, a stately but danceable approximation of Dove's campaign for 'real beauty'". Music Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}} Matthew Horton of BBC Music called it a [...] "lovely single", while Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "swaggering". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that, [...] "Though Ne-Yo gives 'Pretty Girl Rock' an addictive sheen, it's the remix featuring some memorable verses from Kanye West that gets the point across best." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom praised Hilson's [...] "confidence and sweetness" [...] on the song, and described the beat as [...] "funky and sick." [...] Editors of DesiHits described [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] as an [...] "upbeat and catchy track...and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the beat really rocks!." ...|$|E
2500|$|WASPs do have {{a culture}} — traditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, {{particular}} signals and totems we pass on to one another. [...] But the WASP culture, {{or at least that}} aspect of the culture I talk about, is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> weren’t entirely bad.” In [...] "The Cocktail Hour" [...] (1988) a lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics [...] "don't like us.... They resent us. They think we're all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jazani {{would explain}} that a revolutionary status {{does not exist}} in the country and in {{addition}} to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes [...] "When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one." ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{the world-famous}} Twentieth of June, more worthy {{to be called}} the Procession of the Black Breeches. With which, what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of this First French {{biennial}} Parliament, and its products and activities, may perhaps fitly enough terminate.|$|R
60|$|I, on {{the other}} hand, was in favour of {{following}} the road we knew, which, although long and very wearisome, was comparatively safe, as in that vast desert there were few people to attack us, while Oliver, our captain, listened <b>to</b> all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and reserved his opinion.|$|R

60|$|As may be supposed, Archie, Silas and I came {{together}} immediately we gained {{the deck of}} the sloop, for there was much <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> each other, although the lads so lately from Cambridge could not tell me more concerning the doings of our people than Hiram had already done.|$|R
60|$|Guest {{told his}} first, I followed, Adèle told hers, and Monsieur Bardow rapidly filled in certain blanks. All the while Staunton listened in silence. He had opened an atlas, and studied it {{carefully}} {{with a cigarette}} in his mouth, whilst Monsieur Bardow was speaking. When he <b>had</b> heard everything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> he pushed the atlas back and leaned over the table towards us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she said, [...] "that you {{may feel}} sure. There are things which <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> one another--presently--but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! ah!" [...] he said: [...] "Darkness! Tant mieux! The {{right thing}} for what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Since we do not esteem each other, it is well not to see too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Brass,' {{said the}} Notary, taking the word at this crisis, 'we {{professional}} people understand each other, and, when we choose, {{can say what}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in very few words. You advertised a runaway servant, the other day?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let us {{dispense}} with compliments. They are misplaced between us,' returned the other, waving his hand, 'and say plainly what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> You {{have asked me}} to meet you. I am here. Why do we stand face to face again?' ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I never <b>had</b> {{a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> my mother.

60|$|Through {{the tunnel}} {{that had led}} me in pursuit of them we passed, walking slowly, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well, Olfan. To-morrow morning, after <b>we</b> <b>have</b> eaten, <b>we</b> {{will talk}} with you again, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Till then, watch!" ...|$|R

60|$|Next to bread comes butter,--on which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, when we {{remember}} what butter is in civilized Europe, {{and compare it}} with what it is in America, we wonder at the forbearance and lenity of travelers in their strictures on our national commissariat.|$|E
6000|$|His {{meditation}} {{was interrupted}} by {{the click of a}} door handle, and Jessie appeared in the sunlight under the verandah.

50|$|I {{think it}} was {{deliberate}} that we were {{made to look like}} we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context. We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers and young women. I think those are really important concepts that the media never addressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am {{sure you}} do; and so do I also. And if this is so, why cannot we say each to the other that which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> My tale {{will be a very}} short one; but it will be true if it is short." ...|$|E
6000|$|That a law on {{the lines}} {{suggested}} will be made sooner or later is my belief: that it may come soon is my hope and prayer, lest <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of the Dartford warbler, and of twenty other species named in this chapter, as {{we have had to}} say of so many others that have gone ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in general, {{the history}} of Brandenburg under the Hohenzollerns has very little in it to excite a vulgar curiosity, though perhaps {{a great deal to}} {{interest}} an intelligent one.

Commonplace Dryasdust, and voluminous Stupidity, not worse here than elsewhere, play their Part.|$|E
