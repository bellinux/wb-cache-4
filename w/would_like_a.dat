Her father asked her if she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.|$|E

Kate, nearing her 42nd birthday, confides in Caroline that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby before she gets too old. Caroline takes Kate away for her birthday, though angers her by booking two single rooms. She feels excluded when Kate reminisces with an old university friend, Greg (Marcus Garvey) whom she is using as a sperm donor. The following day, Kate informs Caroline that their relationship is over, as Caroline is too old to change her ways and be comfortable with their relationship. Three months later, Caroline is dejected when William leaves for university and Lawrence declares that he wants to live with his father. She is overcome with emotion after learning that Kate is twelve weeks pregnant. She distracts herself by planning a wedding party for Alan and Celia with Gillian.

500|$|The book uses {{analogy to}} explain {{molecular}} phenomena. Although {{there is some}} criticism that the book's coverage is [...] "too comprehensive for the general reader" [...] and [...] "lacks an overarching, compelling narrative to carry readers through", reviewer Linda Geddes called it [...] "a cutting-edge, exhaustive guide to the rapidly changing, ever-more mysterious genome." [...] It is recommended for [...] "any nonspecialist who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> captivating, thorough, and up-to-date introduction... the bigger picture of our wonderful and messy genome." ...|$|E

Gruber identifies one omission: the concern that major investments in clean technology parallel those made during the Internet boom, with the attendant fear that there [...] "may be a bubble burst with clean tech".|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{positive}} reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for Sense and Sensibility, three for Pride and Prejudice, none for Mansfield Park, and seven for Emma. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. [...] They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, [...] "their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, {{for the benefit of}} women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> book for its story, its characters and moral". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.|$|E

Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company’s founder later said [...] "The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. But we want to grow this business." [...] indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US$4 million though in an interview he said [...] "I feel they gave me more than I expected". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica (Click link here: [...] ) [...] which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that [...] "Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar" [...] as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Macartney {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} a relatively fast pace for a left-arm orthodox spinner, comparable in speed to Derek Underwood. He {{was known for his}} consistent length and his well-concealed faster ball which often caught batsmen off guard. On sticky wickets, he was often incisive, and these conditions helped him take five wickets in an innings 17 times in his first-class career. He was known for his miserly attitude, often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive maidens rather than take wickets if it meant conceding runs. This extended to his off-field activities, where he was considered careful with money. On the 1926 tour of England, he and Mailey visited a hat shop that had a tradition of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads. When asked if he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> similar style to the one he received in 1921, Macartney referred to the hat on his head and replied [...] "Not on your life. I've been wearing this since you gave it to me in 1921." [...] Macartney's notorious fiscal obsessions irritated his captain Warwick Armstrong on the 1921 tour; during the trip, he would hoard all manner of goods that were given to the team as gifts.|$|E

[...] The teens of Ramsay Street warm to her eventually and with their help, Donna changes her ways and becomes accepted. The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun {{to be able to say}} and do these things you normally wouldn't".|$|E

500|$|Chris is {{extremely}} health-conscious and exercises constantly; he runs 10 miles during his lunch break alone, and considers a 15km run to be [...] "light" [...] exercise. He avoids eating red meat and fatty foods {{in favor of}} dishes like lean turkey burgers and vegetable loaf sweetened with fruit reduction, and takes a huge assortment of unusual vitamins. Chris always stays extremely well-hydrated, {{and as a result}} of his extreme exercise regimen has only 2.8% body fat, which makes him very susceptible to illness due to a weakened immune system. His ambition is to become the first human being to live 150 years. Chris always greets people with a firm handshake and direct eye contact, and to remember their names often points directly at people and repeats their names upon first meeting them. His constant desire to make everyone around him happy means Chris hates having to deliver bad news, a task he often assigns to his subordinates, usually Ben Wyatt. He often declares things to be [...] "literally" [...] the best thing he's ever seen or done, strongly emphasizing the word and pronouncing it [...] "littrally". He is very specific about his needs, giving long, drawn out requests, often making only one point per sentence; in the episode [...] "", he orders a beer by saying, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> local beer... I'd like it in a bottle... and I'd like that bottle to be cold." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
