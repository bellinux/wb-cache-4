5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

Chuck goes {{on his way to}} try to regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother’s company at her mother's request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who happens to have a 17-year-old daughter, Sage <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> anything to try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the Spectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina’s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married. In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in what looks like Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of The Spectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.|$|E

500|$|The storylines that {{involved}} Rachel received mixed commentary. Both Poniewozik and Stack appreciated the pairing of Rachel and Kurt: the former called them [...] "probably the strongest pairing" [...] {{of the episode}} due to similarities in their characterization, and the latter lauded Rachel's line [...] "I know you're lonely...but you're not alone" [...] as [...] "an incredibly powerful statement coming {{in the midst of}} all these gay youth suicides further illuminates the relevance and importance of a show like Glee." [...] Fallon said that the episode [...] "added some flavor" [...] to the relationship between Rachel and Finn, which was [...] "in danger of going stale", and Berk noted that [...] "Duets" [...] was the first time he had ever been [...] "marginally compelled" [...] by a storyline which involved the pair.

500|$|Before the character's debut, de Matteo {{described}} Angie as [...] "brassy" [...] and a [...] "liberal New Yorker," [...] {{which she}} said contrasts with the more conservative nature of the other characters.

[...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> what she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing what they need to survive, no matter what the price." [...] Within the series, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) describes Angie as blunt and tactless.|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E

2500|$|The King's College Criteria or the King's College Hospital {{criteria}} were devised in 1989 {{to determine if}} there were any early indices of poor prognosis in patients with acute liver failure. [...] Acute liver failure is defined as the onset of encephalopathy (altered mental status) or coagulopathy (altered bleeding tendencies) within 26 weeks of a patient diagnosed with liver disease. [...] Patients with hepatitis B acquired at birth, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis are included if their disease was identified within the past 26 weeks.

[...] The King's College Criteria have consistently shown excellent operating characteristics for determining prognosis in these patients.

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} task of a {{judge is}} to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the rule of law. Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as police officers and coroners, prosecutors or public procurators. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role {{of a judge}} varies between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while {{the prosecution and the}} defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de la loi ("The judge is the mouth of the law"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.|$|E
