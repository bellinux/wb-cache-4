25|$|A swift {{is a tool}} used to hold a hank of yarn {{while it}} is being wound off. It has an {{adjustable}} diameter {{so that it can}} hold hanks of many sizes, and rotates around a central rod. They are generally made out of wood or metal, however other materials may also be used. In the 18th and 19th centuries, swifts were sometimes made of whale ivory and they are now sought-after antiques. Swifts are not used very much in the textile industry, but are used more by knitters and crocheters <b>who</b> <b>buy</b> their yarn in hank form. The swift allows for easy balling, without the yarn getting tangled and knotted.|$|E
25|$|Around {{five million}} dogs are {{slaughtered}} in Vietnam every year, making {{the country the}} second biggest consumer of dog meat in the world after China, which consumes roughly 20 million. The consumption has been criticized by many in Vietnam {{and around the world}} as most of the dogs are pets stolen and killed in brutal ways. Vietnam does not have strong regulations to stop the practice. Dog thieves are rarely punished, and nor are the people <b>who</b> <b>buy</b> and sell stolen meat. Dog meat is particularly popular in the urban areas of the north, and can be found in special restaurants which specifically serve dog meat.|$|E
25|$|Scavenging of {{abandoned}} radioactive material {{has been the}} cause of several other cases of radiation exposure, mostly in developing nations, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those <b>who</b> <b>buy</b> the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its aesthetics or scrap value. Irresponsibility {{on the part of}} the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the Goiânia accident.|$|E
