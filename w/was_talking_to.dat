5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, {{he went there}} himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} {{that he thought he}} saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be {{scheduled for a}} release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E

25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
25|$|The Nocton rail {{accident}} was a rail accident that happened on 28 February 2002 after a vehicle smashed {{through a wall}} and fell onto the tracks. The driver, who was trapped in his van, <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> emergency services on his mobile phone {{when he was killed}} by a two-carriage Sprinter train (156409).

25|$|According to an {{internal}} police report leaked in 2007, Fantino, as superintendent of detectives in 1991, had ordered a wiretap of lawyer Peter Maloney a police critic and friend of Susan Eng, chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, the body overseeing the Toronto Police service. Conversations between Maloney and Eng were illegally recorded despite a court order that only the first minute of Maloney's conversations were to be monitored so as {{to determine whether the}} individual who he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> was on the list of those being investigated.|$|E

25|$|Ibrahimović {{received}} a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban {{was given to}} Ibrahimović in February 2012 in a 2–1 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimović stated in his defence that he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> himself in frustration. He won his first Scudetto with Milan after a draw against Roma. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011.|$|E
25|$|Numerous European clubs {{circled the}} soon-to-be free agent, with Real Madrid quickly {{being seen as}} his most likely destination. In January 1999, it was {{reported}} that McManaman <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Real with the player reportedly offered £60,000 a week and nearly £2million as a signing on fee. On 30 January, McManaman passed a medical and signed an official pre-contract with the club which would make him the best paid British footballer to date. He declined to pose in a Real Madrid shirt at the contract signing event, out of respect for Liverpool's fans.|$|E
25|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop {{he picked up}} a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun from the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street. To avoid {{alarming}} Tombstone's public, Virgil returned to Hafford's Saloon carrying the shotgun under his long overcoat. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.|$|E

We <b>are</b> not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> victims. We <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> successful people eager to improve their lives.” ...|$|R
25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to,</b> whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|Barrett <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> {{the second}} engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when {{the red light}} and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to {{the men in the}} boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
500|$|Following the game, the Canadians {{complained that}} Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader, the German referees {{of the match}} (the same ones who {{refereed}} a controversial Canada-Sweden game), were biased, since Canada was handed 31 minutes in penalties during the game, while the Soviets only received four minutes. Phil Esposito complained that one goal by the Soviets was directly {{the result of the}} referee dropping the puck while he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a teammate. The Canadians gave the pair the nickname of [...] "Badder and Worse." ...|$|E

During the conversation, the fake Sarkozy, speaking in English (the real Sarkozy does not speak English), talked to Palin about foreign policy, hunting, and the 2008 U.S. presidential election. After it was revealed to Palin that the call was a prank, she handed the phone {{to one of her}} assistants who told the comedy duo [...] "I have to let you go" [...] and hung up.|$|E
500|$|Cline, {{watching}} the clock nervously, attempted to call Connal back, {{only to find}} both lines busy. He waited {{as long as he}} could, then made one final, unsuccessful attempt. Unknown to Cline, Connal <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Goodman, who had agreed to [...] "slide the network", that is, start Heidi as soon as Curt Gowdy signed off from the game. Connal called the game producer, Ellis, in Oakland, to tell him the news, then called the BOC supervisor in Burbank – who, not knowing Connal, refused his order, and insisted on speaking with Goodman directly. As Goodman had disconnected to allow Connal to call Oakland, this could not be done.|$|E
