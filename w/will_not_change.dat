5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E

25|$|To change up a gear, {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> to the driver's requested gear.|$|E

25|$|Triangles are sturdy; while a {{rectangle}} can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure {{to one of}} its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, {{each of the three}} sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It {{is important to remember that}} triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan.

[...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E
