Jaffe studied ballet at the Maryland School of Ballet, the School of American Ballet, and the American Ballet Theatre (ABT) School. At age 16 she became a member of ABT II, and joined ABT's corps de ballet at age 18. Mikhail Baryshnikov, ABT's artistic director at the time, pulled Jaffe out of the corps de ballet to replace Gelsey Kirkland in a gala performance. With two days of rehearsal, Jaffe danced Pas d'Esclave at the Kennedy Center in <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Alexander Godunov, a Bolshoi Ballet star whose former partner had been Maya Plisetskaya. Jaffe remained a principal dancer <b>with</b> ABT for <b>the</b> following 22 years.|$|R
