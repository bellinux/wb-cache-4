25|$|After World War I, {{the small}} Spitz dogs {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus.

25|$|Pets {{provide their}} owners (or guardians) {{physical}} and emotional benefits. <b>Walking</b> <b>a</b> dog can supply both the human and pet with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction.

There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, and emotional goals with patients.|$|E

25|$|The {{breeding}} season for sloth bears {{varies according to}} location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year.

Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they start <b>walking</b> <b>a</b> month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother's back when she walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.|$|E
