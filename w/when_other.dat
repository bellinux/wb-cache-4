They may provide emergency cover <b>when</b> <b>other</b> units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages <b>when</b> <b>other</b> units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or <b>when</b> <b>other</b> prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Despite NeXT's limited {{commercial}} success, {{the company}} had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. Object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP, <b>when</b> <b>other</b> companies started to emulate NeXT's object-oriented system.

5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used <b>when</b> <b>other</b> drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E

5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme that is still used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names.
