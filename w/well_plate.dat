50|$|The static <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> or layer {{systems are}} the most {{traditional}} and simplest form of assays widely used for in vitro study. These assays are quite beneficial as they are quite simple and provide a very accessible testing environment for monitoring chemicals in the culture medium {{as well as in}} the cell. However the disadvantage of using these simple static <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> assays is that, they cannot represent the cellular interactions and physiologic fluid flow conditions taking place inside the body.|$|E
50|$|Vitrozm's 96 well Zoom Blot method uses an {{absorption}} plug to wick {{away the}} solution from the membranes, which are individually assembled in each well. The Zoom Plate is a disposable self-standing device, without any external vacuum or set up apparatus, which allows dot blots {{to be performed}} much easier and faster. The user never needs to handle a piece of membrane as in older methods. Zoom Blot's 96 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> format allows convenient signal detection and quantification using 96 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> reader or imaging system.|$|E

30|$|Endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase {{activity}} {{produced in}} liquid culture {{was determined by}} transferring 50 µL of supernatant containing the secreted mutants or the wild-type enzyme into 96 deep <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> filled with 200  µL of AZO-CMC (1 % w/v) diluted in 100  mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 as the substrate. The deep <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> were incubated at 50  °C and after 15  min the assays were stopped by the addiction of 625  µL of precipitant solution, prepared following the supplier protocol, and by centrifuging the deep-well plates at 3700  rpm for 30  min at 4  °C.

50|$|The IBEAs can be {{used from}} low sample numbers up to the {{standard}} 384 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> format, basically being a more advanced ELISA, keeping the current standards and protocols. The arrays {{are designed to be}} readily adaptable to standard high throughput screening systems. The IEBA technology {{can be used}} with existing bioassays protocols (particularly the bioassays on beads), and readers without the need to invest in a flow cytometer or other capital-intensive devices to read it out.|$|E
50|$|The {{stationary}} phase {{comes in the}} form of a packed syringe-shaped cartridge, a 96 <b>well</b> <b>plate,</b> a 47- or 90-mm flat disk, or a microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) device, a SPE method that uses a packed sorbent material in a liquid handling syringe. These can be mounted on its specific type of extraction manifold. The manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several SPE media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously. A typical cartridge SPE manifold can accommodate up to 24 cartridges, while a typical disk SPE manifold can accommodate 6 disks. Most SPE manifolds are equipped with a vacuum port. Application of vacuum speeds up the extraction process by pulling the liquid sample through the {{stationary phase}}. The analytes are collected in sample tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary phase.|$|E
5000|$|Commercially {{available}} diagnostic kits {{are also}} available. One such kit is the [...] "Trupoint" [...] diagnostic assay from PerkinElmer, Inc. This assay is a time-resolved fluorescence quenching assay that utilizes the PerkinEmer [...] "SignalClimb" [...] {{technology that is}} based on two labels that bind in close proximity to one another but on opposite DNA strands. One label is a fluorescent lanthanide chelate, which serves as the label that is monitored through an adequate 96/384 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> reader. The other label is an organic quencher molecule. The basis of this assay is the [...] "quenching" [...] or repressing of the lanthanide chelate signal by the organic quencher molecule when the two are in close proximity - as they would be when the DNA duplex is in its native state. Upon helicase activity on the duplex, the quencher and lanthanide labels get separated as the DNA is unwound. This loss in proximity negates the quenchers ability to repress the lanthanide signal, causing a detectable increase in fluorescence that is representative of the amount of unwound DNA and {{can be used as a}} quantifiable measurement of helicase activity.|$|E

40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and specific enzyme inhibition assay based on alcohol oxidase (AlOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for determination of mercury Hg(II) in water samples has been presented. This {{article describes the}} {{optimization and miniaturization of}} an enzymatic assay using a chemiluminescence reaction. The analytical performance and detection limit for determination of Hg(II) was optimized in 96 <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> and further extended to 384 <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> with a 10 -fold reduction in assay volume. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by dissolved Hg(II) was found to be linear in the range 5 – 500 pg. mL− 1 with 3 % CVin inter-batch assay. Due to miniaturization of assay in 384 <b>well</b> <b>plates,</b> Hg(II) was measurable as low as 1 pg. mL− 1 within 15 min. About 10 -fold more specificity of the developed assay for Hg(II) analysis was confirmed by challenging with interfering divalent metal ions such as cadmium Cd(II) and lead Pb(II). Using the proposed assay we could successfully demonstrate that in a composite mixture of Hg(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II), inhibition by each metal ion is significantly enhanced {{in the presence of the}} others. Applicability of the proposed assay for the determination of the Hg(II) in spiked drinking and sea water resulted in recoveries ranging from 100 – 110. 52 %...|$|R

40|$|Cytotoxicity {{assessment}} of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was performed using MTT-based microfluidic image cytometry (µFIC). The LC 50 value of HeLa cells exposed to AgNPs in the microfluidic device was estimated as 46. 7 mg/L, {{which is similar}} to that estimated by MTT-based IC for cells cultured in a 96 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> (49. 9 mg/ L). These results confirm that the µFIC approach can produce cytotoxicity data that is reasonably well-matched with that of the conventional 96 <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> system with much higher efficiency. This µFIC method provides many benefits including ease of use and low cost, and is a more rapid in vitro cell based assay for AgNPs.

40|$|Microfluidic {{devices have}} become {{invaluable}} tools {{in recent years}} to model biological phenomena. Here, the authors present a <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> microfluidic (WPM) device for conducting cell biology assays under shear flow. Physiological shear flow condi-tions of cell-cell and cell-ligand adhesion within this device produce results with higher biological significance than conven-tional well plates. The WPM format also produced significant work flow advantages such as faster liquid handling compared to static <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> assays. The authors used the VLA- 4 –VCAM- 1 cell adhesion model as the basis for a rapid, higher throughput adhesion inhibition screen of monoclonal antibodies against VLA- 4. Using the WPM device, they generated IC 50 dose-response curves 96 times faster than conventional flow cells. The WPM device was also used to study transmigration of mononuclear cells through endothelial cell monolayers. Twenty-four channels of transmigration data were generated in a single experiment.

40|$|Despite many {{advances}} in the generation of high producing recombinant mammalian cell lines {{over the last few}} decades, cell line selection and development is often slowed by the inability to predict a cell line's phenotypic characteristics (e. g. growth or recombinant protein productivity) at larger scale (large volume bioreactors) using data from early cell line construction at small culture scale. Here we describe the development of an intact cell MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry fingerprinting method for mammalian cells early in the cell line construction process whereby the resulting mass spectrometry data are used to predict the phenotype of mammalian cell lines at larger culture scale using a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model. Using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, a library of mass spectrometry fingerprints was generated for individual cell lines at the 96 deep <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> stage of cell line development. The growth and productivity of these cell lines were evaluated in a 10 L bioreactor model of Lonza's large-scale (up to 20, 000 L) fed-batch cell culture processes. Using the mass spectrometry information at the 96 deep <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> stage and phenotype information at the 10 L bioreactor scale a PLS-DA model was developed to predict the productivity of unknown cell lines at the 10 L scale based upon their MALDI-ToF fingerprint at the 96 deep <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> scale. This approach provides the basis for the very early prediction of cell lines' performance in cGMP manufacturing-scale bioreactors and the foundation for methods and models for predicting other mammalian cell phenotypes from rapid, intact-cell mass spectrometry based measurements...|$|E
