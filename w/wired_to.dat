5|$|The {{commercial}} energy supplier for {{electricity and gas}} is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure {{is the presence of}} a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> the local sub-grid. It has the potential to produce 3.5million units of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes.|$|E
5|$|Baalham {{arrived on}} October 3, {{following}} a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief {{letter to the}} American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's Newfoundlander, while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a telegraph service, these reports {{had to be taken}} by the steamer Merlin to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they could be <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> New York. Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to Sydney, Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11.|$|E

50|$|Looking back {{five years}} after the bill was passed, the Consumers Union {{reported}} that <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> competition, the reason that sold the bill, had not succeeded as legislators had hoped. CLECs had captured just under seven percent of total lines in the country, and only three percent of homes and small businesses. <b>Wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> competition accounted for only one percent of total lines nationwide.|$|R
5000|$|A strain {{insulator}} is an electrical insulator {{that is designed}} to work in mechanical tension (strain), to withstand the pull of a suspended electrical wire or cable. They are used in overhead electrical <b>wiring,</b> <b>to</b> support radio antennas and overhead power lines. A {{strain insulator}} may be inserted between two lengths of <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> isolate them electrically from each other while maintaining a mechanical connection, or where a <b>wire</b> attaches <b>to</b> a pole or tower, to transmit the pull of the <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> the support while insulating it electrically. Strain insulators were first used in telegraph systems in the mid 19th century.|$|R

It was directed by Bayley Silleck, who was nominated for an Academy Award for documentary short subject in 1996 for Cosmic Voyage.|$|E
25|$|Linen shirts had deep cuffs. Shirt sleeves became fuller {{throughout}} the period. To the 1620s, a collar <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> stick out horizontally, called a whisk, was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular falling band {{lying on the}} shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.|$|E
25|$|The bombe was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{device that}} replicated {{the action of}} several Enigma machines wired together. A standard German Enigma employed, at any one time, a set of three rotors, each {{of which could be}} set in any of 26 positions. The standard British bombe contained 36 Enigma equivalents, each with three drums <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> produce the same scrambling effect as the Enigma rotors. A bombe could run two or three jobs simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|Cantrell {{has been}} most famously seen playing a G Guitars' Rampage model. The two models most closely {{identified}} with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s. They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony fingerboard. The bridge is a Kahler Tremolo {{as opposed to a}} Floyd Rose tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s. The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> a volume pickup.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, John McClane ejects {{from the}} cockpit of a {{grounded}} Fairchild C-123 Provider for a parachute recovery just before terrorists destroy it.

Actual pyrotechnics work was done at Indian Dunes, California, with actor Bruce Willis' ejection composited into the shot later.|$|E

The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper, and it would even strike Justice J. Raymond Paris at Reyat's 1991 trial as an odd use for a timer.|$|E
25|$|On some models, {{cornering}} lamps provide white steady-intensity light for lateral illumination {{in the direction}} of an intended turn or lane change. They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals, and they may be <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> also illuminate when the vehicle is shifted into reverse gear,. Some modern vehicles activate the cornering lamp on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction, regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated.|$|E
25|$|The first {{computer}} keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is <b>wired</b> <b>to</b> its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
