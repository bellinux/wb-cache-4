5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a <b>wrongful</b> <b>death</b> claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today.

50|$|One of {{the first}} accusations of {{genocide}} submitted to the UN after the Convention entered into force concerned treatment of Black Americans.

Leaders from the Black community, including William Patterson, Paul Robeson, and W. E. B. DuBois presented this petition to the UN in December 1951. However, this accusation was a domestic political act by the Civil Rights Congress, without any reservations that a formal charge would be levied against the U.S.|$|R
40|$|When Paladin Enterprises {{published}} Hit Man, {{a manual}} about murder for hire, it knew and intended {{that the book}} {{would be used for}} such a purpose. When James Perry used the information contained in Hit Man to murder three innocent persons, he started a legal debate about the scope of First Amendment protections for books that instruct how to commit criminal acts. Many scholars and commentators indicated that Brandenburg v. Ohio contains the applicable constitutional standard; however, in litigation against Paladin, the survivors of the decedents challenged the conventional wisdom. This Note examines the Brandenburg test for its applicability to published materials that function as instruction manuals to perpetrate crimes. Because Brandenburg is inextricably linked with the crowd context, it is inapplicable to the published materials that function not as advocacy, but as instruction. Because Hit Man was used exactly as Paladin had intended, Paladin should be held liable in tort for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>deaths</b> of Perry 2 ̆ 7 s three victims...|$|R

He allows Li Kui to imbibe the poisoned wine until he is half drunk, only then did he reveal that the wine is poisoned.
