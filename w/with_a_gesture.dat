25|$|Byron would pleasantly {{pretend that}} Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy-moozy; {{and in the}} {{extraordinary}} combination of lightness, haste, indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word from his lips, accompanied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> to correspond, he would really set before you the admirable singer {{in one of his}} (then) characteristic passages of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.|$|E
25|$|The gesture is omnipresent in David's painting, from St. Roch Interceding {{with the}} Virgin for the Plague Stricken to Mars {{disarmed}} by Venus and the Graces. The raised {{hands of the}} Oath of the Horatii, the Tennis Court Oath or The Distribution of the Eagles are rhetorical devices making pleading manifest in the paintings. In The Death of Socrates, the philosopher—on the point of drinking hemlock—continues teaching his disciples <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of reprimand at their emotional displays. In Napoleon Crossing the Alps, the gesture leaves no doubt as {{to the will of}} the commander to arrive to his goal. It does not indicate the summit, but rather shows the observer the inevitability of victory {{and at the same time}} orders his soldiers to follow. The bare rather than gloved hand may indicate Napoleon desiring to appear as a peacemaker rather than a conqueror.|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld {{writes that}} Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as [...] "morally {{superior}} to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions." [...] In contrast, [...] "Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim." [...] In Adler's own words, [...] "Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he {{goes so far as}} to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock I have tried to show." [...] The road from this to method acting is clear.|$|E
60|$|With these words, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hasty <b>gesture</b> fraught <b>with</b> timid caution--such <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> had Clennam's eyes been {{familiar}} {{with in the}} old time--poor Flora left herself at eighteen years of age, a long long way behind again; {{and came to a}} full stop at last.|$|R

500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know what I say to those people?" [...] and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture,</b> cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.|$|E
500|$|Lynette Porter, in {{her book}} Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television {{observed}} that Rose's role [...] "humanizes the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience". In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to [...] "again be the Doctor’s equal" [...] and [...] "to finally match him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever". Davies describes Rose {{in the context of}} this scene, and the whole of the first series, as being [...] "braver than brave and more loyal than anyone else in the universe". The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that [...] "he gives his life for her". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script.|$|E
2500|$|The park grows noisy: the Celestes and the Soldier {{argue over}} their {{respective}} breakups while Jules and Frieda sneak away {{to have a}} tryst. Louise informs Yvonne of her father's infidelity and a fight breaks out among Jules, Yvonne, Franz, and Frieda. The Celestes and the Soldier squabble noisily, and soon all the park-goers are fighting until the Old Lady shouts, [...] "Remember, George!", and he stops them all <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture.</b> George takes control of the subjects of his painting, who sing in harmony as he transforms them into the final tableau of his finished painting ("Sunday").|$|E

2500|$|Under Augustus' rule, {{the demand}} for gladiators began to exceed supply, and matches sine missione were officially banned; an economical, pragmatic {{development}} that happened to match popular notions of [...] "natural justice". When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered. In general, gladiators who fought well were likely to survive. At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories. In any event, the final decision of death or life belonged to the editor, who signalled his choice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> described by Roman sources as pollice verso meaning [...] "with a turned thumb"; a description too imprecise for reconstruction of the gesture or its symbolism. Not all editors chose {{to go with the}} crowd, and not all those condemned to death for putting on a poor show chose to submit: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, Georges Seurat, {{known as}} George in the musical, is {{sketching}} studies for his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. He announces to the audience: [...] "White, a blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring {{order to the}} whole, through design, composition, tension, balance, light and harmony." [...] He conjures up the painting's setting, a small suburban park on an island, and retains some control of his surroundings as he draws them. His longtime mistress, Dot, models for him, despite her frustration at having {{to get up early}} on a Sunday ("Sunday in the Park with George"). More park regulars begin to arrive: a quarrelsome Old Lady and her Nurse discuss how Paris is changing to accommodate a tower for the International Exposition, but the Nurse is more interested in a German coachman, Franz. The quiet of the park is interrupted by a group of rude bathers. George freezes them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture,</b> making them the subjects of his first painting, Bathers at Asnières. The setting abruptly changes to a gallery where the painting is on display. Jules (a more successful artist friend of George's) and his wife Yvonne think George's work has [...] "No Life." [...] Back on the island, Jules and Yvonne have a short discussion with George and depart. They take their coachman Franz with them, interrupting his rendezvous with the Nurse. Dot, who has grown tired of standing still in the early morning sunlight, leaves the park mollified after George promises {{to take her to the}} Follies. George approaches the Old Lady, revealed to be his mother, and asks to draw her, but she bluntly refuses.|$|E
