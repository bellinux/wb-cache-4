The Newburgh Raid on July 18, 1862, occurred when Confederate officer Adam Johnson briefly captured Newburgh by convincing the Union troops garrisoning the town that he had cannon on the surrounding hills, <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> were merely camouflaged stovepipes.

5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The crescent is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red is a symbol of resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>they</b> may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} issue with martial arts therapy in a psychological context is {{the distinction between}} a therapeutic approach and a martial approach to the lessons. With the evolution of martial arts into combat systems (Krav Maga) and combat sports (Kickboxing, Submission Wrestling, Mixed martial arts), many instructors and organizations teach only martial/combative techniques with little (if any) attention to philosophical, spiritual or societal issues. In other words, students may only be taught how to fight without lessons in the proper context for applying these techniques, something that is emphasized in more traditional martial art curricula. Hypothetically, if these philosophical/societal teachings {{were one of the}} specific therapeutic factors in martial arts study, studying an art without these teachings would be of little therapeutic benefit, and arguably detrimental to psychological health (Reynes, 2002). Additionally, if not properly informed, a patient undergoing martial arts therapy may erroneously believe they are acquiring martial proficiency <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> the curriculum <b>they</b> are learning is unsuitable for self-defense or competitive needs.|$|R
40|$|Computational Grids {{have the}} {{potential}} to become the main execution platform for high performance and distributed applications. However, such systems are extremely complex and prone to failures. In this paper, we present a survey with the grid community on which several people shared their actual experience regarding fault treatment. The survey reveals that, nowadays, users have to be highly involved in diagnosing failures, that most failures are due to configuration problems (a hint of the area’s immaturity), and that solutions for dealing with failures are mainly application-dependent. Going further, we identify two main reasons for this state of affairs. First, grid components that provide high-level abstractions when working, do expose all gory details when broken. Since there are no appropriate mechanisms to deal with the complexity exposed (configuration, middleware, hardware and software issues), users need to be deeply involved in the diagnosis and correction of failures, <b>when,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> all <b>they</b> want is to run their applications. One needs a way to coordinate different support teams working at the grids different levels of abstraction. Second, fault tolerance schemes today implemented on grids tolerate only crash failures. Since grids are prone to more complex failures, such as heisenbugs, one needs to tolerate tougher failures. Our hope is that the very heterogeneity, that makes a grid a complex environment, can help in the creation of diverse software replicas, a strategy that can tolerate more complex failures. ...|$|R
2500|$|The philosopher Karl Popper {{held that}} any {{scientific}} proposition must be falsifiable, {{in other words}} it must at least be possible to imagine an experiment whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis. Initially he thought that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (often summarized as [...] "the survival of the fittest") was untestable in this sense, and therefore [...] "almost tautological." [...] Popper later changed his view, concluding that the theory of natural selection is falsifiable and that Darwin's own example of the peacock's tail had disproved one extreme variation of it, that all evolution is driven by natural selection. Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically {{to the theory of}} natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that [...] "Darwinism" [...] or [...] "Darwin's theory of evolution" [...] was a [...] "metaphysical research programme" [...] because it was not falsifiable. <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on population genetics, the study of the relative frequencies of alleles (different forms of the same gene). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled Lamarckianism or saltationism, evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms. In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that [...] "historical sciences" [...] such as paleontology or the history of evolution of life on Earth were not genuine sciences, <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> he believed <b>they</b> could make falsifiable predictions.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the security {{architecture of the}} Ara mobile agent platform, after reviewing the relevant aspects of comparable systems. The Ara model features few principals, a simple authentication and encryption API, and a simple but highly customizable authorization scheme. One system may contain many virtual places, each establishing a domain of logically related services under a common security policy governing all agents at this place. Agents are equipped with allowances limiting their resource accesses, both globally per agent lifetime and locally per place. Various aspects of the implementation of this model are discussed, and finally the situation and limitations of Ara and other systems are summarized. 1. The Situation of Mobile Agent Security Security is often seen as the primary technical requirement for widespread adoption of mobile agent technology. Indeed mobile agents raise exceptional security problems; this appears quite consequential <b>when</b> reasoning that <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> combine the security problems of traditional large scale distributed systems and multi-user operating systems: As in distributed systems, there are multiple principals with mutual mistrust between them, there is generally no common trusted computing base, the set of principals is large and dynamic, and the principals are not well known to each other. As in operating systems, applications execute with full access to the host system’s API, consuming the host’s resources, and sharing resources with unrelated applications. For mobile agents travelling to and executing on a foreign host, all these hold in combination, and many security concepts from either area are no longer applicable without modification. Accordingly, classic security threats such as spying, impersonation, denial of service, and plain damage must be reconsidered in mobile agent systems under aggravated conditions. In addition, specific new security problems are introduced by mobile programs themselves: The application (i. e. the agent) no longer trusts the host system it is running on, as an agen...|$|R

Thus claims based on ideal-solution counts can mislead readers into thinking techniques will provide superior final results, <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the opposite is true. ...|$|R
6000|$|In my {{judgment}} {{the intervention of}} the State in the affairs of the medical profession can be justified not upon any pretence of protecting the public, and still less upon that of protecting the medical profession, but simply and solely upon the fact that the State employs medical men for certain purposes, and, as employer, has a right to define the conditions on which it will accept service. It is for the interest of the community that no person shall die without there being some official recognition of the cause of his death. It is a matter of the highest importance to the community that, in civil and criminal cases, the law shall be able to have recourse to persons whose evidence may be taken as that of experts; and it will not be doubted that the State has a right to dictate the conditions under which it will appoint persons to the vast number of naval, military, and civil medical offices held directly or indirectly under the Government. Here, and here only, it appears to me, lies the justification for {{the intervention of the}} State in medical affairs. It says, or, in {{my judgment}}, should say, to the public, [...] "Practice medicine if you like--go to be practised upon by anybody;" [...] and to the medical practitioner, [...] "Have a qualification, or do not have a qualification if people don't mind it; but if the State is to receive your certificate of death, if the State is to take your evidence as that of an expert, if the State is to give you any kind of civil, or military, or naval appointment, then we can call upon you to comply with our conditions, and to produce evidence that you are, in our sense of the word, qualified. Without that we will not place you in that position." [...] As a matter of fact, that is the relation of the State to the medical profession in this country. For my part, I think it an extremely healthy relation; and it is one that I should be very sorry to see altered, except in so far that it would certainly be better if greater facilities were given for the swift and sharp punishment of those who profess to have the State qualification <b>when,</b> <b>in</b> point of <b>fact,</b> <b>they</b> do not possess it.

25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>they</b> had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|E
