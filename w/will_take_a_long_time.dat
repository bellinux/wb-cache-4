The first to be created was the deep sea waters (waters of the underworld); the second was air including the high heavens (Kuul na, in Serer) such as the sun, the moon and the stars; and third was earth. However, the Earth was not one of the first primordial worlds to be formed. It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before the waters and the Earth were separated.|$|E
25|$|The King {{is usually}} {{protected}} by hiding it behind a {{wall on the}} 2nd rank built from the two Tigers and the Elephant. When standing shoulder to shoulder these pieces protect each other's blind spots, making the defense hold up against a lone Lion. An even stronger castle results from leaving the Golds diagonally protecting the outer-most pieces of the wall, although this has the obvious disadvantage that these Golds then cannot be used for attacking, or protecting the wings of your camp from infestation by enemy promoting pieces. There is no hurry in building the castle, as it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before the opponent can fight his way through all the material that is initially {{in front of your}} King.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the course}} of his career, some of Galtung {{statements}} and views have drawn criticism, most notably his criticism of western countries during and after the Cold War and what his critics perceived as a positive attitude to the Soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China. A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post criticised some of Galtung's statements. Both authors criticized Galtung's opinion that while Communist China was [...] "repressive in a certain liberal sense", Mao Zedong was [...] "endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood" [...] because China showed that [...] "the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'—and it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before the West will be willing to view China as a master teacher in such subjects." [...] The authors also criticized Galtung's opposition to Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956 and his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as [...] "persecuted elite personages".|$|E
2500|$|On 15 June 2012 TEPCO {{reported}} that a robot that was sent into the No. 2 reactor building on 13 June 2012 to take video images and radiation measurements, detected a reading of 880mSv (millisieverts) per hour of radiation on the fifth floor, which one floor (4.5 meters) directly above the reactor containment vessel. [...] TEPCO suspects that during initial accident in March 2011, that radioactive substances leaked from the No. 2 reactor moved through the building, but after analyzing the images taken by the robot it {{could not find the}} exact route the radioactive substances traveled, and images taken by the robot found no major damage on the fifth floor. During the March 2011 nuclear accident the No. 2 reactor is believed to have released the largest amount of radioactive substances. But the overall route the radioactive material traveled has yet to be determined. TEPCO needs to find and repair the damaged parts of the reactor to recover melted nuclear fuel before TEPCO can begin the process of decommissioning the reactor. [...] However high radiation often stops workers from entering the building. This scenario means it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to find the problems in the containment vessel.|$|E
