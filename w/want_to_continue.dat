Bottomley also indicated {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> playing.|$|E
5|$|Between 1967 and 1970, Bob Dylan {{recorded}} and released {{a series of}} albums that incorporated country rock elements. All were produced by Bob Johnston. During the sessions for the final of these, New Morning, Dylan decided {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> working with Johnston. Al Kooper did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound. Russell suggested that Dylan come with him to Blue Rock Studios in New York City to record some new material.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2004, he {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title, beating former world champion Randall Bailey by knockout {{in the sixth}} round, {{as part of the}} Vitali Klitschko-Danny Williams undercard in Las Vegas. Cotto's performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in his face that opened cuts over and under both of his eyes. As a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004 the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico's fighter of the year for 2004.|$|E

5|$|The Partisan Prohibitions were {{repealed}} {{during the}} Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, {{largely because the}} court did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to alienate {{a significant portion of the}} gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts & Vinter, an {{established}} publisher, {{heard from the}} printer of Science Fantasy and New Worlds that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: Science Fantasy and New Worlds both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who {{was a friend of}} Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.|$|E

25|$|The {{motivation}} for the withdrawal of co-proxamol was the reduction in suicides and {{a key part of}} the agency's justification of its decision was based upon studies showing co-proxamol was no more effective than paracetamol alone in pain management.

25|$|In 1966 the Taoiseach Seán Lemass visited Northern Ireland in secrecy, {{leading to}} a return visit to Dublin by Terence O'Neill; it had taken four decades to achieve such a simple meeting.

25|$|Bocskai {{married a}} wealthy widow, Margit Hagymássy, in late 1583. Her dowry {{included}} the fortress of Nagykereki {{and the nearby}} villages. Stephen Báthory dissolved the regency council and appointed Ghyczy to administer Transylvania on Sigismund's behalf in May 1585. Bocskai retained his seat in the royal council. After Stephen Báthory died in December 1586, Bocskai went at least twice to Poland to negotiate the implementation of Báthory's last will. During his visits, he realized that most Polish noblemen did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> Báthory's policy and Transylvania could no longer expect support from Poland.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War era {{also showed}} {{a spirit of}} sexual revolution. The anarchist women's {{organization}} Mujeres Libres established an equal opportunity for women {{in a society that}} traditionally had held women in lower regard. Women acquired power they had not previously had in Spanish society, fighting at the front and doing heavy jobs, things that had been forbidden to them until then. Free love became popular, although some parents' distrust produced the creation of the revolutionary weddings, informal ceremonies in which the couples declared their status, and that could be annulled if both parties didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure is simple {{both for the}} surgeon, involving very few risks for the experienced ear surgeon. For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported. Patients may experience numbness of {{the area around the}} implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure. This often disappears after some time. There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery. One important feature of the Baha is that, if a patient for whatever reason does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> with the arrangement, it takes the surgeon less than a minute to remove it. The Baha does not restrict the wearer from any activities such as outdoor life, sporting activities etc.|$|E
