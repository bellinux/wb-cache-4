2500|$|On March 10, 2011, {{during a}} segment on 2012 presidential {{contender}} Tim Pawlenty's {{political action committee}} (PAC), Colbert announced the formation of his own PAC [...] and hosted former FEC Chairman Trevor Potter on the program to help him fill out the paperwork. [...] Troubled {{by the fact that}} large corporations were not donating to his SuperPAC, [...] Potter explained that corporations prefer to support political causes when the corporations can remain anonymous. [...] Therefore, he helped Colbert set up a 501(c)(4) Delaware Shell corporation in which donations can be given anonymously without limit and used for political purposes. Colbert asked what the difference was between that and money laundering. [...] Potter answered, [...] "It's hard to say." [...] On November 12, Colbert shut down his Super PAC, citing the death of his fictional advisor Ham Rove. [...] Potter advised him that by making a check with the remaining funds out to his 501(c)(4), with an [...] "Agency Letter" [...] telling it to transfer that money to a second anonymous 501(c)(4), he would not have to tell anyone - even the IRS - <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> money.|$|E

If we had had the luck to drop into one of the upper valleys without being noticed we could have hunted and trapped there and looked for gold for months without much chance of being discovered, but this has upset it all. I am afraid that what the chief says is true. If we keep together we starve, if we break up and hunt we shall be ambushed and killed. I hate giving up anything I have set my mind on, but this time I don't see a way out of it. We ain't the first party that has come up here and had to go back again with empty hands, and we know <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> party of twenty old-time miners from California two years ago, though none of them ever got back to tell the tale.

But <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> footprint when nuclear accidents are included? Adding the land impacts of the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents doubles nuclear's km 2 /GWh footprint, though it remains slightly less land-intensive than other energy sources. However, one more accident will put it on par with solar, and the long-term trend favors renewables. ...|$|R
5000|$|Two music videos, {{both with}} {{elements}} of Northern soul dancing, {{have been released}} for [...] "Love Me Again". One version directed by Vaughan Arnell {{is based on the}} classic love story of Romeo and Juliet. The woman in the video, Juliet, is British actress Margaux Billard. The Romeo, is British model Tommy-Lee Winkworth. This video ends in a cliffhanger as they get run over by a truck, but <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was unclear. This was solved in the video for Newman's next song [...] "Cheating", which started with a newspaper article indicating that they had indeed survived the crash, which was a hit and run accident.|$|R
6000|$|For <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> same Mount Vesuvius nearly 1800 years ago, {{in the old}} Roman times? For {{ages and}} ages it had been lying quiet, like any other hill. Beautiful cities were built at its foot, filled with people who were as handsome, and as comfortable, and (I am afraid) as wicked, as people ever were on earth. Fair gardens, vineyards, olive-yards, covered the {{mountain}} slopes. It was held {{to be one of}} the Paradises of the world. As for the mountain's being a burning mountain, who ever thought of that? To be sure, on the top of it was a great round crater, or cup, a mile or more across, and a few hundred yards deep. But that was all overgrown with bushes and wild vines, full of boars and deer. What sign of fire was there in that? To be sure, also, there was an ugly place below by the sea-shore, called the Phlegraen fields, where smoke and brimstone came out of the ground, and a lake called Avernus over which poisonous gases hung, and which (old stories told) was one of the mouths of the Nether Pit. But what of that? It had never harmed any one, and how could it harm them? ...|$|E

40|$|The {{generalized}} Rosenblatt {{process is}} obtained by replacing the single critical exponent characterizing the Rosenblatt process by two different exponents {{living in the}} interior of a triangular region. <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> generalized Rosenblatt process as these critical exponents approach the boundaries of the triangle? We show by two different methods that on each of the two symmetric boundaries, the limit is non-Gaussian. On the third boundary, the limit is Brownian motion. The rates of convergence to these boundaries are also given. The situation is particularly delicate as one approaches the corners of the triangle, because the limit process will depend on how these corners are approached. All limits are in the sense of weak convergence in C[0, 1]. These limits cannot be strengthened to convergence in L^ 2 (Ω). Comment: 37 pages. To appear in The Annals of Probabilit...|$|R

50|$|Hanna van Recklinghausen is {{last heard}} of in 1349.

It is unknown if Hanna van Recklinghausen {{was a part of}} that group, and it is also unknown <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> group, if it was placed under the duke's protection or killed.

And the personification of the energy that gives birth to forms and nourishes forms is properly female. It is in the agricultural world of ancient Mesopotamia, the Egyptian Nile, and in the earlier planting-culture systems that the Goddess is the dominant mythic form.|$|E
