40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the phrase “cultural robotics ” {{to refer to}} the interdisciplinary analysis of autonomous machines and their mutual construction with society: as culture constructs robots, they are (re) constructing us. The objects we study range from industrial manufacturing devices to socially-intelligent robots (SIRs), and our disciplinary frameworks include humanities-oriented approaches –cultural anthropology and graphic design in particular—as well as cybernetics and computational sciences. We will examine the cultural significance of two SIRs portrayed in pop culture, analyze the socio-technical history of autonomous devices such as the master-slave circuit, and explore the ways in which such observations might contribute to efforts such as participatory design (discussed here in terms of Bennett’s “interactive aesthetics”). We conclude with a recent case study in which racial identity and robot design had direct intersections. Like Haraway and Latour, <b>we</b> <b>ai...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Meta-analysis {{is a vital}} {{task for}} {{systematically}} summarizing statisti-cal results from clinical trials that are carried out to compare the effect of one medication (or other treatment) against another. Currently, most meta-analysis activities are done by manually pooling data. This is a very time consuming and expensive task. An automated or even semi-automated tool that can support some of the processes underlying meta-analysis is greatly needed. Furthermore, statis-tical results from clinical trials are usually represented as sampling distributions (i. e., with the mean value and the SEM). When collecting statistical information from reports on clinical trials, not all reports contain full statistical information (i. e., some do not provide SEMs) whilst traditional meta-analysis excludes trials reports that contain incomplete information, which inevitably ignores many trials that could be valuable. Furthermore, some trials results can be significantly incon-sistent {{with the rest of}} trials that address the same problem. Therefore, highlight-ing (resp. removing) such inconsistencies is also very important to reveal (resp. reduce) any potential flaws in some of the trials results.

40|$|There is a {{well-established}} geographical gradient in cardio-vascular mortality in Great Britain (GB) {{with the highest}} rates in Scotland and the lowest rates in the south. 1 Studies of migration within GB {{have been used to}} investigate the relative contribution of circumstances in childhood and adult life to cardiovascular disease risk. 2 The logic in these studies is that if the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people migrating from a low incidence to a high incidence area increases with time, or the risk among people migrating from a high incidence area to one of low incidence decreases with time, it is likely that factors acting in later life are of key importance. If the migrants retain the risk of their area of origin, it is likely that genetic or early life factors exert the major influence. However, previous studies of migrants within GB have pro-duced conflicting results. 2 – 4 In an earlier report from the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) the geographical area of adult residence appeared to be of greater importance in determining the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence than place of birth, 2 whereas a national study of proportional mortality ratios in England and Wales suggested a significant influence from birthplace for deaths from CHD and stroke. 3 In a later study of migrants within England and Wales, mortality rates from CHD were found to be related in almost equal measures to region of origin and to region of residence in later life. 4 The conclusion from the earlier BRHS report was based on 8 years follow-up and relatively few cardiovascular events, and none of these three internal migration studies assessed the role of social class or individual adult lifestyle factors on the findings observed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the role of early life environment and adult life factors in determining the risk of cardiovascular disease, a subject of current debate. 5 <b>We</b> <b>ai...</b>|$|E

40|$|Text is now, {{and will}} remain, an {{essential}} embodiment of information. It {{is a logical}} error, not a practical folly, to suppose that in general we can replace a mass of text by an equivalent AI-type propositional knowledge base with accompanying inference engine for search: getting information mostly, because properly, means seeing what someone has said about something. What, therefore, could AI (and especially NLP) techniques contribute to text-based in-formation handling? Specifically, would they be for searching, or for indexing?

40|$|In this lecture, {{we develop}} {{the notion of}} “adaptive {{learning}} ” as proposed by Milgrom and Roberts [1]. Although the learning definition they give is of interest in its own right, it primarily derives power {{in the case of}} dominance solvable games, or for games where there is a straightforward characterization of the set of strategies surviving iterated strict dominance (hereafter ISD). Throughout the lecture we consider a finite N-player game, where each player i has a finite pure action set Ai; let A = ∏ i <b>Ai.</b> <b>We</b> let <b>ai</b> denote a pure action for player i, and let si ∈ ∆(Ai) denote a mixed action for player i. We will typically view si as a vector in R Ai, with si(ai) equal to the probability that player i places on <b>ai.</b> <b>We</b> let Πi(a) denote the payoff to player i when the composite pure action vector is a, and by an abuse of notation also let Πi(s) denote the expected payoff to player i when the composite mixed action vector is s. We let BRi(s−i) denote the best response mapping of player i; here s−i is the composite mixed action vector of players other than i. We will need some additional notation involving ISD. Given T ⊂ ∏ i <b>Ai,</b> <b>we</b> define Ui(T) as follows: Ui(T) = {ai ∈ Ai: for all si ∈ ∆(Ai), there exists a−i ∈ T−i s. t. Πi(ai,a−i) ≥ Πi(si,a−i) }. Here T−i = ∏ j=i Tj, where Tj is the projection of T onto Aj. In other words, Ui(T) is the set of pure strategies of player i that are not dominated by any mixed strategy, given that all other players play using action vectors in T−i. We let U(T) = ∏ i Ui(T). We also use Uk (T) to denote the set of pure strategies remaining after k applications of U to the set T, with U 0 equal to the identity map.

30|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} of the methodology and sampling protocol {{can be found in}} both Lozano et al. (2003) and Virgós et al. (2003). Briefly, each of the 39 survey locations consisted of a 1 -km transect (along a path) where we recorded both wildcat scats and rabbit latrines (39 1 -km transects in total). Each 1 -km transect was sampled once per period of time, and transects in the repeated survey (period 2) were the same to allow for comparisons. At each survey location (i.e., a 1 -km transect), <b>we</b> calculated an <b>AI</b> for wildcats based on the frequency of occurrence of scats. Scats are left by wildcats along trails as territorial marks, thus indicating the presence of resident individuals (Corbett 1979; Lozano et al. 2003; Barja and Bárcena 2005; Piñeiro and Barja 2012). In most cases, scats found on the same trail belonged to different individuals (Piñeiro 2012; Piñeiro et al. 2012), which precluded multiple sampling of individuals. <b>We</b> calculated the <b>AI</b> by dividing the number of 200 -m segments where wildcat scat (or a small accumulation of scats likely belonging to the same individual) was found, by five (the total number of segments in each transect). For wild rabbits, <b>we</b> obtained the <b>AI</b> by recording the number of latrines found on transects 50 m long and 2 m wide conducted 200 m perpendicular to the principal transect on the trail (see also Virgós et al. 2003).|$|R
