5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out.</b> <b>In</b> the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Further {{successful}} defenses followed against Torres on the January 30, 2012, {{episode of}} Raw and Tamina Snuka at Elimination Chamber on February 19. After this, Phoenix competed only sporadically {{for a few}} months, including a tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, where she and Eve Torres were defeated by Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix lost to Nikki Bella in a non-title match, following Kelly's interference. On the April 23 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost her Divas Championship to Nikki Bella in a Lumberjill match, after suffering a storyline ankle injury. At Extreme Rules, Phoenix was scheduled to face Nikki in a rematch for the Divas Championship, however she was not medically cleared to compete {{and was replaced by}} the returning Layla, who ended up winning the title. Phoenix made two unsuccessful attempts at regaining the Divas Championship from Layla at Over the Limit in May and at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> June, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In November, MNM reunited on {{an episode}} of Raw to accept an open {{challenge}} from The Hardys (Jeff and Matt Hardy) at December to Dismember, a match that they lost. MNM and the Hardys feuded across the brands throughout December, with the feud intensifying after Mercury was legitimately injured at Armageddon in a four-way ladder match. Mercury wrestled Matt on SmackDown!, while Nitro continued to feud with Jeff for the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, including a steel cage match at New Year's Revolution. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> February which ended the feud. MNM continued on and off as a team until Mercury was released from WWE in March 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, on February 6, {{they won}} the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Los Guerreros. They continued their rivalry with Benoit, facing him and Brock Lesnar at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> a handicap match, where they teamed with their mentor Angle in a losing effort. After a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, Team Angle lost the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day on May 18 in a ladder match. Shortly afterwards, on June 12, Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas about the losing streak {{they had been in}} for a couple of weeks, and, after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership, he fired them both from Team Angle. For a few weeks they wrestled against Angle, both in singles matches and in tag team matches.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the April 30 {{episode of}} Raw, {{when he refused}} {{to give in to}} Brock Lesnar's unreasonable contract demands, resulting in Lesnar attacking him and storyline breaking his arm. Upon his return two weeks later, Triple H was confronted by Lesnar's legal representative, Paul Heyman, who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract. After he accosted Heyman, Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery. At the No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> June, Triple H challenged Lesnar, who was not present, to a match at SummerSlam, which Heyman refused on Lesnar's behalf the following night on Raw. At Raw 1000, Stephanie McMahon goaded Heyman into Triple H's challenge against Lesnar. To anger Triple H, Lesnar broke Michaels's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw. Six days later at SummerSlam, Triple H lost to Lesnar after submitting to the Kimura Lock, breaking his arm again in storyline.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, London and Kendrick {{suffered}} a non-title {{loss to the}} rookie team Deuce 'n Domino. A further tag team match loss and a singles loss for Kendrick to Deuce led to a championship match at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out,</b> <b>in</b> which London and Kendrick were victorious. They retained the championship against MNM on SmackDown in March, and then retained the championship against Deuce 'n Domino again in April, after Deuce 'n Domino were disqualified. In a rematch the following week on the April 20 episode of SmackDown!, London and Kendrick lost the championship to Deuce 'n Domino. During the match London missed a moonsault from the ring apron to the floor kayfabe injuring his ribs, leaving Kendrick to battle Deuce 'n Domino alone. London and Kendrick's reign was the longest in the championship's history at 331 days until it was surpassed by The New Day in 2016. Selling his storyline injured ribs, London was absent from physical action until the May 11 episode of SmackDown, when he defeated Domino in singles competition. London and Kendrick unsuccessfully competed for the title on June 1 in a triple threat tag team match, which also involved Regal and Taylor, and lost a rematch on June 15 in a standard tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and it seemed he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off {{to act in the}} movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand {{was between}} Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy {{at the same}} event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided to challenge him at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out.</b> <b>In</b> the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would {{be added to the}} WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.|$|E

5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to fire him, Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E
