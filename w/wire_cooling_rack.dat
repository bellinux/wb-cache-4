40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMilitary electronics are frequently operated in excessively confined spaces aboard ships and aircraft. This limited space impacts significantly {{on the space}} available for cooling equipment. The optimal solution {{is the development of}} one universal, modular rack for shipboard or aviation use. with a modular design, upgrades to equipment could also be accompanied by an upgrade to the <b>cooling</b> <b>rack</b> itself with very little additional cost or difficulty. A water <b>cooled</b> avionics <b>rack</b> can provide sufficient cooling for any piece or combination of avionics equipment if enough water flow paths are used, the water is at the appropriated temperature and the water is properly distributed within the passages. To determine if the cooling medium, water, is sufficiently distributed within a modular <b>cooling</b> <b>rack,</b> an analysis of the flow and pressure distribution of the coolant is required. This thesis presents a computer code that has been developed as an initial step in the total design of a modular <b>cooling</b> <b>rack</b> for avionics equipment. It itself, the code details a specific design technique and allows for the determination of whether a proposed configuration, including source location, characteristics of the cooling water, and {{the size and shape of}} the proposed flow passages will indeed provide a proper distribution of the coolant.

50|$|Indirect Liquid cooling (ILC) {{involves}} water <b>cooled</b> <b>racks</b> with (active) {{rear door}} or in-row heat exchangers which are water cooled. The {{advantage of the}} active rear doors {{is that all the}} heat from air cooled IT is immediately absorbed by the water circuit when it leaves the rack which eliminates the need for CRACs, also in partial ILC implementations. This makes cooling systems very efficient, and supports limited efficiency on the IT itself by assisting ventilation.|$|R
50|$|A recent, and novel, form of ultra-lightweight {{actuator}} uses memory wire. As {{a current}} is applied, the wire is heated above its transition temperature and so changes shape, applying a torque to the output shaft. When power is removed, the <b>wire</b> <b>cools</b> {{and returns to}} its earlier shape.|$|R
50|$|Hot wire anemometers use a {{very fine}} wire (on the order of several micrometres) {{electrically}} heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the <b>wire</b> <b>cools</b> the <b>wire.</b> As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon {{the temperature of the}} metal (tungsten is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.|$|R
50|$|Angel food cakes {{are cooled}} upside down. Some tube pans have “feet” or “fingers” that extend {{off of the}} top rim of the pan. The “feet” are placed on a <b>cooling</b> <b>rack.</b> If the pan does not have “feet” it is {{customary}} for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube {{to ensure that the}} pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{known as}} the POWER7-IH, the Power 775 is a water <b>cooled</b> <b>rack</b> module, 34 inches wide, 54 inches deep and 3.5 inches (2U) high. Each drawer {{comprises}} up to eight nodes (single O/S images) with a MCM with four POWER7 CPUs each, and 16 DDR3 SDRAM slots per MCM {{for a total of}} 256 POWER7 cores and 2 TB RAM. Each drawer also has eight optical connect controller Hub chips, connecting neighboring MCMs, PCIe peripherals and other compute nodes. One rack can house up to a dozen Power 775 drawers for a total performance of 94 TFLOPS.|$|R
50|$|During its reconstruction, the Colonel {{had a new}} {{foundation}} poured, {{which created}} a basement. In the basement, he had ovens installed whose vents and chimney extended underground beneath Route 25 to a structure that once stood on the other side. In addition to the ovens, marble slabs and <b>cooling</b> <b>racks</b> were also installed. It is thought that at one time, the windmill basement was an operating bakery. During the flour rationing of World War I, the bakery supposedly produced bread for the Fabyan family and even for their two bears, Tom and Jerry. However, the extent of use of the mill's bakery is debatable due to an inadequate oven draft.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} the water {{infrastructure}} becomes segmented. Instead of feeding each cooling setup in a parallel infrastructure, the inlets of different technologies or {{different parts of the}} infrastructure are connected to the return circuit of another part of the infrastructure. In essence, the output of a liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>rack</b> should not be routed to a cooling installation, but to a different type of liquid cooling environment. By chaining the segmented liquid circuits in larger environments, very high return temperatures can be achieved, which enables the practical and effective reusability of thermal energy and decreases investments needed to make large scale heat reuse a viable option.|$|R
50|$|Since {{there is}} no such thing as one {{solution}} for all, any platform should be designed with the optimal technology for its different elements. Therefore, each part of a platform should be set up with a mix of optimised technologies. For example, storage environments are least suitable to be cooled directly by liquid due to the low energy production and the common dependency on moving parts. These can be set up in water <b>cooled</b> <b>racks.</b> High volumes of servers which require the least maintenance can best be positioned in a Total Liquid Cooling environment. Varying specialised server systems which require constant physical access are best situated in Direct Liquid Cooled environments.|$|R

The brand was then re-cooled for 20-30 seconds before being applied to a new frog. By using different numbers, orientations, and differentiating by sex, it is possible to create a number of combinations in order to mark large numbers of frogs.|$|R
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in raised lip around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market baking sheets found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as <b>cooling</b> <b>racks,</b> ovens, and shelving, is made to fit these standard pans.|$|R

50|$|Militarised TGS {{models have}} GVWs ranging from around 18- to 44-tonnes. Tractor trucks are {{available}} with GCWs of up to 250-tonnes. MAN turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engines are fitted across the range, with emissions options (dependant on territory) ranging from EURO 3 to EURO 5. Standard engine options for militarised TGS models are a MAN D20 rated at 440 hp or a MAN D26 rated at 480 hp. The D26 engine with rated at 540 hp is available for heavy equipment transporter applications, this including an extra <b>cooling</b> <b>rack.</b> A 16-speed ZF manual all-synchromesh gearbox is standard for the TGS range, this coupled to a MAN two-speed transfer box with selectable or permanent all-wheel drive. Axles are of the hub-reduction type, rear drive axles being single tyre specific if required. Examples with undriven front axles are also available. Suspension is by conventional leaf springs, complemented by shock-absorbers and anti-roll bars as required. Standard tyre size is 14.00 R 20, with options including 395/85R 20, 525/65R 20.5 and 12.00 R 24 twin tires for heavy equipment transporters.|$|R
50|$|The superconducting {{nanowire}} single-photon detector (SNSPD) {{is based}} on a superconducting <b>wire</b> <b>cooled</b> well below the superconducting transition temperature and biased with a dc current that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current. The SNSPD is typically made from ≈ 5 nm thick niobium nitride films which are patterned as narrow nanowires (with a typical width of 100 nm). Absorption of a photon breaks Cooper pairs and reduces the critical current below the bias current. A small non-superconducting section across the width of the nanowire is formed. This resistive non-superconducting section then leads to a detectable voltage pulse of a duration of about 1 nanosecond. The main advantages of this type of photon detector are its high speed (a maximal count rate of 2 GHz makes them the fastest available) and its low dark count rate. The main disadvantage is the lack of intrinsic energy resolution.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{increased}} density of blade-server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for <b>cooling</b> with <b>racks</b> populated at over 50% full. This {{is especially true}} with early-generation blades. In absolute terms, a fully populated rack of blade servers is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard 1U servers. This is because one can fit up to 128 blade servers in the same rack that will only hold 42 1U rack mount servers.|$|R
40|$|Eleven <b>cooling</b> {{systems for}} <b>rack</b> mounted {{computer}} equipment were evaluated and compared for their cooling effectiveness and their energy use. The cooling systems were of various designs but all were "close coupled" or "enclosed", {{and they all}} ultimately transferred heat to the building chilled water system. The types of cooling systems tested were: <b>rack</b> <b>cooler</b> with air to water heat exchanger, row type <b>rack</b> <b>cooler</b> with air to refrigerant or air to water heat exchanger, rack rear door passive cooler with air to refrigerant or air to water heat exchanger, a prototype direct touch cooling system using refrigerant, and a design consisting of a shipping container type enclosure cooled with chilled water. A number of energy-efficiency metrics and test parameters were introduced and used for comparison. The energy-efficiency metrics follow industry-standard methods with some modifications. A set of three metrics calculates and compares energy efficiency using an algorithm of cooling provided divided by the electrical power needed. Another metric includes the power required for the rack-mounted electronic equipment, thus providing a metric for total power required. All of the devices were effective in cooling the information technology (IT) equipment. The overall energy use efficiency varied considerably for a given cooling device configuration...|$|R
50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the <b>wire,</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>cools,</b> decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) {{model for}} a unit cell of a data center with a hot aisle-cold aisle (HACA) layout is simulated. Inefficiencies dealing with the mixing of hot air present in the room, with the cold inlet air leading {{to a loss of}} cooling potential are identified. For existing facilities, an algorithm called the Ambient Intelligence based Load Management (AILM) is developed which enhances the net data center heat dissipation capacity for given energy consumption at the facilities end. It gives a scheme to determine how much and where the computer loads should be allocated, based on the differential loss in cooling potential per unit increase in server workload. While the gains predicted are validated numerically initially, experimental validation is conducted using server simulators. For new facilities, a novel layout of the data center is designed, which uses scalable pods (S-Pod) based cabinet arrangement and air delivery. For the same floor space, the S-Pod and HACA facilities are simulated for different velocities, and the results are compared. An approach to incorporate heterogeneity in data centers, both for lower heat dissipation and liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>racks</b> has been established. Various performance metrics for data centers have been analyzed and sorted {{on the basis of their}} applicability.

40|$|Broad Funding Opportunity Announcement Project: GM {{is using}} shape memory alloys that require {{as little as}} a 10 °C {{temperature}} difference to convert low-grade waste heat into mechanical energy. When a stretched wire made of shape memory alloy is heated, it shrinks back to its pre-stretched length. When the <b>wire</b> <b>cools</b> back down, it becomes more pliable and can revert to its original stretched shape. This expansion and contraction can be used directly as mechanical energy output or used to drive an electric generator. Shape memory alloy heat engines have been around for decades, but the few devices that engineers have built were too complex, required fluid baths, and had insufficient cycle life for practical use. GM is working to create a prototype that is practical for commercial applications and capable of operating with either air- or fluid-based heat sources. GM’s shape memory alloy based heat engine is also designed for use in a variety of non-vehicle applications.

50|$|Most superconducting magnets {{have their}} coils of superconductive wire {{immersed}} in liquid helium, inside a vessel called a cryostat.
