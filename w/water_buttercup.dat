5000|$|Ranunculus flabellaris is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the buttercup genus, Ranunculus, known by the common name yellow <b>water</b> <b>buttercup.</b> It is native to much of North America, including the southern half of Canada {{and most of the}} United States.|$|E
50|$|The dune soil is {{calcareous}} {{because of}} the high percentage of seashell fragments which leads to a flora with lime-loving plants that are otherwise rare in Cornwall. The flora also includes at least sixty-six species of moss, making it one of richest sites in Cornwall. A number of rare plant species have been recorded on the site, these include Babington's leek (Allium babingtonii), brackish <b>water</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus baudotii), Cornish gentian (Gentianella anglica subsp. cornubiensis), fragrant evening-primrose (Oenothera stricta), Italian lords-and-ladies (Arum italicum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), shore-dock (Rumex rupestris), slender spike rush (Eleocharis acicularis), variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum) and wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). Due to its importance as a site for lichens and rare plant species, Plantlife has designated the dunes an Important Plant Area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buttercup}} family (Ranunculaceae) has Drummond's anemone (Anemone drummondii), a showy perennial. Alpine columbine, or sierra yellow columbine (Aquilegia pubescens), [...] "among {{the most}} spectacular eastern sierra flowers", grows as a 20 in or smaller cushion, to 12000 ft. Unlike lower elevations, which are pollinated by hummingbirds that do not reach alpine elevations, alpine columbine is pollinated by moths, so are upright and totally ultraviolet reflecting white. Mountain larkspur (Delphinium glaucum) grows in wet meadows to 12000 ft. High mountain larkspur grows among willows and rocks along creeks, also up to 12000 ft elevation. Buttercups (Ranunculus) are among the earliest blooming of the alpine zone. <b>Water</b> plantain <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus alismifolius) grows in wet meadows and banks up to 12000 ft, elevation. Alpine buttercup, or Eschscholtz's buttercup (R. eschscholtzii) {{can be found in}} rocky areas and meadows up to 13000 ft or 13500 ft elevation. Alpine buttercup is conspicuous with its bright lemon yellow flowers, which contrast with their rock environment.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, Caltha palustris {{is known}} {{by a variety}} of vernacular names, varying by {{geographical}} region. These include in addition to the most common two, marsh marigold and kingcup, also brave bassinets, crazy Beth, horse blob, May blob, mare blob, boots, water boots, meadow-bright, bullflower, meadow buttercup, <b>water</b> <b>buttercup,</b> soldier's buttons, meadow cowslip, water cowslip, publican's cloak, crowfoot, water dragon, drunkards, water goggles, meadow gowan, water gowan, yellow gowan, goldes, golds, goldings, gools, cow lily, marybuds, and publicans-and-sinners. The common name [...] "marigold" [...] refers to its use in medieval churches at Easter as a tribute to the Virgin Mary, as in [...] "Mary gold". In North America Caltha palustris is sometimes known as cowslip. However, cowslip more often refers to Primula veris, the original plant to go by that name. Both are herbaceous plants with yellow flowers, but Primula veris is much smaller.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{results of an}} {{investigation}} into the structure and temporal distribution of the community of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the <b>water</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Batrachium aquatile) vegetation in one of the drainage channels in an agricultural land near Olomouc, Czech Republic. Twelve quantitative samplings of submerged vegetation and associated macrofauna were carried out during September 1994 – August 1995. The dense monoculture of B. aquatile (mean annual dry mass 217 g. m – 2) on the muddy bottom of the channel presented a very suitable substratum for a colonization by invertebrates. The mean annual abundance of macroinvertebrates was 18273 N. m – 2. The total of 30 animal taxa were found during the study period. Chironomid larvae were the most abundant taxon (53 % of the total abundance on average). Another taxa with more than 5 % share were: Amphipoda, Oligochaeta, Isopoda, Bivalvia. Concerning the total biomass of phytomacrofauna, Amphipoda had a 38 % share on it followed by: Megaloptera, Chironomidae, Isopoda, Hirudinea. The mean Shannon’s diversity index of the phytophilous community was H = 1. 40, the mean equitability index J = 0. 54. A significant correlation of diversity index (and equitability index as well) with the buttercup biomass during the year was found. Both indexes have been undervalued because taxa higher than species were comprised to their computation. Neither changes of the total abundance and biomass of invertebrates nor seasonal dynamics of individual taxa were related to dynamics of B. aquatile biomass. Changes of the phytomacrofauna community {{in the course of the}} year result from life histories of individual species of this community...|$|E
