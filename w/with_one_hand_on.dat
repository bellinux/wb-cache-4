25|$|The exaggerated walk, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the small}} of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E

500|$|Six runs {{after the}} fall of Washbrook, the {{diminutive}} Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
500|$|His {{coaching}} brought immediate improvement. In 1897 and 1898, the Carlisle {{teams had}} 6–4 records. In 1899 (Warner's first year), Carlisle won nine and lost two games—to the country's two best teams: Harvard and Princeton. That year saw Carlisle's first major victory, {{against one of}} the [...] "Big Four" [...] teams, beating Penn 16–5. At the end of the season, the school played Columbia at the Polo Grounds in New York City, a premier sports venue at the time, defeating them 42–0. The Columbia game {{was the first time that}} a crouching start, a form of what is now known as a three point stance, was used by the running backs. Before Warner's innovation, the stance for a back before the ball was snapped was bent forward with his feet well apart and his hands on his knees. Warner realized that if his players took a stance similar to the one taken by sprinters, the legs would be bent, the back leaning forward, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the ground and the other arm cocked back to the thigh/hip region. Like with sprinters, this similar stance maximized the speed of his players. Shortly after, it became the standard football stance for both backs and linemen.|$|E
500|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, {{sparking}} much acrimony and {{controversy in the}} English cricket community. The reason {{was said to be}} Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton’s replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, fending <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia’s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent’s weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E

500|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar {{position in the}} middle order. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363. Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener George Emmett, who was surprised by a rising ball from Ray Lindwall. Emmett took {{his eyes from the}} ball and fended <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two catches later in the day, but neither cost Australia substantially. Jack Crapp hit Ernie Toshack to Barnes at short leg, who failed to hold the catch. However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after. During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22. Tail-ender Dick Pollard came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from Ian Johnson into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost {{on the edge of the}} cut strip. According to Fingleton, Barnes [...] "dropped like a fallen tree", and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury. Briefly paralysed on his left side, he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.|$|E
2500|$|The mounts {{used are}} called 'polo ponies', {{although}} the term pony is purely traditional and the mount {{is actually a}} full-sized horse. They range from [...] high at the withers, and weigh [...] The polo pony is selected carefully for quick bursts of speed, stamina, agility and manoeuvrability. Temperament is critical; the horse must remain responsive under pressure and not become excited or difficult to control. Many are Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred crosses. They are trained to be handled <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the reins, and {{to respond to the}} rider's leg and weight cues for moving forward, turning and stopping. A well trained horse will carry its rider smoothly and swiftly to the ball and can account for 60 to 75 percent of the player's skill and net worth to his team.|$|E
2500|$|Under Ultimate rules, {{a player}} may catch the frisbee {{with one or}} two hands. A catch can grab the rim, or {{simultaneously}} grab {{the top and bottom of}} the frisbee -- in a clap-catch / [...] "pancake catch". Care is needed with the hand placement when catching <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive Ultimate game, one side of the frisbee can spin out of the player's hand, and the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. [...] For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee strongly and [...] "cleanly," [...] the general advice is to for a two hands when possible.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days after}} signing, the lockout {{ended with a}} new CBA. Ovechkin played his first game with the Capitals on 5 October 2005, scoring two goals against goalie Pascal Leclaire in a 3–2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. On 13 January 2006, in Anaheim, Ovechkin scored his first career hat trick against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to help Washington win the game. Three days later, on 16 January, he scored a goal that veteran hockey {{reporter}} Bill Clement called [...] "one of the greatest goals of all time." [...] Knocked down by Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Paul Mara and sliding on his back facing away from the net, Ovechkin was able to hook the puck <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his stick and slide it into the net past goalie Brian Boucher for his second goal of the night. It became referred to as [...] "The Goal." [...] On 1 February, Ovechkin was named NHL Rookie of the Month for January 2006 {{as well as being}} named Offensive Player of the Month, becoming only the third player in NHL history to earn both honors simultaneously.|$|E
