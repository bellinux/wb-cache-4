People try to tell you <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never tell you <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, {{in so far as}} a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an actionâ€”if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E

60|$|But here now, {{the wise}} men of our days are so well skilled as {{that they have}} both the manner and matter of their prayers at their finger-ends; setting such a prayer for such a day, and that twenty years before it comes.

He speaks in our hearts day and night; whenever {{we have a good}} thought, He speaks in our hearts, and says to us: [...] "I am the King of your spirit. It must obey me. I put this good thought into your hearts, and you are bound to follow that good thought, because it is a law of my kingdom." [...] Or again, God speaks in our hearts, and says to us: [...] "You have done this wrong thing. You know that it is wrong. You know that it is an offence against my law. Why have you rebelled against me?" [...] Or again, when we see anyone do a good, a loving, or a noble action; or when we read of the lives of good and noble men and women; above all, when we read or hear of the character and doings of the blessed Lord Jesus, then and there God speaks in our hearts, and stirs us up to love and admire these noble and blessed examples, and says to us: [...] "That is right.

60|$|And you, young {{convinced}} ones, be you entreated and exhorted to a diligent and chaste waiting upon God, {{in the way}} of his blessed manifestation {{and appearance}} of himself to you. Look not out, but within: let not another's liberty be your snare: neither act by imitation, but by sense and feeling of God's power in yourselves: crush not the tender buddings of it in your souls, nor over-run, in your desires and warmness of affections, the holy and gentle motions of it. Remember it is a still voice that speaks to us in this day, and that it is not to be heard in the noises and hurries of the mind; but is distinctly understood in a retired frame. Jesus loved and chose solitudes, often going to mountains, gardens, and sea sides, to avoid crowds and hurries: to show his disciples it was good to be solitary, and sit loose to the world. Two enemies lie near your states, imagination and liberty; but the plain, practical, living, holy truth, that has convinced you, will preserve you, if you mind it in yourselves, and bring all thoughts, inclinations, and affections, to the test of it, to see if they are wrought in God, or of the enemy, or of your ownselves: so will a true taste, discerning, and judgment, be preserved to you, of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> and leave undone. And in your diligence and faithfulness in this way, you will come to inherit substance; and Christ, the eternal wisdom, will fill your treasury. And when you are converted, as well as convinced, then confirm your brethren; and be ready to every good word and work, that the Lord shall call you to: that you may be to his praise, who has chosen you to be partakers, with the saints in light, of a kingdom that cannot be shaken, an inheritance incorruptible in eternal habitations.|$|E
