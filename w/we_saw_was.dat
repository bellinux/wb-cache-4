500|$|In {{her first}} {{review of the}} series, Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{expressed}} her enjoyment of the episode, believing the following week would be [...] "pretty difficult to top tonight's ep." [...] Busis praised the final fairytale scenes as [...] "intense, effective..... awesome." [...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 7/10, giving praise to Robert Carlyle and guest actor Brad Dourif, but criticizing Lana Parrilla's constant [...] "dagger stares and pursed lips" [...] to Emma. Ratcliffe did however believe Ginnifer Goodwin and Joshua Dallas had [...] "electric chemistry," [...] and wished viewers could see more scenes between the two. Like Ratcliffe, Digital Spy columnist Catriona Wightman lauded Parrilla and Carlyle's performances, believing the latter [...] "continues {{to be one of}} the best things about Once Upon A Time - this completely new version of Rumpelstiltskin <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> illuminating. Turns out he does cowardly and pathetic quite well." ...|$|E
500|$|Saari also posted another {{video on}} a Finnish social {{networking}} site, {{in which he}} pointed a gun at the camera and said in English [...] "You will die next", followed by firing four shots {{in the direction of}} the camera. This video was not available to the police when Saari was questioned. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "The only video <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> where he was shooting at the range. It was only afterwards that much more information came out." [...] Police said that Saari would have been detained if they had known about this video at the time of the questioning. Police said that they believed Saari's videos were shot by someone else, and that they were trying to identify who this person was. The Chief Investigator of the case, Jari Neulaniemi, speculated that the cameraman may have been the friend of Saari's who was murdered.|$|E
500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} situation in Tibet makes the area especially sensitive, {{but it is also}} reported by some Western media that a number of simmering socio-economic issues may have led to the riots in Lhasa on March 14. The Economist reporter James Miles, when asked in an interview if the Dalai Lama was responsible for the riots, responded that he [...] "didn't see any evidence of any organized activity" [...] and that [...] "it's more likely that what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> yes inspired by a general desire of Tibetans both inside Tibet and among the Dalai Lama's followers, {{to take advantage of this}} Olympic year. But also inspired simply by all these festering grievances on the ground in Lhasa," [...] and he noted in another report that [...] " [...] rioting seemed to be primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred." [...] Some Tibetans also complained about social discrimination, unequal pay, and rumors that Tibetan monks had been arrested, and even killed, in the days before the riots.|$|E
60|$|The next land <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Wales. It {{was high}} noon, {{and a long}} line of purple {{mountains}} lay like banks of clouds against the east.|$|E
60|$|When we {{went out}} on deck the next morning, the first person <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Corny, {{holding on to the}} flag-staff at the bow and looking {{over the edge of the}} deck into the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay," [...] {{interrupted}} Cicely, [...] "that may stand, {{we have no}} time. My {{lord and}} you escaped from Lincoln, did you not, and, as <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>were</b> taken in the forest?" ...|$|R
60|$|Nearly all {{the vessels}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> war craft. There {{were a few}} {{lighters}} and barges, {{but none of the}} great merchantmen such as ply the upper air between the cities of the outer world.|$|R
50|$|Tom Wilkins {{lives by}} the motto, “What <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> what you get!” Lumber is all native, sold rough or planed. The mill also sells bark mulch (not dyed), woodchips, sawdust and shavings: {{every piece of}} the log is utilized.|$|R
60|$|Sailing on, {{the next}} land <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> thickly wooded: hedged round about by {{mangrove}} trees; which {{growing in the}} water, yet lifted high their boughs. Here and there were shady nooks, half verdure and half water. Fishes rippled, and canaries sung.|$|E
6000|$|... "We tried {{our best}} to get a man for you," [...] said Mrs. Rindge to Honora. [...] "Didn't we, Abby? But in the little time we had, it was impossible. The only man <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Ned Carrington, and Hugh said he didn't think you'd want him." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this, I {{sent for}} the log-book, and ascertained, {{by day and}} date, that the Crisis was not within fifty leagues of the spot, where we {{encountered}} the thunder-squall. Of course the ship <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a stranger; most probably a whaler. This destroyed any little hope that was left concerning Marble's fate.|$|E
60|$|And he was right. When we {{went down}} to the wharf the next morning, to find the Oclawaha boat, the first persons <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> Mr. Chipperton, with his wife and daughter. They were standing, gazing at the steam-boat which was to take us on our trip.|$|R

60|$|Now, in Letter II (July 18, 1600), from Logan to Bower, Logan, as <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>is</b> made to write, ‘See that my Lord, my brother, gets no {{knowledge}} of our purposes, for I (sic) rather be eirdit quik.’ The phrase recurs in another of the forged letters not produced in court.|$|R
60|$|And {{the last}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the bloody car {{rounding}} {{the corner and}} old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.|$|E
60|$|The crowd now {{ran with}} terrible yells towards a {{neighbouring}} hill or mound, {{on which we}} observed {{the framework of a}} house lying ready to be erected. Sick with horror, yet fascinated by curiosity, we staggered after them mechanically, scarce knowing where we were going or what we did, and feeling a sort of impression that all <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a dreadful dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us begin afresh!" [...] This {{piece of}} obvious common sense seemed then to me {{instinct}} with courage, the noblest of words. My heart {{went out to}} him as he spoke. It was, indeed, that day as vague as it was valiant; we did not at all see the forms of what we were thus beginning. All that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the clear inevitableness that the old order should end. [...] .|$|E

And, as her room is next to this, it will be easy {{to make a small}} hole through which I can satisfy myself whether I am right or not.' ...|$|R

60|$|The Kalubi {{came up to}} us, and in a shy kind of way {{tried to}} make conversation. I think that the sight of this mountain, drawing ever nearer, vividly {{recalled}} his terrors and caused him to desire to efface the bad impression {{he knew he had}} made on us, to whom he looked for safety. Among other things he told us that the hole <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the door of the House of the Motombo.|$|E
60|$|We {{went through}} it ag'in, and then Bill went half-way up the fo'c's'le ladder and called softly for Jimmy. He called three times, and then, with a sinking {{sensation}} in 'is stummick, 'e went up on deck and I follered 'im. The boy {{was nowhere to be}} seen. All <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> the ship's cat 'aving a wash and brush-up afore going ashore, and the skipper standing aft talking to the owner.|$|E
60|$|Beyond these, in a yet {{darker and}} drearier dungeon, stood a heavy oblong wooden box, with two {{apertures}} near the top, peering {{through which we}} found that we were looking into the eyeless sockets of a skull. Within this box Ecelino had immured the victim we beheld there, and left him to perish {{in view of the}} platters of food and goblets of drink placed just beyond the reach of his hands. The food <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> of course not the original food.|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{went down}} stairs <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> {{in the midst of}} the finest farming section we ever see. About two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove {{surrounded}} by a wide-spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out-houses.|$|R

60|$|We saw no fowl there, except gulls {{of various}} kinds; but the {{greatest}} store of them that ever <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> on a flat but slightly covered with water {{on the east side}} of the harbor, and we observed a man who had landed there from a boat creeping along the shore in order to get a shot at them, but they all rose and flew away in a great scattering flock, too soon for him, having apparently got their dinners, though he did not get his.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next morning}} {{we find that the}} flood has subsided. I geared up the bays, and we splashed out through the mud, some precarious, until we found the road again. We were only a few miles wrong, and in two hours we were in Oklahoma City. The first thing <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a big {{restaurant}} sign, and we piled into there in a hurry. Here I finds myself sitting with Mame at table, with knives and forks and plates between us, and she not scornful, but smiling with starvation and sweetness.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we reached}} the Academy there were scores of {{students}} there {{from all over the}} Island. The first person <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth he was doing {{and he said he was}} repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place! ...|$|E

In fact it was completely demolished, scattered about like kindling. The largest things <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> the braces which are especially strong—they were about one and a half or two meters long and 50–60 centimeters wide. As for the rest—broken into tiny pieces..." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> Came, <b>We</b> <b>Saw...</b> <b>is</b> {{an album}} of {{compiled}} live tracks by the Welsh rock band Budgie, culled from their performances at the Reading Festival in 1980 and 1982 respectively, {{with an emphasis on}} songs released during that period rather than the band's older, more well-known work. Heavier Than Air - Rarest Eggs is a companion to this album. These tracks were later included, along with others, on the 2006 collection The BBC Recordings.|$|R
