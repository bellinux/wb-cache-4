5|$|In January 1976 {{the band}} {{took a break}} from their live {{performances}} to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio. Sessions began in early February 1976 and were completed within a week for $6,400; the instruments took three days and the vocal parts were recorded in four days. In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded Ramones quickly due to budget restrictions, but also that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time they needed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{difficult}} return leg, Celtic toiled {{to break down}} a dour Boavista side who knew that a scoreless draw <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese side required to reach the final. However, an opportunistic strike by Larsson on 80 minutes won the match and the tie for Celtic, meaning that Celtic would go through to the UEFA Cup Final, preventing an all-Portugal, and all-Oporto, final.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union.

5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a three-run homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{elements}} of the battalion suffered similar problems, however; on the same day, 9 January, B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of Rittershoffen, with four more the next day, while another section working with the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine. These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days, unable to withdraw, and acquitted themselves well in close fighting. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more of an achievement when it was considered that, leaving disciplinary problems aside, the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced. One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star, while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars—it is unclear if these were ever awarded.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 2006, Fuller {{signed for}} Conference side Stevenage Borough. He made his debut for the Boro in a 2–1 defeat by York City on 15 August 2006. The defender scored his only {{goal for the}} club in a 2–0 win over Grays Athletic on 17 February 2007. He was ever-present {{throughout}} the 2006–07 season, making thirty-seven league appearances in all. He was also indispensable to the club's FA Trophy success, featuring in both semi-final legs which saw Stevenage Borough beat Grays Athletic 3–1 on aggregate. He {{was part of the}} squad that played in the 2007 FA Trophy Final against Kidderminster Harriers on 12 May 2007 in front of a record FA Trophy crowd of 53,262. Stevenage came back from 2–0 down to ultimately triumph 3–2 following an 88th-minute goal by Steve Morison; the victory <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more significant for Fuller as he {{became a member of the}} first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium. He would go on to make 24 league appearances for the Boro during the 2007–08 season before subsequently leaving the club to sign a two-year deal with League One side Gillingham on 28 January 2008 along with team-mate Stuart Lewis; reuniting him with the manager who had previously recruited him at Stevenage Borough, Mark Stimson.|$|E
