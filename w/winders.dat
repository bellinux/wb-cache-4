25|$|A {{report on}} the state of the burgh of Calton {{presented}} by a magistrate to the British Association described high levels of pilfering, including the bowl weft system generally carried on by weavers and <b>winders.</b> These workers embezzled cotton yarns, silks, etc. and sold them to small manufacturers to eke out their wages by an amount estimated at one penny per day for each man.|$|E

On the road leading to the camp site, Camilleri became disturbed at the car bottoming out on the uneven gravel road and became angry at the girls. The rear doors of the vehicle had been previously locked using the vehicle's child locks and there were no window <b>winders,</b> preventing the rear doors from being opened by passengers inside. Camilleri produced a knife and told the girls they would be stabbed if they tried to escape. Beckett also produced a knife and went along with Camilleri in threatening the girls.|$|E

50|$|<b>Winder</b> {{was the son}} of John H. <b>Winder,</b> who was {{a career}} officer in the US Army until the American Civil War (1861-1865), when he joined the Confederates and became a general. <b>Winder</b> had a half-brother, named William S. <b>Winder,</b> who was an attorney. <b>Winder's</b> {{grandfather}} was William H. <b>Winder,</b> a general in the U.S. Army in the war of 1812. In 1851, <b>Winder</b> married Abby Rice Goodwin (February 1829 - May 9, 1906) of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the daughter of New Hampshire governor, Ichabod Goodwin. Another of Goodwin's daughters married Admiral George Dewey.

40|$|Article history: The {{dynamics}} of the <b>winder</b> roller of a roll-to-roll printing system for printed electronics is a time-varying system because of the variation of the <b>winder</b> roller radius owing to rewinding or unwinding of the web. Therefore, an adaptive control method considering the time-variant characteristics is required for precise tension control. In this study, the variable PID gain method {{is applied to the}} actual roll-to-roll system and verified by experiments for unwinder tension control. The required value of the <b>winder</b> roller radius for the application of the variable PID gain is estimated from the measurement of the <b>winder</b> tension and <b>winder</b> motor torque. The simulation results as well as experimental results show that the fixed PID gain control cannot stabilize the tension of the <b>winder</b> roller with varying <b>winder</b> roller radius. On the other hand, the variable PID gain method can control the tension of the <b>winder</b> roller regardless of the <b>winder</b> roller radius...|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Amy calms the girl, named Mandy, and {{learns that}} her friend had {{disappeared}} {{in a hole}} on the ship. Despite Mandy's warnings about the robot-like Smilers and their monk-like <b>Winders</b> that maintain order on the ship, Amy investigates a tented area around the hole. A tentacle-like entity emerges, and she backs out into a group of <b>Winders.</b> They take her to one of many voting booths {{set up on the}} ship. She is shown a video about the truth of Starship UK, and then asked if she wants to [...] "protest" [...] the truth or [...] "accept" [...] it, the latter causing her short-term memory to be wiped. Amy chooses to accept, and creates a video to herself to prevent the Doctor from learning the truth, before the mind wipe. By then, Mandy had led the Doctor to the booth as Amy finishes watching the video to herself. The Doctor is curious as what [...] "protest" [...] will cause and activates it, sending he and Amy into the maw of a giant creature below the ship. The Doctor induces the creature to vomit, allowing them to escape back to the ship, where Liz 10 and Mandy helps them avoid the Smilers and <b>Winders</b> after them. As they flee, Liz 10 explains she is Queen Elizabeth X, the ruler of the ship.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Winders</b> {{eventually}} {{capture the}} group, {{and they are}} taken to the Tower of London. The Doctor discovers that Starship UK rides atop a giant Star Whale, and controlled by sending painful electrical impulses to its brain via a control panel in the Tower. Liz 10 recalls {{she was the one}} that ordered this, and had chosen to wipe her memory to forget that action, creating the voting booths {{for the rest of the}} population to do the same, as they fear if they [...] "abdicate" [...] and release the Whale from this slavery, it will destroy Starship UK. The Doctor is furious, not only at having to choose between saving humanity or the Whale, but also at Amy for trying to keep him from making that choice. The Doctor decides to make the Whale brain-dead, allowing it to continuing travelling. As the Doctor starts the process, Amy observes Mandy has found her friend, unharmed. She forces Liz 10 to hit the abdicate control; to everyone's surprise, the Whale continues travelling, at a faster speed. Amy posits that like the Doctor, the Whale had come to Earth willingly to help save the remaining children, and is helping Starship UK.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{coal mining}} {{industry}} was nationalised in 1947. [...] Whilst this was done, {{in the words}} of the Labour Party Constitution, [...] "To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service" [...] as part of a wider process of nationalisation it did allow the coalfield to be modernised and streamlined in a way that had not been achieved in the previous decades. [...] The National Coal Board management in the 40 years following nationalisation, closed inefficient and worked out collieries, amalgamated and combined other collieries to form larger production units where significant assets such as skip <b>winders</b> and coal washing and grading facilities could be used by several collieries and opened new drift mines which could be fitted with the latest equipment. The results of these actions carried out against a backdrop of a volatile and declining market was that by the time the collieries of South Yorkshire were sold to private owners in the mid nineties the coal they produced was some of the cheapest in the developed world.|$|E
2500|$|When Captain Borlase {{arrived as}} the chief agent (mine manager) in 1889 {{it was clear that}} the engine shaft in the Lucy Level had been sunk too far to the south to work the long stretch of good ore that had been found near its {{northern}} end. Also, having been sunk into the footwall, longer and longer cross-cuts were needed to reach the vein from it. Another problem was that limited water resources would place limits on the winding and pumping capacities of the hydraulic engines as the mine deepened. Borlase proposed bold solutions to both problems. First he proposed building a hydroelectric power station further up the Glenridding valley, where water supply was abundant, but could not easily be used in the mine. Electricity could then be used for pumps and winding engines as well as for powering a locomotive. The electric <b>winders</b> and locomotive were to be the first ones installed in a metalliferous mine in Britain. Borlase also proposed a new engine shaft [...] north of the existing shaft, to be sunk initially in the hanging wall, from an eastern extension to Warsop's Crosscut. This (the third shaft at the mine) became known as Smith's Shaft, in honour of Robert Bradshaw Smith, one of the directors and the principal shareholder. Smith's Shaft is about [...] from the entrance to the Lucy Tongue Level.|$|E
