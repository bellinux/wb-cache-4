50|$|Wind tunnel {{work on the}} Electra was {{undertaken}} at the University of Michigan. Much of the work was performed by a student assistant, Clarence Johnson. He suggested two changes {{be made to the}} design: changing the single tail to double tails (later a Lockheed trademark), and deleting oversized <b>wing</b> <b>fillets.</b> Both of these suggestions were incorporated into production aircraft. Upon receiving his master's degree, Johnson joined Lockheed as a regular employee, ultimately leading the Skunk Works in developing advanced aircraft such as the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.|$|R

50|$|The Albatros was {{intended}} {{to take advantage of}} a number of aerodynamic refinements to achieve a higher performance than other standard class gliders. These include a new type of fuselage <b>wing</b> <b>fillet</b> that creates laminar flow in the junction, upper and lower surface wing and aileron boundary layer blowing and an airfoil designed by Professor Loek M. M. Boermans of the Delft University of Technology. The aileron blowing varies with airspeed. The company claims that this creates 95% laminar flow on the wing underside and produces 10% less profile drag than the Schleicher ASW 24.|$|E

During the second pass, at least six missiles were fired, each confirmed by missile vapor trails on mission photography. Looking through his rear-view periscope, Sullivan saw six missile vapor trails climb to about 90000 ft before converging on his aircraft. He noted the approach of four missiles, and although they all detonated behind him, one came within 100 yd to 200 yd of his aircraft.

50|$|The H.P47 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Forward of {{the single}} spar the wing {{was covered with a}} stressed metal skin, forming a torsion box. Behind the spar it was fabric-covered, the trailing edge carrying flaps inboard, from the <b>wing</b> <b>fillet</b> out to the ailerons, though the centre section was metal-skinned throughout. The leading edge carried slats in three sections to form slots across the whole span when extended. The inboard pair were opened when the flaps were lowered and the outer slots were automatic, with interceptors connected to the ailerons for lateral control at high angles of attack. Behind the radial Bristol Pegasus IM3 engine, producing 650 hp (485 kW) and enclosed in a Townend ring, the semi-monocoque, corrugated skinned fuselage grew in diameter to the pilot's midwing cockpit then remaining constant rearwards to the gunner's position. He sat facing rearwards below the upper fuselage line and out of the slipstream, at a point where the fuselage stepped to a slim and narrowing oval boom. There was usable space inside the fuselage between the cockpits, enough to carry three passengers or two stretcher cases. All the tail surfaces moved; the fin, mounted ahead of the tailplane, moved with the horn-balanced rudder but through smaller angles, changing the camber, and the tailplane and single elevator were similarly coupled. All these rear control surfaces were covered with corrugated stressed skin. Specification G.4/31 included the dropping of torpedoes, so the underside of the aircraft had to be clear, and with wing fuel tanks the main undercarriage was fixed. The legs were mounted {{at the end of the}} centre section, each with a rearward strut and a long bracing strut outwards to the main spar. These struts were faired and both main and tailwheels spatted. The mainwheels were fitted with brakes.|$|E
50|$|Drawing on his {{experience}} with the Lockheed Vega, John K. Northrop designed an advanced mail/passenger transport aircraft. In addition to all-metal construction, the new Alpha benefitted from two revolutionary aerodynamic advancements: <b>wing</b> <b>fillets</b> researched at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and a multicellular stressed-skin wing of Northrop's own design which was later successfully used on the Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3. In addition, the Alpha was the first commercial aircraft to use rubber deicer boots on wing and empennage leading edges which, in conjunction with state-of-the-art radio navigation equipment, gave it day or night, all-weather capability. The aircraft first flew in 1930, {{with a total of}} 17 built.|$|R

50|$|BI-7 {{was flown}} twice with the RD-1 engine, on January 24 and March 9, 1945. Pallo reports {{there was an}} {{emergency}} with the landing gear during the January flight. In addition to the new engine, various changes {{were made to the}} aircraft's design: a larger rudder, smaller false keel, and different <b>wing</b> <b>fillets.</b> During the test flights, the pilot Boris Kudrin, noticed some tailfin flutter. On May 29, the pilot M.K. Baykalov tested the BI-7 in glider mode, without starting the engine, and the flutter was not detected. At this point, the aircraft was too corroded by nitric acid to fly again, and it was retired. To further investigate the flutter problem, BI-5 was modified in the same fashion as BI-7 (but with no engine) and tested in glider flights; however, the problem was not reproduced.|$|R

40|$|A {{pressure-sensitive}} paint (PSP) {{technique was}} applied in a wind tunnel {{experiment in the}} NASA Langley Research Center 8 -Foot Transonic Pressure Tunnel to quantify the effect of <b>wing</b> <b>fillets</b> on the global vortex-induced surface static pressure field about a sharp leading-edge 76 deg/ 40 deg double delta wing, or strake-wing, model at subsonic and transonic speeds. Global calibrations of the PSP were obtained at M = 0. 50, 0. 70, 0. 85, 0. 95, and 1. 20, a Reynolds number per unit length of 2. 0 million, and angles of attack from 10 degrees to 30 degrees using an in-situ method featuring the simultaneous acquisition of electronically-scanned pressures (ESP) at discrete locations on the model. The mean error in the PSP measurements relative to the ESP data was approximately 2 percent or less at M = 0. 50 to 0. 85 but increased to several percent at M = 0. 95 and 1. 20. The PSP pressure distributions and pseudo-colored planform view pressure maps clearly revealed the vortex-induced pressure signatures at all Mach numbers and angles of attack. Small fillets having a parabolic or diamond planform situated at the strake-wing intersection were designed to manipulate the vortical flows by, respectively, removing the leading-edge discontinuity or introducing additional discontinuities. The fillets caused global changes in the vortex-dominated surface pressure field that were effectively captured in the PSP measurements. The vortex surface pressure signatures were compared to available off-surface vortex cross-flow structures obtained using a laser vapor screen (LVS) flow visualization technique.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} first flew on 25 May 1956, reaching Mach 1.44 {{in one of}} the flights. After {{the addition}} of 60° <b>wing</b> root <b>fillets,</b> a 13.5 in (35 cm) fuselage extension, and an uprated J79 engine, the F11F-1F reached an impressive Mach 2.04 in 1957, thus becoming the first naval aircraft in the world to exceed Mach 2 (two years before the F4H, the F8U-3 and the A3J). This was a surprise even to Grumman, which had expected a top speed of only Mach 1.4 at altitude. By comparison, the F11F-1 with the Wright J65 had had difficulty exceeding Mach 1.1. However, the U.S. Navy did not order the Super Tiger into production. Although the service ceiling of the aircraft was nominally 59,000 feet, a test flight on 18 April 1958 at Edwards AFB set a world altitude record of 76,938 feet.|$|R

50|$|The Falcon 20 is {{furnished}} {{with a highly}} swept wing; it is equipped with leading-edge slats to improve its slow speed performance and increase the stalling speed. When approaching a high angle of attack, the slats are automatically deployed; when nearing a potential stall, the inner section of the slats then retract to provide for a stable and predictable stall with effective aileron controls throughout. On the Falcon 200 model, the wing was re-profiled for improved low-speed performance and shortened runway requirements, {{as well as the}} addition of an unusual <b>wing</b> root <b>fillet</b> section and a shortened wing fence; the development of an entirely new wing was under consideration at one point, but the improved performance was not viewed to justify the expense. While air brakes are present upon the wing, these are less smooth and more noisy than the use of the dual-brake arrangement upon the landing gear.

40|$|The {{configuration}} {{consisted of}} a 30 deg -swept, untapered, untwisted wing utilizing a low-moment cambered airfoil of 20 percent streamwise thickness designed for low wave drag at M = 0. 6, C sub L = 0. 4. The tests covered a range of Mach numbers 0. 3 to 0. 725 and chord Reynolds number 1, 100, 000 to 2, 040, 000, angles of attack up to model buffet and sideslip angles + or - 4 deg. Configuration build up, <b>wing</b> pod <b>filleting,</b> airfoil modification and trailing edge control deflection effects were briefly investigated. Three wing tip vertical tail designs were also tested. Wing body filleting and a simple airfoil modification both produced increments to maximum lift/drag ratio.
