U.S. <b>wheat</b> is used <b>for</b> <b>blending</b> because of its high protein content compared to French soft wheat. Despite significant increases {{in the price of}} wheat in the international markets, the government froze flour and bread prices in November 2006, following strong pressure from consumers’ unions. The millers’ price of flour is currently CFA 264,000 per MT and the price of a baguette remains at CFA 150 instead of CFA 175 proposed by bakers’ associations. ($1 = CFA 507 on January 10, 2007.) ...|$|R
40|$|Bioplastics {{deriving}} from plant proteins are becoming an increasingly popular source of {{raw material for}} plastic products since {{they are not only}} biodegradable but renewable resources. However, these bioplastics require improved mechanical and water absorption properties to be suitable for many applications, such as packaging. For this reason, this study considers potato and rice proteins as a new source for the manufacture of bioplastics. The proteins were mixed with different glycerol concentrations followed by thermomoulding at temperatures from 60 to 180 degrees C. The resulting bioplastic is characterized in terms of thermo-mechanical properties, water absorption and molecular weight distribution. Compared to well-known wheat gluten, these bioplastics required higher temperatures for their thermomoulding. However, both of them were more structured materials and exhibited less water absorption (e. g. as low as 9 wt. %) than those obtained <b>for</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>blend.</b> Potato protein-based bioplastics showed complex modulus values comparable to synthetic polymers such as Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A high–speed color sorter has the {{potential}} to help wheat breeders purify their white wheat breeding lines and white wheat exporters meet purity requirements of end users. For this reason, a commercial color sorter was evaluated for sorting mixed red and white wheat. Ten wheat blends containing 95 % white and 5 % red wheat by mass were produced by mixing common cultivars of hard white and hard red winter wheat. The sorter was set to accept white wheat and reject red wheat in single pass when viewed by either a green or red filter. Percentages of red and white wheat in the accept and reject portions were determined by soaking in sodium hydroxide, a definitive method for determining if a wheat kernel is red or white. In order to reject most of the red wheat in a single pass through the sorter, at least 15 % of the original wheat mass needed to be rejected. <b>For</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>blends</b> with white wheat of consistent color that contrasted considerably with the red wheat contaminant, this rejection would reduce red wheat mass in the accept portion to < 1 %. This reduction could be achieved <b>for</b> most other <b>blends</b> when rejecting 20 to 25 % of the mass or through re–sorting the accept portion. The red filter resulted in more red kernels rejected than the green filter...|$|R
