5|$|The {{founding}} of a colonial college {{had long been}} the desire of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. As an Oxford-educated military commander <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> in the American Revolutionary War, Simcoe believed a college was needed to counter the spread of republicanism from the United States. The Upper Canada Executive Committee recommended in 1798 a college be established in York, the colonial capital.|$|E

All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|In 359, Julian {{restored}} seven forts {{and town}} {{walls in the}} middle Rhine, including Bonna (Bonn) and Bingium (Bingen), obliging his new tributary Alamanni to provide the supplies and labour needed. He then crossed the Rhine, marched through {{the territory of the}} tributaries and devastated the lands of the other kings <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> at Strasbourg, including Westralp. All were forced to submit and return the thousands of Roman civilians they had abducted and enslaved during the years of easy plunder.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the troops}} in the Coalition armies were inexperienced. The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, {{following}} the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With {{the exception of the}} British and some from Hanover and Brunswick <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld.

These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans who have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros. Resistance leaders Wendell Fertig, Russell W. Volckmann and Donald Blackburn would incorporate what they've learned fighting with the Filipino guerrillas in establishing {{what would become the}} U.S. Special Forces.|$|E
5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fought</b> and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council.
