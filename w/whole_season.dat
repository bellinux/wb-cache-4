5|$|Alonso's {{second season}} at Real Madrid {{started with the}} arrival of a new manager, José Mourinho. He was given the number 14 jersey after the {{departure}} of vice-captain Guti. He did not score any goals that <b>whole</b> <b>season</b> but was vital. While he believed that Real Madrid would win the league, the club only managed to win the Copa del Rey.|$|E
5|$|Yardley's {{only other}} {{representative}} appearance in 1948 was as {{captain of the}} Gentlemen against the Players at Lords, where he scored 61.

5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies {{were hard to}} come by as the season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the <b>whole</b> <b>season.</b> Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his slow}} scoring in the Tests, Hassett was dynamic in the Shield matches for Victoria. In two matches for Victoria between the Third and Fourth Tests, Hassett hit 200 against Queensland and 190 against NSW; in both innings he scored {{at a rate}} of almost 50 runs per hour. Victoria won both their matches against arch-rivals NSW convincingly, by an innings and 288 runs respectively, and won the Sheffield Shield, having secured victory {{in each of the four}} matches that Hassett played in. Hassett was highly {{productive}} throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>season,</b> ending with 1,213 runs at 71.35.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Giants {{honored the}} {{memories}} of two of their former players on their uniforms. A helmet sticker with the number 38 {{was added to the}} uniforms after John Tuggle, a former running back the Giants selected as the final pick of the 1983 draft, died of angiosarcoma in August 1986. After former defensive back and two-time Pro Bowler Spider Lockhart died of lymphoma in July 1986, a patch with Lockhart's nickname and number were added to the jerseys and the Giants wore both the sticker and the jersey patch the <b>whole</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{followed}} this by moving over the Welsh border to Aberystwyth Town {{for a year}} before joining Clevedon Town.

5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the <b>whole</b> <b>season,</b> with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whole</b> <b>season</b> {{is titled}} as The Trial of a Time Lord, and is split into four {{segments}}. The segments are {{commonly referred to}} by their working titles (listed below) but the season was broadcast as one fourteen-part story and the working titles did not appear on screen. Episode length returned to 25 minutes, but with only fourteen episodes in the season, making the total running time of this season (and subsequent seasons) just {{over half of the}} previous seasons, going back to season 7.|$|E
5|$|When Jardine {{went on to}} {{play for}} Surrey that season, a strong batting side, he played with more freedom. Batting at number five, he had to adapt his style {{depending}} on the match situation. He was successful, playing long defensive innings or sacrificing his innings {{in an attempt to}} hit quick runs. His captain Percy Fender retained him in the role {{for the rest of the}} season. He scored his first century for Surrey against Yorkshire and was awarded his County Cap, making 916 runs at an average of 38.16 in the <b>whole</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the <b>whole</b> <b>season.</b> Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1894 season, MacLaren {{resigned}} from the bank to play a <b>whole</b> <b>season</b> of cricket. Lancashire {{at the time were}} undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county {{in the first part of}} the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, 1895 {{the first}} wholly {{professional}} game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier {{became the first}} player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the <b>whole</b> <b>season,</b> becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. Later that year, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, then the St. Louis Cardinals and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.|$|E

5|$|In 1953-54, Ray had {{his most}} {{effective}} season and played in all seven of Victoria’s Shield matches, {{even though there}} were no Test matches for the summer, meaning that all the national team members were available for state selection for the <b>whole</b> <b>season.</b> He played the entire season alongside Neil, and the pair encountered Mick in both matches against Queensland. During the summer, Neil typically batted at No. 3, and Ray usually succeeded him. Despite this, they batted together only four times in 13 innings, as Neil was usually out first. Their first partnership came in the first innings of the second match of the season, against New South Wales. It was brief; Ray came in at 2/93 and scored two runs before falling at 3/97. They then batted together on New Year's Day in the first innings of the next match against South Australia. Ray came in to join Neil after the Victorians had slumped to be 2/5, and after twice coming close to century partnerships for their state in the past, the brothers put on 150 before Neil was out for 88 to leave the score at 3/165. Ray went on to make 110. In the following match against Queensland, Ray came in with the score at 2/65 and put on 82 with his brother before he was out for 50. Their only other partnership of the season amounted to 36 runs in the second innings of the return match against New South Wales; Neil was out for 47 as Ray guided the Victorians to their target with five wickets in hand, scoring 106 not out himself. Ray and Neil were also selected for the testimonial match for retiring Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. Neil played for Hassett’s XI while Ray was on the opposition team captained by Arthur Morris.|$|E
