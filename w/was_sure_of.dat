5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{reputation}} for bravery, Modu began to gather a group of extremely loyal warriors. To be sure of their loyalty, Modu ordered each of the warriors to shoot his favourite horse. Those who refused were executed. He later repeated this test of loyalty, but {{with one of his}} favourite wives, and once again executed those who hesitated to obey his order. After he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the loyalty of his remaining warriors, he ordered them to shoot at his father, killing him in a shower of arrows. With none of his followers failing to shoot at his command and the elimination of his father, Modu proclaimed himself Chanyu of the Xiongnu.|$|E
25|$|The President {{resolved}} to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North settled over the controversy. Cameron would not resign until he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> his successor, {{and that he}} could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of Minister to Russia presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned. As for a successor, Lincoln thought Joseph Holt best for the job, but his Secretary of State, William H. Seward, wanted Stanton to succeed Cameron. Salmon Chase, Stanton's friend and Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, agreed. Stanton had been preparing for a partnership with Samuel L. M. Barlow in New York, but abandoned these plans when he heard of his possible nomination. Lincoln nominated Stanton to the post of Secretary of War on January 13. He was confirmed two days following.|$|E

25|$|The Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the {{destruction}} by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets. He dated this event to the LM II period. This view stood until Carl Blegen excavated the site of ancient Pylos in 1939 and uncovered tablets inscribed in Linear B. They were fired in the conflagration that destroyed Pylos about 1200 BC, {{at the end of}} LHIIIB. With the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952, serious questions about Evans' date began to be considered. Most notably, Blegen said that the inscribed stirrup jars, which are oil flasks with stirrup-shaped handles, imported from Crete around 1200 were of the same type as those dated by Evans to {{the destruction}} of 1400. Blegen found a number of similarities between 1200 BC Pylos and 1400 BC Knossos and suggested the Knossian evidence be reexamined, as he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the 1200 Pylian date.|$|E
500|$|The Ottomans {{marched through}} Mat and pillaged the area. Skanderbeg took {{parallel}} routes through the mountains. Since {{he had not}} yet engaged Skanderbeg, Isak bey decided not to besiege Krujë, Albania's main fortress, until he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the Albanian's fate. He thus camped with his men in the area north of Mount Tumenishta (Skënderbeu) to wait for Skanderbeg's appearance. This region was called Albulena (...) , located south of modern-day Laç. It was surrounded by a series of protective hills where guards were placed. Since Tumenishta had served as the main base for Skanderbeg's forays into the Ottoman camp at the Siege of Krujë (1450), Isak bey and Hamza prepared to annihilate any resistance they would find there. This effort came in vain, however, as they were not challenged by any Albanian forces. Still unsure of Skanderbeg's dispositions, the Ottoman commanders strengthened the camp's northern defenses, while the eastern side, in the direction of Tumenishta, remained lightly defended. Ottoman scouts crossed the Mat River into northern Albania. They were seen at the gates of Venetian-held Alessio (Lezhë) and ventured deeper into Venetian territory.|$|E
500|$|In June 1581, the States-General {{appointed}} Norreys General {{of all the}} States' troops {{beyond the}} Meuse. In August, the Dutch local council, assembled in Leeuwarden, tasked Norreys with preventing Verdugo from penetrating further into the country, for which his 30 companies of infantry were reinforced by five cavalry companies under William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg. He was expected to besiege the Spanish forts around Groningen, but he lacked the artillery to do so, having been given only four small guns. Moreover, Norreys' Dutch and Walloon soldiers were unhappy with being {{under the command of}} a foreigner. Norreys spent the summer months attempting in vain to blockade Groningen, while Verdugo, who was aware of the dissent amongst the Dutch army, patiently waited in his fortified posts despite being urged by the local authorities to confront Norreys. [...] In early September, after a failed raid on his camp, Verdugo <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Norreys' intentions of giving battle, and thus he advanced his army to near Norreys' camp near the village of Noordhorn. Shortly thereafter, determined to fight, Norreys' Anglo-Dutch army was deployed over the dike of Niezijl.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just {{to get an idea}} what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per minute I said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez and his team of engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. He <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally goes in and snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound and squeezes it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E
500|$|The injured paceman {{blocked the}} first ball he faced—the {{third of the}} over—and ran a bye after missing the next. The West Indian wicket-keeper tried to run Meckiff out, but missed the stumps at the non-striker's end with the batsman many metres out of his ground. Grout top-edged the {{following}} ball straight up into the air, but the two fielders who converged beneath it collided and dropped the catch, allowing the Australians to take another run. The hosts thus needed three runs from the last three balls. Meckiff faced the sixth ball; it was a half volley and he lofted it over square leg. The ball {{looked as though it}} would reach the boundary for a match-winning four runs; however, after landing close to the fence, it stopped rolling a metre short on the slow outfield. Grout attempted a third run, which would have won the match, but an accurate long throw saw him run out. The last man Lindsay Kline came in for the final two balls, with scores level, and the Australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances. Meckiff backed up significantly in anticipation of a quick single, and set off for the winning run after his partner hit the ball to square leg. However, he was run out by roughly a metre when Joe Solomon directly hit the stumps from side on, causing the first tie in Test history. Umpire Col Hoy said of his decision to give Meckiff out: [...] "God, it was easy. He was miles out." [...] The entire stadium—players and spectators alike—invaded the ground in excitement, but nobody <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the exact scores. It was only later that they realised the match was the first Tied Test; Meckiff initially thought Australia had lost and blamed himself for the result.|$|E

2500|$|When he {{was arrested}} for treason, Seymour's {{associates}} were also cast under suspicion, including 15-year-old Elizabeth. Distraught over Thomas’s arrest, she did not realize her own danger until her servants, including her beloved governess, Kat, were also arrested. [...] Upon realizing that Thomas would probably be executed, she was noticeably disconsolate, trying to free herself and her servants from suspicion. The regency council <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> her complicity with Thomas, and sought to bully an easy confession from her. She was interrogated relentlessly for weeks. [...] But the council found itself in a sharply defined game of wits with Elizabeth, who proved to be a master of logic, defiance, and shrewdness. The embarrassing details of the flirtatious incidents with Thomas came to light. But {{there was no evidence that}} Elizabeth had conspired with him.|$|E
2500|$|In 538, {{during a}} major {{campaign}} between Western Wei and Eastern Wei, Wei Xiaokuan accompanied Emperor Wen, {{and he was}} made the governor of Hongnong Commandery (弘農, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). [...] He subsequently entered Luoyang (which Western Wei temporarily captured) with Dugu Xin, and for some time tried to defend the city, but eventually {{they were forced to}} withdrew from the vicinity of Luoyang. [...] As Wei was then stationed on the borders with Eastern Wei, he became concerned that the Eastern Wei general Niu Daoheng (牛道恆) was capable at drawing the common people of the border region to join Eastern Wei's cause. [...] Wei employed a tactic that he would reuse later—first sending spies to steal samples of Niu's handwriting, and then employing forgers to forge letters purportedly from Niu to Wei offering to defect to Western Wei. [...] He then intentionally allowed spies sent by Niu's superior Duan Chen (段琛) to steal the forgeries, causing Duan to suspect Niu's loyalty and begin to refuse to follow Niu's suggestions. [...] Once Wei <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the dissension within the Eastern Wei forces, he made a surprise attack and captured both Duan and Niu, taking the locale for Western Wei.|$|E
