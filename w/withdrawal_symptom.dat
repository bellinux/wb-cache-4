25|$|Rebound anxiety, {{more severe}} than {{baseline}} anxiety, is also a common <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> when discontinuing diazepam or other benzodiazepines. Diazepam is therefore only recommended for short-term therapy at the lowest possible dose owing to risks of severe withdrawal problems from low doses even after gradual reduction. The risk of pharmacological dependence on diazepam is significant, and patients experience symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome if it is taken for six weeks or longer. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam occurs frequently.|$|E
2500|$|Protracted {{withdrawal}} syndrome refers to symptoms persisting {{for months or}} even years. A significant minority of people withdrawing from benzodiazepines, perhaps 10 to 15%, experience a protracted {{withdrawal syndrome}} which can sometimes be severe. Symptoms may include tinnitus, psychosis, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal complaints, insomnia, paraesthesia (tingling and numbness), pain (usually in limbs and extremities), muscle pain, weakness, tension, painful tremor, shaking attacks, jerks, dizziness and blepharospasm and may occur even without a pre-existing history of these symptoms. [...] Tinnitus occurring during dose reduction or discontinuation of benzodiazepines is alleviated by recommencement of benzodiazepines. Dizziness is often reported as being the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> that lasts the longest.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTobacco <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> may be confounded with attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) symptoms among smokers with ADHD. Objective(1) To assess {{overlap between}} ADHD <b>symptoms</b> and tobacco/nicotine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> and craving; (2) {{to assess the}} relationship between craving or <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{and the effect of}} osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) on ADHD symptoms; (3) to assess the association of ADHD <b>symptoms,</b> craving, and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> with abstinence. MethodsSecondary analysis of a randomized, placebo controlled smoking cessation trial assessing the efficacy of OROS-MPH taken in addition to nicotine patch among individuals with ADHD. ADHD <b>symptoms,</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and craving were assessed at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 weeks after a target quit day. ResultsWithdrawal symptoms and craving showed limited and modest overlap with ADHD symptoms prior to abstinence but more extensive and stronger correlation after quit day. Compared to placebo, OROS-MPH reduced ADHD symptoms; this effect was attenuated by controlling for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> but not by craving. Craving, but not ADHD <b>symptoms</b> and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> was associated with abstinence during the trial. ConclusionWhen treating smokers with ADHD (1) craving, rather than tobacco <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> or ADHD symptoms may be the more effective therapeutic smoking cessation targets; (2) careful distinction of craving, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and ADHD <b>symptoms</b> when assessing <b>withdrawal</b> phenomena is needed...|$|R
25|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{can occur}} from {{standard}} dosages and also after short-term use, and {{can range from}} insomnia and anxiety to more serious symptoms, including seizures and psychosis. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can sometimes resemble pre-existing conditions and be misdiagnosed. Diazepam may produce less intense <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> due to its long elimination half-life.|$|R
50|$|Depersonalization {{has been}} {{described}} by some as a desirable state, particularly by those that have experienced it under the influence of mood-altering recreational drugs. It is an effect of dissociatives and psychedelics, as well as possible side effect of caffeine, alcohol, amphetamine, and cannabis. It is a classic <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> from many drugs.|$|E
50|$|Some {{drugs can}} induce blepharospasm, {{such as those}} used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as {{sensitivity}} to hormone treatments, including estrogen-replacement therapy for women going through menopause. Blepharospasm {{can also be a}} symptom of acute withdrawal from benzodiazepines. In addition to blepharospasm being a benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom,</b> prolonged use of benzodiazepines can induce blepharospasm and is a known risk factor for the development of blepharospasm.|$|E
5000|$|Certain medications, {{particularly}} contraceptive medications, can induce amenorrhoea in {{a healthy}} woman. The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and {{can take up to}} a year to resume after stopping a medication. Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen like the oral contraceptive Micronor, and especially higher-dose formulations like the injectable Depo Provera commonly induce this side-effect. Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation. Patients who use and then cease using contraceptives like the combined oral contraceptive pill may experience secondary amenorrhoea as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom.</b> The link is not well understood, as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop amenorrhoea as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> following the cessation of OCOP use and women who experience secondary amenorrhoea because of other reasons. [...] New contraceptive pills, like continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) which do not have the normal 7 days of placebo pills in each cycle, have been shown to increase rates of amenorrhoea in women. Studies show that women are most likely to experience amenorrhoea after 1 year of treatment with continuous OCP use.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{in rates}} of {{withdrawal}} (50â€“100%) {{vary depending on}} the patient sample. For example, a random sample of long-term benzodiazepine users typically finds around 50% experience few or no <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> with the other 50% experiencing notable <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Certain select patient groups show a higher rate of notable <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> up to 100%.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inhalants {{are among}} the most common and {{dangerous}} forms of substance use, but very little research on inhalant use disorders exist. Unlike other substances, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4 th edition (DSM-IV) indicates that inhalants do not have an associated withdrawal syndrome among persons who meet criteria for inhalant dependence. METHODS: Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, this study examines the prevalence of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> among inhalant users. Prevalence of inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> for inhalants was also compared with the prevalence of cocaine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> to help determine the presence of an inhalant withdrawal syndrome. RESULTS: Approximately 47. 8 % of persons who met criteria for inhalant dependence reported experiencing three or more inhalant-related <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> that were clinically significant. Among those with inhalant dependence, almost half of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> were as common as the corresponding <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> experienced by persons with cocaine dependence. Furthermore, the percentage of persons with inhalant dependence reporting clinically significant inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> was almost equal to the percentage of persons with cocaine dependence reporting clinically significant cocaine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence for an inhalant-related withdrawal syndrome among persons with inhalant dependence. Revisions to DSM-IV should consider including inhalant withdrawal as a diagnostic criterion for this disorder...|$|R
50|$|Discontinuation of {{baclofen}} can {{be associated}} with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> are more likely if baclofen is used {{for long periods of time}} (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Acute <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.|$|R

50|$|A {{protracted}} alcohol {{withdrawal syndrome}} occurs in many alcoholics where withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage but usually at a subacute level of intensity and gradually decreasing with severity over time. This syndrome is also {{sometimes referred to}} as the post-acute-withdrawal syndrome. Some withdrawal symptoms can linger {{for at least a year}} after discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms can include a craving for alcohol, inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things (also known as anhedonia), clouding of sensorium, disorientation, nausea and vomiting or headache. Insomnia is also a common protracted <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> which persists after the acute withdrawal phase of alcohol. Insomnia has also been found to influence relapse rate. Studies have found that magnesium or trazodone can help treat the persisting <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> of insomnia in recovering alcoholics. Insomnia can be difficult to treat in alcoholics because many of the traditional sleep aids (e.g. benzodiazepine receptor agonists and barbiturate receptor agonists) work via a GABAA receptor mechanism and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. However, trazodone is not cross-tolerant with alcohol. The acute phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can also occasionally be protracted. Protracted delirium tremens has been reported in the medical literature as a possible but unusual feature of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> from {{antipsychotics}} {{may emerge}} during dosage reduction and discontinuation. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can include nausea, emesis, anorexia, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis, myalgia, paresthesia, anxiety, dysphoria or depression, cognitive dysfunction, worsening of negative symptoms, agitation, restlessness, and insomnia. The psychological <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can {{be mistaken for}} a relapse of the underlying disorder.

40|$|Background: Prolonged {{administration}} of benzodiazepines and/or opioids {{to children in}} a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) may induce physiological dependence and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Objective: We reviewed the literature for relevant contributions {{on the nature of}} these <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> and on availability of valid scoring systems to assess the extent of symptoms. Methods: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Psychinfo (1980 -June 2006) were searched using relevant key terms. Results: Symptoms of benzodiazepine and opioid withdrawal can be classified in two groups: central nervous system effects and autonomic dysfunction. However, symptoms of the two types show a large overlap for benzodiazepine and opioid <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Symptoms</b> of gastrointestinal dysfunction in the PICU population have been described for opioid withdrawal only. Six assessment tools for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> are used in children. Four of these have been validated for neonates only. Two instruments are available to specifically determine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the PICU: the Sedation Withdrawal Score (SWS) and the Opioid Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Scale (OBWS). The OBWS is the only available assessment tool with prospective validation; however, the sensitivity is low. Conclusions: <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> for benzodiazepines and opioids largely overlap. A sufficiently sensitive instrument for assessing <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in PICU patients needs to be developed...|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} benzodiazepine use include drug dependence {{as well as}} the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health. Benzodiazepines are generally effective when used therapeutically in the short term. Most of the problems associated with benzodiazepines result from their long-term use. There are significant physical, mental and social risks associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines. Although anxiety can temporarily increase as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom,</b> there is evidence that a reduction or withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead in the long run to a reduction in anxiety symptoms. Due to these increasing physical and mental symptoms from long-term use of benzodiazepines, slowly withdrawing from benzodiazepines is recommended for many long-term users. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} opiate-based pain killers, chronic use of codeine can cause {{physical}} dependence.

5000|$|AMPT {{administration}} in healthy subjects has shown to cause increased sleepiness, decreased calmness, increased tension and anger, and a trend for increased depression. Sedation was also reported {{as a side}} effect of AMPT ingestion. However, sedation was not seen in AMPT doses of less than 2g per day. Patients have reported insomnia as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> post AMPT exposure. [...] When L-dopa is administered following AMPT administration, the effects of AMPT are reversed. These findings suggest that AMPT's effect on alertness and anxiety is catecholamine-specific and further supports that catecholamines are involved in the regulation of normal states of arousal and pathological anxiety symptoms. [...] Patients have reported hand, leg, and trunk tremors as well as tightening of the jaw post AMPT drug therapy. These Parkinson like side effects are supported by the lack of dopamine in the brain as in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. Tourette syndrome patients treated with AMPT developed akinesia, akathisia, and oculogyric crisis. Most severe of all, patients developed crystalluria (crystals in the urine) after undergoing AMPT drug treatments.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} plasma {{cortisol}} estimations {{have suggested that}} hypothalmo-pituitary-axis (HPA) activation occurs in alcohol-dependent patients during alcohol withdrawal. The present study set out to confirm this finding using salivary cortisol assays, which are a better indicator of plasma free cortisol, the fraction which exerts its physiological effects. Nine alcohol dependent patients provided four saliva samples (at 10 a. m., 2 p. m., 6 p. m. and 10 p. m.) on days 1, 3 and 7 of a medically assisted alcohol withdrawal (corresponding to 1, 3 and 7 days following the last drink, respectively). <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, craving and mood disturbance were also measured. A group of non-alcohol-dependent individuals, without psychiatric or medical disorder, gave four samples at the same times on one day only. Mean daily cortisol levels in our alcohol-dependent population, as calculated by the area under the curve (AUC), decreased significantly over time (mean AUC (nmol/l/hour) on day 1 = 149, on day 7 = 85. 7, p = 0. 009) and {{were significantly higher than}} controls on each day (mean AUC in controls = 28. 3, p = 0. 001). The cortisol response showed a similar temporal trend to <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and mood disturbance. This is consistent with previous studies measuring plasma cortisol in alcohol withdrawal. However, the magnitude of the effect in our study was greater, and in contrast to some previous studies, levels were far from normal by day 7. The comparatively low cortisol response in our one mildly dependent patient suggests {{that there may be a}} relationship between dependence severity and the size of the cortisol response to withdrawal. Salivary cortisol sampling could prove to be a useful prognostic tool, with implications for subsequent <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, mood disturbances, risk of relapse and alcohol-related cognitive decline. There are implications for developing new treatments for alcohol withdrawal but more studies are needed...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundChronic {{exposure}} to nicotine elicits physical dependence in smokers, yet the mechanism and neuroanatomical bases for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> are unclear. As in humans, rodents undergo physical <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> after cessation from chronic nicotine characterized by increased scratching, head nods, and body shakes. ResultsHere {{we show that}} induction of physical nicotine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> activates GABAergic neurons within the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Optical activation of IPN GABAergic neurons via light stimulation of channelrhodopsin elicited physical <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in both nicotine-naive and chronic-nicotine-exposed mice. Dampening excitability of GABAergic neurons during nicotine withdrawal through IPN-selective infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist or through blockade of IPN neurotransmission from the medial habenula reduced IPN neuronal activation and alleviated <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> During chronic nicotine exposure, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing the Î² 4 subunit were upregulated in somatostatin interneurons clustered in the dorsal region of the IPN. Blockade of these receptors induced withdrawal signs more dramatically in nicotine-dependent compared to nicotine-naive mice and activated nonsomatostatin neurons in the IPN. ConclusionsTogether, our data indicate that therapeutic strategies to reduce IPN GABAergic neuron excitability during nicotine withdrawal, for example, by activating nicotinic receptors on somatostatin interneurons, may be beneficial for alleviating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> and facilitating smoking cessation...|$|R
