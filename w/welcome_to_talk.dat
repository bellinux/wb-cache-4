50|$|During the {{production}} of the film some Ukrainian actors, invited to play characters, rejected the offer after reading about them. They refused because they thought the movie propagates hate.

50|$|Nuccio {{was also}} known for his {{unconventional}} governing style and unusual daily schedule. He regularly ate a breakfast of toasted Cuban bread and Café con leche at a small cafe in West Tampa, sometimes moving on to another cafe in Ybor City later in the morning. Constituents were <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> sit and <b>talk</b> with the mayor about their issues in English, Spanish, or Italian, and they often left with a promise of help from the city. These conversations could continue into lunchtime, which Nuccio usually ate in his own home, often bringing home visitors to share his wife's home-cooked meal. After lunch, Nuccio often enjoyed a short nap at home, after which the mayor would finally arrive at his downtown office, where he would stay late into the evening.|$|R

50|$|Derm calls Saxon {{to reveal}} that they've {{discovered}} his wife's body. Depressed, Saxon <b>welcomes</b> the chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Costas again. They discuss how traumatic events can lead to inappropriate guilt, and Costas convinces Saxon {{to allow him to}} speak to the police, on his behalf. However, the police reveal that they have not discovered the wife's body, after all, leading both Costas and Derm to suspect Saxon. Saxon has further hallucinations, leading him to suspect himself, as well. Simian, who had been arrested previously for assaulting Saxon, returns to Saxon's house again, enraged and seeking to kill Saxon. Saxon instead kills Simian, and, consumed with guilt, swallows every pill that he can find. Derm, arriving at the house afterward, kneels down, in front of Saxon, while Saxon denies killing anyone. The bathtub then overflows with blood, and Saxon sees his wife playing the piano.|$|R
5000|$|Wexler {{believes}} {{that people who}} come for presymptomatic testing will benefit from intensive counseling, sometimes {{in lieu of the}} test itself. Her beliefs regarding counseling stem from her own experience regarding presymptomatic testing and also talking with colleagues in other programs. Being at risk has {{had a profound effect on}} most people’s lives. They may have had an ill parent, with whom they may or may not have had contact, and perhaps other relatives who have suffered from HD. Almost all <b>welcome</b> the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with someone knowledgeable about the experience that they are going through. Wexler states that, “The genetic test gives people a crystal ball to see the future: will the city be free of bombs from now on or will a bomb crash into their home, killing them and jeopardizing their children?” ...|$|R

40|$|Chairman Ney {{and members}} of the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee, I <b>welcome</b> this {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you about reform of the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

I have been involved in housing policy analysis since the late 1960 s.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{qualitative}} study exploring women's experiences of domestic violence before, during and after pregnancy. The research employed a qualitative framework underpinned by feminist and phenomenological values and philosophy. Feminism and phenomenology were integrated in order to strengthen the philosophical foundation {{in an attempt to}} gain a richer and deeper understanding of the human lived experience. Data were collected from seventeen interviews undertaken with eleven women who had been pregnant in the previous two years, using unstructured interviews. The interviews focused on the participants’ unique accounts, appreciating their different experiences and interpretations of living with domestic violence. Thematic analysis of the data was used to identify common themes. Findings suggest the women <b>welcomed</b> the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their own personal experiences of violence, which they believed had been triggered by their pregnancy. Only two pregnancies were planned, with almost a third of the women being coerced into motherhood by their partner. Feelings of vulnerability about themselves and their unborn babies were intensified by their partners’ continuing violence and abuse. Responsive service developments were also explored in the interviews. The women described what they would have found helpful, from healthcare professionals and services during their pregnancies...|$|R
