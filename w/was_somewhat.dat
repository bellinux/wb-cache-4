5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Clemson was No. 10 in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 236.4 per game. Its passing offense <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> weaker, ranked No. 63 and averaging 210.1 yards per game. In total, however, Clemson's offense ranked No. 10 {{when the two}} amounts were added together. In scoring offense, the Tigers averaged 36.0 points per game, good enough for No. 14 {{in the country in}} that category.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} into the element <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project. Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Furtwangler {{notes that}} as the series grew, this plan <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> changed.

5|$|Leading the 2007 Longhorns, McCoy <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> less consistent. Through {{the first}} five games he threw nine interceptions—two more than he threw in the entire 2006 season. He went on to throw 18 interceptions during the 2007 season.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{were widely}} varied for the episode: some {{felt it was}} the best of the third season to date, and others were quite critical, though the overall mix <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> more {{positive}} than negative. A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes have tended to be light on plot, though several felt that this episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Blount responded {{fairly well}} to the suspension, {{improving}} his attendance in both academic and athletic pursuits. He was reinstated by newly appointed head coach Chip Kelly in March. He attended some, but not all, voluntary workouts during the off-season, but was praised for an improved attitude by fellow members of the football program. He arrived at training camp in better physical shape than in 2008. At , he <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> above his optimal weight, but was slimming down, and aiming for a 2,000 yard season.

5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

The PS2 version, and later the PlayStation Portable (PSP) version, both had the sexual content removed, and in these versions {{there is no evidence}} that physical relationships actually take place between any of the students.|$|E

5|$|It was {{designed}} to replace the galleys {{that made up the}} core of the fleets that operated along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E

He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E

The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance, encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She <b>was</b> <b>somewhat</b> gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E
