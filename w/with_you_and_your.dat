25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States and I look forward to working <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as you prepare to assume the presidency.|$|E
25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after, he {{had moved}} in with the family of his close friend, Ronnie Burns, who became a pop star: first {{as a member of}} The Flies (1964–65) and then as a solo artist. Meldrum had {{followed}} Burns to the latter's home and asked, [...] "Is there any chance I could come and live <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family?" [...] What had started as a two-week stay with the Burns family became nine years. During The Beatles' tour of Australia in June 1964, Meldrum was captured by TV cameras climbing atop the bonnet of their car shortly after arrival at Melbourne airport. Later, he and Burns were ejected from The Beatles' Melbourne concert for being [...] "too enthusiastic".|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{opposition}} to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. Once there, Ibraham would call out to passersby, [...] "Who will buy my idols? They will not help you and they cannot hurt you! Who will buy my idols?" [...] Then Ibrahim would mock the idols. He would {{take them to the}} river, push their faces into the water and command them, [...] "Drink! Drink!" [...] Once again, Ibrahim asked his father, [...] "How can you worship what does not see or hear or do you any good?" [...] Azar replied, [...] "Dare you deny the gods of our people? Get out of my sight!" [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "May God forgive you. No more will I live <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> idols." [...] After this, Ibrahim left his father's home for good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your majesty {{will find}} him a very {{attentive}} and faithful servant," [...] said Stein. [...] "He will remain <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> administer <b>your</b> medicine at proper intervals." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{heart was}} beating fast, but she bravely faced him. [...] "Yes, Mart, I don't feel right living <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{spending}} <b>your</b> money the way I've been doing." ...|$|R
60|$|Bel. She's {{provided}} for with a familiar too: One {{that is in}} this very room <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> by <b>your</b> elbow; but I'll shew you him some other time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor we," [...] said I earnestly; [...] "for our greatly desired {{acquaintance}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> {{family could}} not have begun too soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give {{me those}} jewels and all may yet be well <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> mistress, vile witches though you are. If not, you burn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As he, Lord, {{who does}} not forget, has an account to settle <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> servant, Light-in-Darkness," [...] commented Harût in an {{unpleasant}} and suggestive tone.|$|E

6000|$|... "'May God be <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Macassar Jones,' said he, as {{he walked}} out of the office door with his {{coloured}} bandana pressed to his eyes. 'May God be <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> make <b>your</b> bed fruitful!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{retorted}} Oliver, [...] "only {{put me in}} command, with an auger, and I'll {{navigate the}} ship {{to the bottom of}} the sea, <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> all <b>your</b> cowardly crew on board of her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{interfere}} with my sister, I'll call an officer," [...] Norman threatened. [...] "She {{does not wish}} to speak <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> insistence is insult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do think}} that is nonsense." [...] She only smiled and shook her head. [...] "Then the Senator shall go in the phaeton, and I will go <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strangely mistaken again!" [...] murmured the hermit. [...] "Who {{can know}} the {{workings}} of the human mind! Self was mixed with my feelings-- profoundly--yet my sympathy <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> mother was sincere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How now, Father Crackenthorp?' said Ewart--'Why this hurry {{with your}} horses? We mean {{to stay a}} night <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> taste <b>your</b> old brandy, <b>and</b> my dame's homebrewed. The signal is up, man, and all is right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} said you were going to wear your gray gown all day to-morrow on your trip to Yalbury, and in the evening too, when I shall be <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> ask <b>your</b> father for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, father, dinner's ready. Now then, you children, {{get along}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> wash <b>your</b> hands all of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> don't shirk it, because I mean {{to look at}} them before you have a scrap of dinner, so there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{gives me}} pleasure, sir," [...] said she, [...] "to meet <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> wife. It is so seldom {{that we find}} any one--" [...] She was {{interrupted}} by Mrs. Perkenpine, who stood behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] Van Voorden said, [...] "and {{it will be}} {{far more}} {{pleasant}} to be <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good wife than in a strange place. How about the horses, of which we have six?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil {{fly away}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> {{woman with the}} knife! There isn't a mark in the bedclothes anywhere. What {{do you mean by}} coming into a man's place and {{frightening}} his family out of their wits about a dream?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose Cecily {{goes down}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> coaxes <b>your</b> mother," [...] {{suggested}} the Story Girl. [...] "Perhaps she'd {{let you go}} then. She likes Cecily. She doesn't like either Felicity or me, so it would only make matters worse for us to try." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Do {{not hurt}} me and punish me--Oh, do not! I couldn't help coming; it was killing me. Last night, {{when you did}} not come back, I could not bear it--I could not! Only let me be <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> see <b>your</b> face, Harry; I don't ask for more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Smithers {{will tell}} you that I had {{intended}} to leave you my intire [...] fortune. I have this morning, in his presents, solamly toar up my [...] will; and hereby renounce all connection <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> beggarly [...] family.|$|E
6000|$|... "My feet--hurt so--" [...] sobbed Rilla {{clinging}} to the last shred of her pride. It was less humiliating to admit crying because of your feet than because--because somebody had been amusing himself <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friends had forgotten you, and other people patronized you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To the Devil <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> prison,' {{retorted}} Rigaud, leisurely, as he {{took from}} his pocket a case containing the materials for making cigarettes, and employed his facile hands in folding a few for present use; 'I care for neither of you.

6000|$|... "I trust," [...] he said, [...] "that this pint bottle {{does not}} {{represent}} your cellar.

6000|$|... "And {{keep the}} {{left-hand}} channel till you're past the bend," [...] Jacob Welse counselled him; [...] "then take the cut-offs {{to the right}} and follow the swiftest water.
