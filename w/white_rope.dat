25|$|Numerous bands {{have found}} their names in Burroughs's work. The most widely known of these is Steely Dan, a group named after a dildo in Naked Lunch. Also from Naked Lunch came the names Clarknova, The Mugwumps and The Insect Trust. The novel Nova Express {{inspired}} the names of Grant Hart's post-Hüsker Dü band Nova Mob, as well as Australian 1960s R band Nova Express. British band Soft Machine took its moniker from the Burroughs novel of the same name. Alt-country band Clem Snide is named for a Burroughs character. Thin <b>White</b> <b>Rope</b> took their name from Burroughs's euphemism for ejaculation.|$|E

But he still moved on searchingly, hardly heeding certain spectral imps other than Aphroditean, who always haunted these places, and jeeringly pointed out that under the white hair of this or that ribanded old man, with a forehead grown wrinkled over treaties which had swayed the fortunes of Europe, with a voice which had numbered sovereigns among its respectful listeners, might be a heart that would go inside a nut-shell; that beneath this or that <b>white</b> <b>rope</b> of pearl and pink bosom, might lie the half-lung which had, by hook or by crook, to sustain its possessor above-ground till the wedding-day.|$|E

[...] The black and <b>white</b> <b>ropes</b> that appear to form spirals are in fact concentric circles. The mid-twentieth century Op art or optical art style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen {{in the work of}} artists such as Bridget Riley, Spyros Horemis, and Victor Vasarely.|$|R

The sea came and went among the rocks below, marking its course in the {{deepening}} twilight with a <b>white</b> <b>rope</b> of foam, and raving huskily to itself, with now and then the long plunge of some heavier surge against the bowlders, and a hoarse shout. The Portland boat swam by in the offing, a glitter of irregular lights, and the lamps on the different points of the Cape blinked as they revolved in their towers.

60|$|On lofty ground, in {{the midst}} of a paradise of {{tropical}} foliage and flowers, remote from the world and its turmoil and noise, they stood--the Towers of Silence; and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoa palms, then the city, mile on mile, then the ocean with its fleets of creeping ships all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that hallowed this high place of the dead. The vultures were there. They stood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a massive low tower--waiting; stood as motionless as sculptured ornaments, and indeed almost deceived one into the belief that that was what they were. Presently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present, and all moved reverently out of the path and ceased from talking. A funeral procession entered the great gate, marching two and two, and moved silently by, toward the Tower. The corpse lay in a shallow shell, and was under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise naked. The bearers of the body were separated by an interval of thirty feet from the mourners. They, and also the mourners, were draped all in pure white, and each couple of mourners was figuratively bound together by a piece of <b>white</b> <b>rope</b> or a handkerchief--though they merely held the ends of it in their hands. Behind the procession followed a dog, which was led in a leash. When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the Tower --neither they nor any other human being but the bearers of the dead must approach within thirty feet of it--they turned and went back to one of the prayer-houses within the gates, to pray for the spirit of their dead. The bearers unlocked the Tower's sole door and disappeared from view within. In a little while they came out bringing the bier and the white covering-cloth, and locked the door again. Then the ring of vultures rose, flapping their wings, and swooped down into the Tower to devour the body. Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when they flocked-out again a few minutes afterward.|$|E

5000|$|The ball is yellow wool, from 22 to 23 grams {{in weight}} and from 5 to 5.5 cm in diameter. A {{standard}} ball-badminton racket usually weighs from 200 to 250 grams and is 63 to 70 cm in length. The strung oval {{area of the}} racket should be 20 to 22 across and 24 to 27 cm in length. The net is made of fine cord to make a 2 cm square mesh along its length and is edged with red tape at the top. The entire net is red, white and blue, 100 cm wide and 13.5 meters in length. It is tied to a center pole of 183 cm and two poles of 185 cm {{at the sides of}} the court to maintain the 183 cm height of the net at the center. Two posts, each 2 meters high, are fixed one meter or less outside the court on either side {{at the end of the}} line to which the net is tied, strong enough to keep the net well stretched. A hook is fixed at 1.5 meters height to each pole to easily tighten the net whenever necessary.The size of the court for [...] "fives" [...] teams is 12 metres wide and 24 metres long. It is divided across the middle by a net line over which the net is hung, the ends of which are attached to the tops of the two posts. The serving crease lines are drawn one meter away from each side of the net line and parallel to it. The center line is drawn halfway between the serving crease lines and parallel to the sidelines; this divides the space on each side of the crease line into two halves, known as the right and left courts. The boundary lines are marked with <b>white</b> <b>ropes,</b> 5 mm thick. The center and crease lines are to be marked so as to be visible, about 10 mm wide ...|$|R

They had burst the windows of her blindness. When she crawled into the green-brown covert it was to escape too great perception. She needed to be encompassed by close, tangible things. And there her body paid the tribute to the realization of life. Shock, convulsion, pain, relaxation, and then unutterable and insupportable sensing of her environment and the heart! In one way she was a wild animal alone in the woods, forced into the mating that meant reproduction of its kind. In another she was an infinitely higher being shot through and through with the most resistless and mysterious transport that life could give to flesh.|$|R

The Council returns and reviews Fiona's transgressions. They order that Fiona abdicate her Supremacy, and the Council will rule until the new Supreme reveals herself. Fiona refuses, and accuses Myrtle (Frances Conroy) of the acid attack on Cordelia. Fiona sees Myrtle under the black hood in the hospital under woozy flashback. She also accuses Myrtle of killing Madison, saying she was in town when it happened, surprising the Council. Fiona reveals she and Spalding had tracked down Myrtle under an alias to a hotel, finding pictures of her taped all over the walls with pentagrams drawn on them. Myrtle objects that Fiona has to be stopped {{and they think that}} sounds like a confession. Fiona pulls off Myrtle's gloves to reveal her acid-burned hands.

50|$|As of August 3, 2012, {{the show}} has used the {{modified}} WWE HD universal set, which debuted at Raw 1000 on July 23. From September 21, 2012 until October 26, 2012, October 4, 2013 until November 1, 2013, October 3 and 31, 2014 and October 2 and 30, 2015, WWE worked in conjunction with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to raise awareness for breast cancer by adorning the SmackDown set with pink ribbons and a special pink middle-rope in the ring. SmackDowns ring ropes were usually blue from 1999-2012 (although they were black for a period between 2001 and 2002). They remained blue until December 2012 when they were permanently changed to white, with all WWE programming now using <b>white</b> ring <b>ropes.</b> On August 22, 2014, SmackDown switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, with a down-scaled version of the native HD feed on a 4:3 SD feed. Like Raw (which also switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation four days earlier on August 18), the new WWE logo is seen on the rings turnbuckle covers and also, on the lower-right hand corner of the screen. On August 29, 2014, the Syfy network logo moved to the lower left-hand corner of the screen.|$|R

It were difficult to say which most engaged his thoughts: the profile; the lovely line of neck; or the rope of pearls. These latter were of price, such things as it might seldom--and then only by sacrifice--lie within the means of Captain Tremayne to offer to the woman whom he took to wife.|$|R
