40|$|In addition, {{studies on}} motor {{preparation}} {{have shown that}} the instruction to later execute a particular movement results in increased activation of brain areas such as dorsal pre-motor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M 1) (Riehle and Requin, 1989; Toni et al., 1999; Crammond and Kalaska, 2000; Cisek et al., 2003; Zang et al., 2003; Churchland et al., 2006). Instruction-related changes in activation have also been found in the thalamus (Michelon et al., 2006), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Nagai et al., 2004), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; Ikeda et al., 1996), and the putamen (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Jaeger et al., 1993). Interestingly, single-cell recordings showed that cortical activation precedes activation in the putamen, suggesting that the preparatory activity in the putamen might be caused by input from M 1 and SMA (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Mink, 1996). Here we present an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in people were given cues that provided probabilis-tic information about the direction of movement of an upcoming random dot display (i. e., 90 %, 70 %, or 50 % valid).
