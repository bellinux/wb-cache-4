The singer said the lyrical content is about {{survival}} and {{knowing what to do}} when something goes wrong.

[...] When asked if the lyrics were regarding a drinking problem, Clarkson responded, [...] "I'm not an alcoholic; that's not what it's about. It's just a metaphor. Everyone has something they are addicted to that they can do without in their life, so it could be about <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> addiction is." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1870 he was {{appointed}} a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and retired from his government post. Crease was suspicious of both Confederation and responsible government, largely because they threatened greater government control over judges and central Canadian domination of patronage. Like many British Columbians, he was disappointed that London seemed to {{have given up on}} BC as an independent colony, abandoning either it to annexation to the United States or confederation with Canada. [...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – is to lose Caste the moment you become a bona fide settler." [...] Regardless of his opposition to Confederation, Crease was chosen to prepare for it as the chair of the Royal Commission for the Revision of Laws of BC.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how you prove what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way".

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure your excellency that <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt [...] "justifies having an interest in <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> boyfriend likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of Many Faces as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E
2500|$|The title 10,000 Days {{refers to}} roughly the orbital {{period of the}} planet Saturn (actual time period is 10,759 days), which adds up to nearly 29 years and marks, {{according}} to Keenan, [...] "the time when you are presented the opportunity to transform from <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> hang-ups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load, so to speak, and let go of old patterns and embrace a new life." [...] Keenan expected that the songs composed would [...] "chronicle that process, hoping that my gift back would be to share that path and hope that I could help somebody get past that spot." [...] It is rumoured that the album is a reference to Maynard James Keenan's mother who was paralyzed for 10,000 days (27 years) before she died.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with The Observer, Kaplický said: [...] "The {{world is full}} of beautiful things, {{and you have to be}} observant as an architect – if not, you are in trouble. Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then you are on the right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or <b>whatever.</b> <b>Your</b> personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{began its}} interrogations on May 27, 1920. Dean Greenough summoned each witness {{with a brief}} note, for example: [...] "I expect you, <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> {{engagement}} may be, to appear at my office tomorrow, Friday, May 28th, at 2:45 P.M." [...] Another even said: [...] "If necessary you are directed to cut a final examination {{in order to keep}} this appointment." [...] Only the Court's notes survive, not transcripts, so it is difficult to ascertain the tenor of the exchanges, whether these were conversations, interviews, or interrogations, or perhaps changed in the course of each session. Clearly the Court pressed witnesses and challenged them with conflicting facts, since the Court's notes record admissions followed by attempts to recant, as well as denials followed by admissions. For example, the Court's note for Harold Saxton says [...] "when pushed he practically confessed to one act, but later retracted." [...] And Kenneth Day [...] "confessed to H.S. [...] relations with Roberts, after denial at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{scored the}} soundtrack 3 out of 5, writing [...] "True Crime is {{something}} of an achievement when it comes to gathering popular music in support of a video game." [...] She concluded [...] "It's not a perfect soundtrack, but True Crime is entertaining enough to please gaming and non-gaming rap fans alike." [...] IGN's Spence D scored the soundtrack 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Where The Streets of LA: The Soundtrack really succeeds is {{in the fact that the}} 20 track album features all new material written specifically for the game." [...] He concluded [...] "The most interesting thing is that for all intents and purposes the West Coast gangsta scene, musically speaking, has more or less run its course, succumbing to the bling and blitz of the Dirty South. But this album proves that it's still alive and well. <b>Whatever</b> <b>your</b> take on the gunz-n-thugs mentality may be, one thing can't be denied: the 20 tracks included here are rife with game, style, and serious funktafication." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{his show}} Lou Dobbs Tonight, Dobbs {{stopped short of}} a full {{endorsement}} of Presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying, [...] "Whatever you think of Trump, <b>whatever</b> <b>your</b> politics, Trump has taken on enormous risk and threats in seeking the presidency ... promised to restore {{the voice of the}} people ... and a government that will respect all that our Constitution assures." [...] Dobbs has since endorsed Donald Trump. In October 2017, Dobbs said that the Trump presidency [...] "may be the most accomplished in modern American history." [...] Trump praised Dobbs in return. Later that month, Dobbs interviewed Trump, with numerous observers describing Dobbs's interview style as fawning and sycophantic. Dobbs opened the interview with [...] "You have accomplished so much", and later said to Trump that he was “one of the most loved and respected” presidents “in history.” The New York Times described the interview as a love-fest and [...] "courtier-like session", as Dobbs [...] "didn’t so much ask questions as open his mouth and let rose petals fall out".|$|E
