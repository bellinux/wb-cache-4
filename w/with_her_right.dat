5|$|While Queen Maya {{felt that}} it was the time to give birth, she went to the Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha.

5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali {{with her left}} foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E

5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple {{may have been}} consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of Uma Mahesvara (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, she stood in the alidha pose, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta {{stands in a}} fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E

Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book {{on her knees and}} representing History. There is a bronze plaque showing a battle scene, another featuring an inscription, and others naming the 1190 officers and enlisted men who died in battle.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 1937, Smith was {{critically}} {{injured in}} a car crash while traveling along U.S. Route 61 between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.|$|E
25|$|Picasso's Landscape with Two Figures {{is almost}} entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its {{reduction}} to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-Nabis post-Symbolist treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all depth of field. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects {{in front of others}} obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand.|$|E

25|$|She was {{the first}} woman to score both a test century and a One Day International century for the Kiwis. Her test hundred came against India in Dunedin in 1976-77 while her one-day {{international}} century came against the International XI in the 1982 World Cup, when she put on 180 with Lesley Murdoch.She also set the record for becoming the oldest woman to score her maiden ODI hundred in Women's ODI history(at the age of 39 years and 48 days) She scored 400 runs in Test match cricket at the excellent average of 44.44. In 16 One Day Internationals from 1973 to 1982 she scored 488 runs at 32.53. She also took 3 for 17 against Australia <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm medium pace, her only ODI wickets.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their lateralization to the right hemisphere. They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hemisphere, they thought her language functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E
25|$|Sky Blue FC {{began their}} first WPS {{campaign}} on April 5, in a match against the Los Angeles Sol at TD Bank Ballpark. A first-half brace by Marta led the Sol to a 2–0 win. Six days later, Sky Blue FC hosted FC Gold Pride. Rampone, the team's regular captain, missed the match {{due to an}} injury. In the 76th minute, O'Reilly scored on a strike <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> foot for the club's first-ever goal, which was enough for a 1–1 draw. Following that match, which was their last at TD Bank Ballpark, Sky Blue FC embarked on a five-match stretch on the road. Against the Chicago Red Stars on April 19, goalkeepers Karen Bardsley and Jenni Branam combined for six saves in a scoreless draw. Collette McCallum had a scoring opportunity for Sky Blue FC in the first half, but her effort went off the crossbar.|$|E

25|$|Juan Vucetich, an Argentine chief police officer, {{created the}} first method of {{recording}} the fingerprints of individuals on file, associating these fingerprints to the anthropometric system of Alphonse Bertillon, who had created, in 1879, a system to identify individuals by anthropometric photographs and associated quantitative descriptions. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of Necochea, {{was found in a}} house with neck injuries, whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder shows the Christ child twisting his body away from his mother’s embrace, his eye caught by her yarnwinder whose spokes give it {{the shape of a}} cross; he precociously recognises it as a symbol of his destiny. The Virgin’s reaction is ambiguous, a mixture of alarm at the harm her son will come to and resigned acceptance of it. The gesture of suspense made <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> hand is repeated from Leonardo’s Milanese altarpiece The Virgin of the Rocks. The use of a symbol of the Passion as an object of childish play recurs throughout Leonardo’s painted oeuvre, appearing for instance in the Benois Madonna and the Virgin and Child with St Anne. As with later works by Leonardo, the figures appear in a vast unpopulated landscape. The rocky outcrop in the foreground of the Buccleuch Madonna is painted with a minute attention to geological detail.|$|E
