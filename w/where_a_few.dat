5|$|A {{bumblebee}} (also written bumble bee) is {{a member}} of the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species of bumblebee are known. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, Psithyrus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus.|$|E

Transoceanic journeys also occur: a bird that was caught and ringed in Labrador, Canada, was shot by a hunter in England nine days later, and Japanese-ringed birds have been recovered from six US states east to Utah and Mississippi. In parts of the range, such as Great Britain and the northwestern United States, the pintail may be present all year.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} {{imperial}} fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions {{in exchange for}} the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession {{in the same way as}} his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E

25|$|Nest mates must {{communicate}} with each other in order to perform necessary tasks such as nest building and foraging. Some colonies have diffuse connections where each individual is just as likely to interact with any other.

Polistes instabilis is an example of these types of colonies, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dominant workers seem to induce others to forage.

25|$|The Oaxaca {{version of}} alebrijes differ {{not only by}} being smaller and carved from wood, but the figures {{generally}} are more recognizable as a single animal such as lions, jaguars, iguanas, dragons, dogs, snakes, rather than an amalgam of various animal parts.

The first to develop Oaxaca alebrijes was Manuel Jiménez Ramírez of Arrazola, who created them for over thirty years before his death, using soft copal wood which is still preferred. He then painted them in bright colors and with intricate designs. He was followed by Santos Pinos and then the craft spread to others in the town.

25|$|Afterwards Dashwood took eight American merchantmen, and on 15 June 1812, he {{captured}} the Hope, a merchant ship off {{the north of}} Gothland. On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus. After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At {{the review of the}} fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, he steered the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on to deck. In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He assumed the rank of vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. Charles died while at service, on 21 September 1847. Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.|$|E

On 9 June, his aircraft suffered engine failure and was damaged during a crash landing at the forward operating base ashore. On 13 June, he was the first member of the RAF to launch a laser-guided bomb (LGB), with the target being illuminated by Major Mike Howes, in combat on Mount Longdon flying a Harrier GR3 with No. 1(F) Squadron. Four Harriers from his squadron of ten were lost, three to ground fire and one after an engine failure led to a heavy landing. His squadron was also the first to operate in a combat role from a British aircraft carrier since the Second World War. Later in the year he was forced to eject on 6 November near Cape Pembroke in the Falklands due to a Harrier's engine failure.|$|E
25|$|On 21st July 1964 afternoon, about 20,000 Malays {{representing}} the different Muslim organisations in Singapore had {{gathered for the}} procession to begin to mark the birthday celebrations of Prophet Mohammad. The procession started at Padang and was planned to end at the Jamiyah Headquarters located at Lorong 12, Geylang area. The dominant narration of the July 1964 Racial riot on public forums and history textbooks is simplified and remembered as a riot which involved 20,000 Chinese throwing bottles and rocks at the Malays at the Padang. In reality, some scholars argue that the bottles and rocks being overthrown and clash with a Malay policeman who tried to restrain the Malays were not {{the reasons for the}} cause of the riots. But rather, part of the reasons could be also attributed to the distribution of leaflets to the Malay community {{before the start of the}} procession by a group named Pertobohan Perjuangan Kebangsan Melayu Singapore. The leaflets instigated anti-Chinese and anti-PAP sentiments among the Malays as it called for a greater union of the Malays to oppose and wipe out the Chinese as they were believed to be starting a ploy to kill the Malays. SUMO’s (Singapore Malay National Organisation) Secretary-General Syed Esa Almenoar had given a fiery speech on the need for the Malay community to fight for their rights instead of giving a religious and non-political speech. This further heightened the suspicions that the Malays had toward the PAP and the Chinese community. The procession was being led by Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Yusof bin Ishak and other PAP political leaders such as Othman Wok. The procession went along Arab Street, Kallang and Geylang areas. The riots occurred around 5pm <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Malay youths were seen to be hitting a Chinese cyclist along Victoria Street which was intervened by a Chinese constable. Mr Othman Wok in his autobiography recounted that while he and his team were along Lorong 14, a group of Youths were believed to be from UMNO shouted to strike the Chinese and these youths were seen to be marching in front of Wok’s contingent. The riots which occurred around Victoria and Geylang had spread to other parts of Singapore such as Palmer road and Madras Street. The police force, military and the Gurkha battalion were activated to curb the violence and at 9.30p.m, a curfew was imposed whereby everyone was ordered to stay at home. The riot saw serious damages to the private properties, loss of lives and injuries sustained by the citizens. According to the reports from the police force, a total of 220 incidents were recorded with 4 being killed and 178 people having sustained some injuries. Furthermore, a close to 20 shophouses owned by the Chinese around Geylang and Jalan Eunos regions were being burnt. The curfew was lifted at 6a.m on 22 July 1964 and the curfew was being re-imposed at 11.30 a.m as the clashes and tensions between the Malays and Chinese had not subsided.|$|E
