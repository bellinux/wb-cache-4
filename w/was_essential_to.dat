5|$|The {{availability}} {{of water to}} transport products and raw materials, and as a resource used {{in the manufacture of}} paper, <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the historical development of paper mills in the area. Bradbourne stream, which meanders through the parish in a south-east to north-west direction, rises in East Malling, crosses under the A20 road and M20 motorway, and joins the river Medway near the Aylesford Newsprint site. Historically the {{availability of}} running water <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the early settlements that grew up in Kent, and to the establishment of industries in the area; such as providing power to drive the mills which ground grain.|$|E
5|$|The colonial outpost was a {{traditional}} New England subsistence farming community. The majority of Deerfield's settlers were young families {{with women who}} had moved west in the search of land.

5|$|A quick peace <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> keep Russia from {{entering}} the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E

5|$|Clementine cake {{is related}} to a type of orange cake {{developed}} by the Sephardic Jews. The Sephardic Jewish community <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the origins of citrus cultivation in the Mediterranean in the 15th century and popularized the use of orange in baked goods. In addition to its Iberian flavors, the cake also has North African and Spanish roots.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} marriage, Anne Boleyn {{was able to}} grant petitions, receive diplomats and give patronage, and had {{enormous}} influence over her future husband to plead the cause of foreign diplomats. The ambassador from Milan wrote in 1531 that it <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> have her approval if one wanted to influence the English government, a view corroborated by an earlier French ambassador in 1529.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2008, Russia {{announced}} that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov {{said that a}} military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> prevent Georgia from regaining control. Georgia considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russian-occupied territories. In November 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied Georgian territories.|$|E

Mandel and Pierre Frank appraised the Algerian {{revolution and}} surmised that it <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> reorient {{in the colonial}} states and neocolonies towards the emerging guerrilla-led revolutions. According to Robert Alexander, Ernest Mandel has written that an organisation in Indonesia, the Partai Acoma, was affiliate to the FI from 1959 until the 1965 coup in that country.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> both sides. The {{loss of the}} stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would {{significantly}} reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> avoid further rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{the process of}} analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture {{was expected to be}} outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Romanticism {{initiated}} a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer inspired contemporary poets (such as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Keats, Byron and Shelley) and painters (such as Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema). Christoph Gluck, Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others set Greek mythological themes to music. American authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, held that the study of the classical myths <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the understanding of English and American literature. In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by dramatists Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in Britain and by novelists such as James Joyce and André Gide.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneous {{to these}} developments, Nagavarma II wrote his Kannada grammar Karnataka bhashabhushana ("Ornament of Karnataka language", 1042 or 1145). A {{milestone}} {{in the history}} of Kannada literature, it helped consolidate the language as competitor to established languages such as Sanskrit and Prakrit, bringing the local language within the realm of literary cosmopolitanism. Writing a Kannada grammar in Sanskrit language <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> Nagavarma II, a subtle rebuttal to Sanskritic scholars of the day who may have considered Kannada a language of the common man and its grammar as underdeveloped. In addition to the Chalukya patronage, Kannada poets and writers of this period were popular in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western Deccan. The Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris, the Seunas, the Gangas and the Silharas are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.|$|E
5|$|Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when Osroes I of Parthia (r. c.109–128AD) deposed the Armenian king Tiridates and {{replaced}} him with Axidares, son of Pacorus II, without consulting Rome. The Roman emperor Trajan (r.98–117AD) had the next Parthian nominee for the throne, Parthamasiris, killed in 114AD, instead making Armenia a Roman province. His forces, led by Lusius Quietus, also captured Nisibis; its occupation <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> securing {{all the major}} routes across the northern Mesopotamian plain. The following year, Trajan invaded Mesopotamia and met little resistance from only Meharaspes of Adiabene, since Osroes was engaged {{in a civil war}} to the east with Vologases III of Parthia. Trajan spent the winter of 115–116 at Antioch, but resumed his campaign in the spring. Marching down the Euphrates, he captured Dura-Europos, the capital Ctesiphon and Seleucia, and even subjugated Characene, where he watched ships depart to India from the Persian Gulf.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Philipp {{attended}} the 4. Volksschule (Pestalozzischule—4th elementary school) in Meissen. Philipp {{was a very}} good student. His mother understood that education <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> Philipp's future. She worked very hard to raise the funds to pay for higher education in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1927, she managed to have Philipp admitted to the Franziskaneum in Meissen, the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule to achieve the Abitur (university entry qualification)—in Meissen. Alma, desperate to secure her son's schooling, wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking if the school fees could be waived.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E
5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when he thought he <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{the future of the}} firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
