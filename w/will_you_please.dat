500|$|In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in {{the midst}} of a legal battle with the former {{directors}} of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced H.M.S. Pinafore. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: [...] "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor... and [...] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> let me have them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent you set." ...|$|E

One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
