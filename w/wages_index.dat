40|$|The study {{raises the}} problem of nonrandom {{distribution}} of unobservable skills across the population of a transition country. At the beginning of transition, people who grew up under different political regimes have different goals, moral norms, tastes, behavioral patterns, and motivation, resulting in earnings depending on cohort. Cohort effects are separated in two ways. In the first way, the logarithm of the real <b>wages</b> <b>index</b> is used to proxy the current period.

We discuss how the model has performed from 1994 to 2009 and estimate the values of the parameters and their confidence intervals over various sub-periods to study their stability. Our analysis shows that the residuals of many of the series are much fatter-tailed than in a normal distribution. We observe also that besides the stochastic uncertainty built into the model by the random innovations there is also parameter uncertainty arising from the estimated values of the parameters...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extension}} of previous studies, Hagnell (1991) and Hagnell(1996), where the data used are annual time series for the whole of Sweden during the period 1751 - 1850 for the crude birth rate, the death rate for ages 20 - 50 years, the crude marriage rate and an index of the real wages. The aim of the study of Hagnell (1991) was to investigate the relationships between ferility, adult mortality, nuptiality, and real wages, using VARMA and VAR models. In Hagnell(1996) we use instead of the observed variable real wages, a latent variable called real income. There are three observed stationary variables available which measure the real income. These are a real <b>wages</b> <b>index</b> (used by Hagnell (1991)), a harvest assessment, and the first difference of the logged rye price. Thus real income can be interpreted as a latent variable with three indicators, the real <b>wages</b> <b>index,</b> the harvest assessment, and the first difference of the logged rye price. The idea of real income as a latent variable was used previously in a study of the dependence of adult mortality on real income, Hagnell (1992). We start out from the VARMA(1, 1) model, identified in Hagnell (1991), and then estimate the same model with the observed variable real wages replaced by the latent variable real income. In Hagnell(1996), in order to estmate such a model we construct LISREL models, Jöreskog and Sörbom (1989), following the approach of Molenaar (1985). The first simple LISREL model ignores that our data are time series which are auto- and crosscorrelatated while the more complex models consider autocorrelation of the first order. A more theoretical justification of this approach is given in Variyam(1994) and in Hershberger et al (1996). Here, we use for the same model as above instead a state model approach, Durbin and Koopman (2001). Comparisons are made with the earlier approach with Lisrel models...|$|E

40|$|The study {{raises the}} problem of human capital {{heterogeneity}} at the Russian labor market caused by non-random distribution of unobservable skills across the population of a transition country. At {{the beginning of the}} transition, people who were grown up in different times or cultures have distinct moral norms, behavioral patterns, preferences and the knowledge. This results in the differences in unobservable abilities and earnings capacity of people. We argue that cohort, a pre-transition occupation, an urban place of birth, and nationality might serve as proxies for unobservable skills in the transition. The cohort effects were separated by two ways. According to the first one, the logarithm of the real <b>wages</b> <b>index</b> was used as a proxy for current period. The second one is based on an assumption on the form of age-earnings profiles in Russia. The estimation results reveal the significance of all the proxies for unobservable abilities and the robustness of estimates. At the same time, conditioning of the effects of cohort and pre-transition occupation on gender is discovered.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{investment policy}} {{is an integral}} part of successful activity of the insurance company. The return to the shareholders of the insurance company usually thought of as comprising the underwriting result and investment income. The investment income is very important even for an insurance company, which writes mainly a short tail business. For the successful activity the insurance company needs the appropriate investment policy as well as in good investment control. For this purpose knowledge of the analysis of processes of a behavior of the various interest rates represents large interest. Recently many authors use the stochastic differential equations for description of processes of a development of a various sort of the interest rates. As it is known, solutions of such equations are the Markov processes and the observations of these processes in discrete instants will form time series circumscribed by autoregressive models of the first order. They are popular among those, who are interested in the analysis of financial data. In this connection it is useful to know about that as far as the models with real data will be precisely matched. In the present paper such problems with the special attention to the correspondence of correlation properties of real financial data to correlation properties of processes generated by autoregressive models are considered. The 12 time series of the following financial data were exposed to a research UK Share Price, Dec 1918 - Jun 1995 (919 monthly values). UK Dividend Yield Rate for Shares, Dec 1918 - Jun 1995 (919 monthly values). UK Retail Prices Index, Jun 1900 - May 1995 (1145 monthly values). UK <b>Wages</b> <b>Index,</b> Jun 1920 - Apr 1995 (904 monthly values). Internal Rate of Yield on UK 2. 5 % Consoles, Jun 1900 - Jun 1995 (1146 monthly values).

Currency Exchange Rates, Jan 1991 - Dec 1995 (for 1700 business days) : Swiss Franc versus US $; German Mark versus US $; British Pound versus US $; Japanese Yen versus US $.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between wage indexation, discretionary wage adjustment and inflation in Italy, by specifying and estimating (on quarterly time series for 1963 - 85) a short-term model for the price-wage nexus in the industrial sector of a small open economy. The influence of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> is considered {{in the light of the}} concept of optimum degree of indexation (for which empirical estimates are provided), and the links between <b>indexing</b> and discretionary <b>wage</b> adjustment. The main conclusion is that, at least since 1973, institutional interventions on the degree of indexation seem to be only partially determined by variations in the optimum degree of indexation. As a result, <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> has increased price variance without this being justified by the fact that wages are closer on average to their equilibrium level. On the other hand, the estimates show no impact of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> on the average inflation rate, as price expectations come into wage determination only to the extent of the complement to one of the degree of wage indexation...|$|R

SNF hourly wages paid in non-metropolitan areas averaged 83. 5 % of those in metropolitan areas, compared to 81. 8 % among hospitals.
