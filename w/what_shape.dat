5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further work {{being carried out}} on the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although peace was declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> the fort took; archaeological investigations suggest that it was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; {{there would have been}} battery positions {{on either side of the}} main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had been spent on building and developing the fortification.|$|E
5|$|What came to {{be known}} as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were {{religious}} in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> the church should take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle {{held more}} {{accurate}} theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written {{evidence of a}} camera obscura (after Mozi c. 400 BC) {{can be found in}} Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350BC in Problemata. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or aperture, to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the diaphragm. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.|$|E
500|$|A Reuleaux {{triangle}} [...] is a shape {{formed from}} {{the intersection of}} three circular disks, each having its center on the boundary of the other two. Its boundary is a curve of constant width, the simplest and best known such curve other than the circle itself.

500|$|Franklin {{explained}} in these letters {{that in an}} experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself {{and not in the}} water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged he poured the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged. It turned out the electric force was not condensed in the water itself, as the new Leyden jar had no charge with this water from the first Leyden jar. Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle. It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this [...] "force" [...] of equal and opposite charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E
2500|$|In 1885, Sturgis {{wrote the}} {{libretto}} for Arthur Goring Thomas's opera, Nadeshda, which was first {{performed at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 16 April 1885. In a generally favourable review, the critic in The Times noted that Sturgis had taken the plot from an old Russian story recently adapted as a German novel, and commented, [...] "Wherever or in <b>what</b> <b>shape</b> Mr. Sturgis may have found his materials he has treated them in a clever and workmanlike manner. His diction is not very refined or elevated, and his metre in rhymed lyrics or blank verse often defies the rules of prosody.

More precisely the model explains news variation across different media organization and countries by focusing on the different way the sense of newsworthiness of journalists is affected by three main variables: national interest, national journalistic culture, and editorial policy of each media organization. The model is developed on the basis of an investigation into <b>what</b> <b>shaped</b> the media coverage of 9 / 11 in eight elite newspapers across the US, France, Italy and Pakistan...|$|R
