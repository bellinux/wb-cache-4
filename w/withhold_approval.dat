5000|$|That {{the masked}} {{protocols}} would be rated more negatively was predictable {{for the following}} reasons.

Not surprisingly, most of the negative shifts (84 of 118) were to categories calling for more information. Second, <b>withholding</b> <b>approval</b> had no practical consequence. Third, participants might have felt scrutinized by researchers with an [...] "animal rights" [...] agenda, and erred on the side of deferral or rejection. Fourth, navigating another institution's forms can be difficult. And fifth, IACUCs unfamiliar with particular species or procedures are less likely to understand a protocol. These factors make it almost impossible to compare the actions of the original and unofficial IACUCs and thus call into question the major premises and conclusions of this study.|$|R
