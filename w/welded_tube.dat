40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes.</b> Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - ovalisation relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|R
