40|$|The use of {{horizontally}} curved bridges {{has increased}} considerably {{in recent years}} for highway bridges and interchanges in large urban areas. Due to the increasing demands for reduced dead weight and for efficient cross-section in distributing the wheel loads, <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> construction is introduced. In the past, bridge design engineers have shied away from using <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> construction since they considered it incompatible to the predominately one-way supporting system of a bridge. However, a horizontally-curved bridge can be subjected to large twisting moments. Therefore, the orthogonal rib system in a <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> construction provides an efficient resistance for such twisting moments. In this research, theoretical and experimental {{studies were carried out}} to determine the various rigidities of curved concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges and to investigate their behaviour under working and ultimate loads. In the analyses, the finite difference technique, the finite element method and the yield-line theory were used. Simplified yield-line expressions were developed to predict the collapse load of curved reinforced and prestressed concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges. These expressions were based on both parametric study as well as on laboratory test results on curved <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges. Also, the structural responses of curved prestressed concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> and girder-slab bridges are examined for the effect of prestressing, working load and ultimate load. An analysis for the effect of the high radial forces, generated by the horizontal curvature of the prestressing tendons is proposed. Furthermore, a parametric study was conducted to examine the influence of bridge horizontal radius to width ratio, bridge aspect ratio, loading position and the presence of the transverse ribs on the elastic and post-elastic behaviour of such bridges. The experimental program is divided into two groups: the first group deals with the rigidities of curved <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> structures and consists of nine tests on horizontally curved concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab.</b> The second group deals with the behaviour of curved concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges. It consists of testing three curved concrete slab bridges: the first model was a curved reinforced concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridge; the second model was a curved prestressed concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridge, while the third model was a curved prestressed concrete girder-slab bridge to study the effect of the transverse ribs on the behaviour of curved bridges. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is found. Both the analytical and experimental results demonstrated that both the elastic and post-elastic response of curved <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges are superior to those of girder-slab bridges. Results from the parametric study revealed that the bridge horizontal radius to width ratio, aspect ratio, loading position and the presence of the transverse ribs significantly influence the elastic behaviour as well as the ultimate load capacity of such structures.

40|$|Local {{and perhaps}} {{regional}} vernacular reinforced concrete building construction leans heavily against designing slabs with imbedded hidden beams for flooring systems in most structures including major edifices. The practice is distinctive in both framed and in shear wall structures. Hidden beams are favoured structural elements {{due to their}} many inherent features that characterize them; they save on floor height clearance; they also save on formwork, labour and material cost. Moreover, hidden beams form an acceptable aesthetic appearance that does not hinder efficient interior space partitioning. Such beams have the added advantage of {{clearing the way for}} horizontal electromechanical ductwork. However, seismic considerations, in all likelihood, are seldom seriously addressed. The mentioned structural system of shallow beams is adopted in ribbed <b>slabs,</b> <b>waffle</b> <b>slabs</b> and at times with solid slabs. Ribbed <b>slabs</b> and <b>waffle</b> <b>slabs</b> are more prone to hidden beam inclusion due to the added effective height of the concrete section. Due to the presence of a relatively high reinforcement ratio at the joints the sections at such location tend to become less ductile with unreliable contribution to spandrel force resistance. In the following study the structural influence of hidden beams within slabs is investigated. With the primary focus on a performance based analysis of such elements within a structure. This is investigated with due attention to shear wall contribution to the overall behaviour of such structures. Numerical results point in the direction that the function of hidden beams is not as adequate as desired. Therefore it is strongly believed that they are generally superfluous and maybe eliminated altogether. Conversely, shallow beams seem to render the overall seismic capacity of the structure unreliable. Since such an argument is rarely manifested within the linear analysis domain; a pushover analysis exercise is thus mandatory for behaviour prediction under strong seismic events.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the author}} investigates the behaviour of reinforced and prestressed concrete waffle slabs from initial to collapse load. The theoretical treatment covering {{the whole range}} of load, is divided into three parts: elastic analysis, ultimate analysis, and progressive failure analysis. The elastic analysis part is based on a Fourier series solution for simply supported slabs and this is extended to continuous <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> structures. The ultimate limit state analysis is obtained by adopting the yield line theory as an upper bound solution. The progressive failure analysis is tackled by the finite element method as a numerical technique; beyond the initiation of the first crack at sections of maximum stresses, an iterative incremental procedure is adopted {{to take into account the}} reduction of rigidities with the corresponding increment of loading, thus converting the non-linear problem into a series of incrementally linear problems in the elastic-plastic range. Comparison of results is made between skew and rectangular waffle slabs as well as between continuous slabs on isolated supports and on continuous line-supports. A study of the effect of rotating the isolated column support line about the center of the bridge on the structural response is undertaken. The theoretical analyses are substantiated and verified by experimental results obtained from tests on seven models of reinforced and prestressed concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> bridges. The deflections and strains obtained from the tests are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical solutions. From this study it is concluded that the yield-line analysis is simple and reliable in predicting the ultimate load of <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> structures. Furthermore, prestressed concrete <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> construction is well suited for use in large span structures. Also, in predicting the collapse load of <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> structures, it is found that the progressive failure analysis of such structures gives results which are in close agreement with those obtained from the tests as well as from the yield-line analysis.

40|$|In modern earthquake-resistant design codes, {{structural}} elements have a non-linear behavior during an earthquake, {{similar to what}} is considered in the design process, which implies that elements are damaged and it is interesting for designers {{to be able to}} estimate structure expected global damage and correlate it to design ductility, as well as to ductility demand. Damage indexes calculated when applying the finite element method have values not reflecting deterioration in case of buildings designed for low ductility; this feature being contrary to damage indexes calculated for ductile buildings. Therefore, an objective damage index is proposed, based on ductility and elastic and ultimate stiffness values, independent to selected structural typology. The procedure is illustrated by means of an index assessment from damage caused to three buildings, two designed for low ductility (buildings with <b>waffle</b> <b>slabs</b> and framed buildings with wide beams) and a framed building, designed for high ductility.

Two-way slabs are a form of construction unique to reinforced concrete comparing with the other major structural materials. It is an efficient, economical, and widely used structural system. The present dissertation aims to analyze and compare costs between four types of slabs: <b>waffle</b> <b>slab</b> with recuperate molds, flat slabs with drop panels, two-way slabs with beams and flat plates. In this analysis the loads considered for the floors were of a residential type. The most common spans for slabs were considered. For {{the analysis of the}} slabs the simplified methods were used. For the design, security checks and construction rules, it was considered the current legislation applied in the member countries of the European Committee for Standardization, namely the Eurocodes.

The use of hysteretic energy dissipators for seismic protection of wide-beam buildings is proposed. This study focusses in 3 and 6 -story representative buildings; each building is designed for no, moderate and mid seismicity (design PGA 0. 0 g, 0. 12 g and 0. 23 g, respectively). The mechanical parameters of the dissipators are selected from two approaches: an algorithm aiming to obtain uniform cumulated plastic ductility along {{the height of the}} building and a simpler approach where the yielding forces of each dissipative device are chosen proportional to those induced by the equivalent static forces in the Spanish design code. The suitability of the proposed solutions is assessed through dynamic analyses for representative seismic records; the performance criteria are the reduction of the interstory drift, of the base shear, of the absolute accelerations, and of the cumulated plastic displacements in the structure and in the dissipators. Three cases are compared: bare frame (building without any bracing), protected frame (building with dissipators) and braced frame (building with rigid connections instead of dissipators).

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the structural seismic response has gained a special importance both for the seismic design of buildings as for predicting {{the damage caused by}} earthquakes. In this thesis a complete study about the seismic risk assessment of the two main structural typologies of residential buildings of Barcelona, Spain, is presented. These correspond to reinforced concrete buildings with <b>waffle</b> <b>slabs</b> and unreinforced masonry buildings. The main goal of this research is to apply a systematic methodology for the seismic risk assessment, by means of fragility curves, in buildings located in urban zones with moderate seismic hazard. After revising the conceptual aspects involved in the seismic risk assessment and describing {{the current state of the}} art, the adopted methodology to evaluate the structural capacity, fragility and expected damage analyses is described. To assess the capacity a structural modelling of the buildings and a non-linear static analysis is required. The fragility or vulnerability is evaluated through the capacity spectrum, by means of a simplified procedure. The damage probability matrixes for a given seismic scenario require knowledge of the maximum structural response, which is obtained by using the capacity spectrum method. The methodology has been applied to three reinforced concrete models representative of low, mid and high rise buildings of the city; this has allowed developing seismic risk scenarios for two earthquakes, which occurrence in Barcelona is reasonably possible. These scenarios take into account the Barcelona seismic zoning. The method has been also applied to characterize the expected seismic behaviour of masonry buildings, modelling three typical buildings of the Eixample District. Two of them present different plane configuration, one more regular than the other. The third is representative of corner buildings, typical of the city's blocks. The better behaviour of the regular buildings compared to corner buildings is confirmed. An aggregate set of buildings, corresponding to a typical line of the district's blocks has been studied. It has been observed that the aggregate behaviour does not improve; instead it inherits the vulnerability of the constituting buildings. A sensitivity {{analysis of}} the slight and extensive threshold damage states is carried out; it is observed that little variations in these thresholds significantly influence the expected damage. Consequently, new thresholds for these damage states are proposed based on certain structural characteristics obtained from the non-linear static analysis. The proposed slight damage threshold takes into account the elastic stiffness degradation, while hardening is considered for the extensive damage state. To validate the results obtained with of the employed methodology, a series of non linear dynamic analysis were carried out in two reinforced concrete buildings. The global results were compatible with the ones of the methodology. In general, the results show a good confidence level. Finally, the conclusions drawn the current thesis are summarized and some recommendations for future works are given. Postprint (published version...|$|R
