500|$|Swan's {{time on the}} South Coast was miserable: {{family dog}} Zee died; wife Bex had a {{difficult}} birth with baby George; and Swan became a hate figure with his teammates and the local population at large after the club suffered a poor start to the season. Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted – the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got {{off on the wrong}} foot with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain at the expense of fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton £150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan [...] "If you're so desperate to leave, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to Plymouth in the first place?"; his answer of [...] "For the money" [...] only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve {{towards the end of the}} season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994–95 – to Swan's delight.|$|E
