25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{interactivity}} and its meaning, {{we assume}} {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

Building on the case of the photographic exhibit, we show that recognizing the diversity of property changes our rapport with organization studies as a field, by unifying its approaches to the individual-vs. -collective dilemma.
