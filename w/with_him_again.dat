5|$|Donaggio won a 'best {{soundtrack of}} the year' {{award for his}} work on the film, which gave him the {{confidence}} to quit his successful singing career and embark on a career scoring films. Donaggio became a regular composer for Brian De Palma films and credits Nicolas Roeg with giving him his first lesson in writing film scores, and expressed a desire to work <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, Thin Lizzy had stabilised around {{founding}} members, {{lead singer}} and bassist Phil Lynott and drummer Brian Downey, alongside guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson. The band had found commercial success with several hit singles {{and developed a}} strong live following, including headlining the Reading Festival. Robertson had briefly left the band in 1977 but subsequently returned. The group had planned {{to make a new}} studio album at the start of 1978. Working with producer Tony Visconti, Thin Lizzy retained commercial success with the album Bad Reputation, and the group wanted to work <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> However, Visconti had a very tight schedule and had committed to producing several albums for other artists, so Lynott suggested instead that they spend two weeks together compiling a live album from earlier recordings.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Again,</b> Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E

5|$|While Agni is the saviour in the Kurma Purana, the Rama-centric Adhyatma Ramayana replaces Agni {{with the}} omniscient Rama as the mastermind. Rama knows of Ravana's {{intentions}} and orders Sita to place her chaya (shadow) outside the hut for Ravana to abduct and {{go inside the}} hut and live hidden in the fire for a year; after Ravana's death, she would unite <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Sita complies and creates her illusionary form, Maya Sita, and enters the fire. After Maya Sita's seizure, Rama grieves for Sita. It is unclear if Rama pretends to grieve or forgets that Maya Sita is the one actually kidnapped. After Ravana's death, Maya Sita has to face the Agni Pariksha and vanishes in the fire. Agni reinstates Sita and declares that Rama created the illusionary Sita to bring about Ravana's annihilation and with that purpose served, the true Sita returns to Rama. Inspired by Adhyatma Ramayana, the Ramacharitmanas has a very similar narrative; however, Agni Pariskha narrative is longer and Maya Sita is explicitly stated to be destroyed in the fire. The Nepali Bhanubhakta Ramayana by Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814 – 1868) portrays Rama creating the illusionary Sita from the sacred Kusha grass and entrusting Sita to Agni; at Agni Pariksha, the grass Maya Sita turns into ashes while the true Sita reappears before the world. A popular Indian television series Ramayan (1987–88) by Ramanand Sagar reveals that Maya Sita had replaced Sita only in the Agni Pariksha scene and uses flashback to narrate about the exchange.|$|E

He {{was a major}} baseball fan, and had personal friendships with numerous well-known players of the time. Phelps received much of the attention {{of his mother and}} grandmother during his childhood; this led to a strained relationship with his sister, who remained embittered towards him {{for the rest of her}} life. She left America in the 1920s, and never spoke <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> He preferred to live in hotels and move from place to place, and never owned any real estate.|$|E

25|$|Price withdrew south, and Pleasonton pursued {{him into}} Kansas.

After an {{artillery}} bombardment that began at 4:00 a.m., Pleasonton's men launched a furious assault. Price ordered his troops to cross the swollen river, leaving Fagan to hold off the Federals until he could get his wagon train across. Although the Union captured two cannon and several prisoners, they were unable to prevent the escape of Price's force. Pleasonton continued his pursuit of Price, catching up <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> later that morning at Mine Creek.|$|E

Ah Jie unhappy with Kai Qi running out on him that day, has the entire restaurant staff help him teach her a lesson by pretending to ignore his love for her.

When Lear arrives, he objects to the mistreatment of his messenger, but Regan is as dismissive of her father as Goneril was. Lear is enraged but impotent. Goneril arrives and {{supports}} Regan's argument against him. Lear yields completely to his rage. He rushes out into a storm to rant against his ungrateful daughters, accompanied by the mocking Fool. Kent later follows to protect him. Gloucester protests against Lear's mistreatment. With Lear's retinue of a hundred knights dissolved, the only companions he has left are his Fool and Kent. Wandering on the heath after the storm, Edgar, {{in the guise of}} a madman named Tom o' Bedlam, meets Lear. Edgar babbles madly while Lear denounces his daughters.

25|$|Roosevelt had various extra-marital affairs, {{including}} one with Eleanor's social secretary Lucy Mercer, which began soon {{after she was}} hired in early 1914. In September 1918, Eleanor found letters revealing the affair in Roosevelt's luggage. Franklin contemplated divorcing Eleanor, but Sara objected strongly and Lucy would not agree to marry a divorced man with five children. Franklin and Eleanor remained married, and Roosevelt promised never to see Lucy again. Eleanor never truly forgave him, and their marriage {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Eleanor soon thereafter established a separate house in Hyde Park at Val-Kill, and increasingly devoted herself to various social and political causes independently of her husband. The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Roosevelt asked Eleanor in 1942—in light of his failing health—to come back home and live <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> she refused.|$|E
25|$|The Dolphins had to punt {{early in}} the second quarter {{at the end of their}} next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard {{completion}} to Reed brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20-3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20-10. Not to be outdone, Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, he kept it going with a 13-yard pass to Reed on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27-10 with five minutes left in the half.|$|E
25|$|Despite this estrangement, {{the couple}} again met foxhunting and resumed a {{discreet}} relationship. Marshall Field {{was at first}} unimpressed by the impecunious Beatty as a future son-in-law, but was persuaded by his heroic reputation, impressive record of promotion and future prospects. There was the possibility that Field might revoke the settlement he had made on his daughter {{at the time of}} her first marriage and the new couple would have no means of support. Beatty's father was also unhappy about the match, fearing a repeat of the difficulties he had faced with his own relationship with a married woman, but with the added risk of publicity because both Beatty and Ethel were famous and the risk that Beatty's illegitimacy might be exposed. Beatty went so far as to consult a fortune teller, Mrs. Roberts, who predicted a fine outcome to the match. Ethel wrote to Arthur, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> as his wife, though not naming any particular person or reason. Arthur agreed to co-operate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Beatty and Ethel married on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square, London with no family attending. Although Arthur Tree was himself from a wealthy American family, he now had to adjust to reduced circumstances without Ethel's support. He elected to remain in Britain and their son Ronald remained with him. Ronald and his mother were never reconciled from his perception that she had deserted his father, but he visited in later life and became friendly with Beatty. Ronald later became a member of parliament and, during the Second World War became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house, Ditchley Park near Oxford, to Winston Churchill for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe. Beatty and Ethel set up home at Hanover Lodge in Regent's Park, London.|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to avoid {{answering}} questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if {{she was still in}} contact with him and if she would ever work <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Farley said Aaliyah responded with a [...] "firm, frosty" [...] 'No' to both of the questions. Vibe magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime [...] "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 that when [...] "R.

Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Tora! Tora! Tora!, finally {{released}} to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an [...] "almost unmitigated tragedy" [...] in Kurosawa's career. He had spent {{years of his}} life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, The Bad Sleep Well). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "Duets", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet {{competition}} while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was just using him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in [...] "Never Been Kissed", he gets her to go out <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> As of [...] "Furt", they are officially dating. In [...] "Sexy", following her performance of [...] "Landslide" [...] with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and {{would never do anything}} to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that if she and Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so.|$|E
