40|$|For the {{production}} of silicon photo-transducers (PhT) the acquisition of epitaxial compositions (EC) with high resistivity of <b>working</b> <b>layer.</b> One of the main parameters characterizing the quality of EC is the density of dislocation and other structural defects. Great impact {{on the development of}} defects during epitaxial growth is produced by the quality of underlay preparation before that. Multiple research of relatively thin (less than 20 - 30 microns) epitaxial layers demonstrated, that contamination or damages of underlay surface cause the development of defects of wrapping, counterparts, macroscopic protuberances in the growing layer. During inverted epitaxy there are no high requirements as for structural perfection of epitaxial layer as far as in PhT, produced on the basis of EC for which inverted silicon structures (ISS) serve with the <b>working</b> <b>layer</b> of mono-crystal substrate. Therefore in inverted epitaxy it is the problem of the development in the course of defects growth not in epitaxial layer, but in underlay, that becomes the major one.

For those sufficiently heat-annealed films, another system presenting significant emissive exciton-carrier collision (ECC) is discovered. In addition, the appearing of ECC indicates the emerging of an internal morphology after heat annealing, which is assigned to a recently discussed twinning subgrain structure.

40|$|We {{study the}} time {{evolution}} of a neural network model as it learns the three stages of a visual delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) task: identification of the sample, retention during delay, and matching of sample and target, ignoring distractors. We introduce a neurobiologically plausible, uncommited architecture, comprising an ‘executive’ subnetwork gating connections to and from a ‘working ’ layer. The network learns DMS by reinforcement: reward-dependent synaptic plasticity generates task-dependent behaviour. During learning, <b>working</b> <b>layer</b> cells exhibit stimulus specialization and increased tuning of their firing. The emergence of top-down activity is observed, reproducing aspects of prefrontal cortex control on activity in the visual areas of inferior temporal cortex. We observe a lability of neural systems during learning, with a tendency to encode spurious associations. Executive areas are instrumental during learning to prevent such associations; they are also fundamental for the ‘mature’ network to keep passing DMS. In the mature model, the <b>working</b> <b>layer</b> functions as a short-term memory. The mature system is remarkably robust against cell damage and its performance degrades gracefully as damage increases. The model underlines that executive systems, which regulate {{the flow of information}} between working memory and sensory areas, are required for passing tests such as DMS.
