25|$|Phosphoric acid is {{produced}} industrially by two general routes – the thermal {{process and the}} <b>wet</b> <b>process,</b> which includes two sub-methods. The <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> dominates in the commercial sector. The more expensive thermal process produces a purer product, which is used for applications in the food industry.|$|E

25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|E
40|$|The <b>wetting</b> <b>process</b> of {{a liquid}} {{aluminium}} drop on a solid Al 2 O 3 surface has been investigated. Two different {{models have been}} proposed: a hydrodynamic model based {{on the effect of}} viscosity as well as a diffusion model which considers diffusional effects. The prediction from the models was compared with experiments. It was found that the <b>wetting</b> <b>process</b> of a liquid aluminium drop on an Al 2 O 3 surface can be represented by the diffusion model rather than by the hydrodynamic model. In contrast, the hydrodynamic model could be employed to describe the <b>wetting</b> <b>process</b> of a liquid polymer drop on a solid. ...|$|R

25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E

40|$|Particle surface {{modification}} of powdered materials has currently attracted considerable attention in various industrial and scientific fields. However, conventional <b>wet</b> <b>processes,</b> such as plating and impregnation method, produce wastewater streams containing potentially harmful residual chemicals. In addition, the <b>wet</b> <b>processes</b> involve the decomposition of precursors by heating and chemical reduction, which interfere with controlled {{surface modification}}. To avoid such drawbacks of <b>wet</b> <b>processes,</b> {{we have developed}} novel particle surface modification methods based on the plasma technologies. In our original surface modification methods, a polygonal barrel containing the powdered sample is rotated or oscillated to stir the particles during treatment, achieving the uniform modification of the particle surfaces. Since plasma technologies used in our methods are categorized as dry processes, they do not accompany wastewater discharge. Furthermore, the treatment in our methods is carried out without heating or chemical reduction, allowing controlled surface modification. This report describes the particle surface modification using the “polygonal barrel-sputtering method”, “polygonal barrel-plasma chemical vapor deposition method”, and “polygonal barrel-plasma treatment method”...|$|R
40|$|The Soil-Water Characteristics Curve (SWCC) is {{affected}} by the initial density of soil under unsaturated condition. Also, the characteristic of hydraulic conductivity is changed by the initial density of soil. To study the effect of initial density of unsaturated soil, SWCC and the Hydraulic Conductivity Function (HCF) of Jumoonjin sand with various relative densities, 40 %, 60 % and 75 % were measured in both drying and <b>wetting</b> <b>processes.</b> As the results of SWCC estimated by van Genuchten (1980) model, the parameter related to Air Entry Value(AEV), α in the <b>wetting</b> <b>process</b> is larger than that in drying process, but the parameters related to the SWCC slope, n and the residual water content, m are larger than those in <b>wetting</b> <b>process.</b> The AEV is increased or Water Entry Value (WEV) is decreased with increasing the relative density of sand. The AEV is larger than the WEV at the same relative density of sand. As the results of HCF estimated by van Genuchten (1980) model {{which is one of the}} parameter estimation methods, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity maintained at a saturated one in the low level of matric suctions and then suddenly decreased just before the AEV or the WEV.

It will be observed that four at least of the six composites are closely alike. I should say that in each of this set (which was made by the <b>wet</b> <b>process)</b> the last of the three components was always allowed a longer exposure than the second, and the second than the first, but it is found better to allow an equal time to all of them.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} footnote on the <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> {{history is}} that some manufacturers have in fact made very old <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> facilities profitable {{through the use of}} waste fuels. Plants that burn waste fuels enjoy a negative fuel cost (they are paid by industries needing to dispose of materials that have energy content and can be safely disposed of in the cement kiln thanks to its high temperatures and longer retention times). As a result, the inefficiency of the <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> is an advantage—to the manufacturer. By locating waste burning operations at older <b>wet</b> <b>process</b> locations, higher fuel consumption actually equates to higher profits for the manufacturer, although it produces correspondingly greater emission of CO2. Manufacturers who think such emissions should be reduced are abandoning the use of <b>wet</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Wet</b> {{grinding}} <b>process</b> is {{an interesting}} means of producing fine and nano particles. The particle sizing {{plays an important role}} in interpretation, control and optimization of various aspects of the <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process.</b> There is a lack of knowledge in understanding different aspects of particle sizing during a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process.</b> The particle sizing in a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process</b> is typical in the sense: (i) The dispersions in a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process,</b> often, involve additives and (or) impurities. It is less known how impurities and additives influence the particle size of the dispersions in the <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process.</b> (ii) In a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process,</b> dispersions of different concentrations may be used. It is less known how dispersions of different concentration may influence the particle sizing in a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process.</b> (iii) In a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process,</b> the change in average particle size of the product is rapid due to relatively fast breakage of the particles. (iv) The degree of poly dispersity in product changes with grinding time. (v) The nature of interaction between particles is non-colloidal before grinding process; this interaction becomes colloidal after a certain grinding time. Similarly, there is a lack of knowledge to understand how quality of final ground product is influenced in a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process.</b> This study investigates the different aspects of particle sizing and product quality of aqueous dispersions of CaCO 3 in a <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process</b> carried out in a stirred media mill. Acoustic attenuation spectroscopy that is known for measuring particle size of dispersions on line, under real process conditions and without diluting the sample has been employed in the study in addition to the technique of dynamic light scattering. The study brings out the conditions in which the effects of impurities and additives etc. on particle size of the dispersions may be determined using acoustic attenuation spectroscopy. Furthermore, the study compares and analyze the particle sizing results obtained though acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The causes of differences in the results of two techniques have been investigated. We report presence of multiple scattering at high concentration of the dispersions during <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process</b> that result in misleading results of the particles sizes. Quality is an intangible concept. In order to understand how different operating parameters influence product quality, we propose a method based upon the definition of quality as defined in ISO 9000 : 2005. The method takes into consideration the important operating parameters of <b>wet</b> grinding <b>process</b> (such as the operating condition of the mill, the measurement of particle size and the material) and important product characteristics (such as average particle size, range of width of particle size distribution, stability of dispersion, degree of impurities, specific energy input and physical appearance).
