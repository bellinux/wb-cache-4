40|$|Drill hole UE 25 a- 1 has {{penetrated}} tuffs of Tertiary age {{which contain}} two major zeolitized horizons at depths below 380 m. These horizons {{are restricted to}} low-density, high-porosity nonwelded tuffs below the basal vitrophyre of the Topopah Springs Member of the Paintbrush Tuff (approximately 70 m above the current water table), and interfinger with more-densely-welded devitrified tuffs of granophyric mineralogy. Zeolites occur as glass pyroclast replacement, vug linings, and fracture fillings. Nonwelded units above the <b>welded</b> <b>portion</b> of the Topopah Springs Member are essentially unaltered, indicating that {{they have never been}} ground water-saturated for any significant length of time. Zeolite mineral assemblages appear to be characteristic of low temperature (10 wt % Na{sub 2 }O + K{sub 2 }O), occur as vug fillings at depths below 500 m. Presence of mordenite may indicate slightly elevated alteration temperatures, but more likely reflects enrichment of ground water in alkalis with depth.

40|$|Locomotives are {{the back}} bone of the {{transportation}} system in any country. Locomotive mainly consists of engine and control assembly placed on the under-frame which in turn rests on two bogies. Cracks are reported {{to occur in the}} bolster beam of the bogie frames in one of the designs of locomotives in service. Cracks are treated by welding and locomotive is resent in operation but cracks appeared again on some other locations beside the <b>welded</b> <b>portion.</b> In order to investigate the reasons for crack initiation; data regarding rail track and its quality, routes and severity of operation and drawings of the locomotive is collected. Finite element analysis is then performed first for the existing design of the locomotive in use to find the reason for the crack. Curvature and small radii are concluded the main reason of crack initiation and propagation under continuous oscillatory lateral movement on straight track and lateral forces during turning. In addition, removal of stiffeners from certain locations concluded ease of manufacturing. Use of friction modifiers is recommended to reduce forces generating cracks.

40|$|A {{study of}} more than 22, 000 feet of core from five deep drill holes at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{provided}} data on the attitude and vertical distribution of faults and fractures, the sense of fault displacement, and the occurrence of calcite. The study was done mainly to look for evidence of fault flattening at depth, but no consistent downward decrease in dip of faults was found, and no increase in strata rotation was evident with increasing depth. In the two drill holes located near prominent faults that dip toward the holes (USW G- 3 and G- 2), an apparent increase in the frequency of faults occurs below the tuffs and lavas of Calico Hills. Some of this increase occurs in brittle lavas and flow breccias in {{the lower part of the}} volcanic section. In the two holes presumed to be relatively removed from the influence of important faults at depth, the vertical distribution of faults is relatively uniform. Calcite occurs mainly in two general zones, voids in <b>welded</b> <b>portions</b> of the Paintbrush Tuff, and in a deeper zone, mostly below 3, 500 feet. Calcite is least abundant in USW G- 4, which may reflect the fewer faults and fractures encountered in that drill hole...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{takes the}} Q 345 steel as an example, {{adopting}} finite element simulative analysis {{to study the}} influence of solid-state transformation on welding residual stress. By setting {{the value of the}} thermal strain in different temperature, the change in volume caused by the phase changes is equivalent to the thermal strain. Simulation includes two cases which are consideration of phase transformations and not consideration. The results showed that the distribution trend of the longitudinal stress of the weld zone is substantially the same in the two simulations. In the case of not consider the simulation of phase change, {{there is a lot of}} stress in the weld zone and the heat affected zone and the maximum value could be 427 MPa. In regard to transverse stress, phase change not only affects the value of the stress, but also changes the direction of the stress of the <b>weld</b> middle <b>portion.</b> <b>Welding</b> residual stress is also measured by X-ray. Phase change simulation and experimental results are in good agreement, it can be concluded that phase change in the welding process will result in a significant impact on the distribution of the residual stress, which could not be ignored in the finite element simulation of welding process...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{microstructural}} {{studies were}} conducted on the basal, nonwelded and partially <b>welded</b> <b>portions</b> of the rhyolite Bishop Tuff in eastern California to examine the nature and processes of brittle deformation in these units. The nonwelded tuff consists of a variable sequence of finely laminated to massive pumice-rich deposits, fine-grained ash, and pyroclastic glass erupted from the Long Valley Caldera. The deposits are experiencing east–west extension in the hanging wall of the White Mountain fault, and small-displacement faults and fractures cut the tuff. Deformation in the Bishop Tuff occurred by fracturing associated with faults, and by slip along narrow faults with smooth, often mineralized surfaces. Localization of fracturing {{appears to be a}} function of welding. Units with a greater degree of welding have a greater abundance of fractures associated with faults, whereas nonwelded portions typically have a narrow deformation band–type faults with little or no associated damage. Microstructural observations show that transgranular fractures lie along grain boundaries of pumice and feldspar phenocrysts, and these fractures are often filled with calcite. These deposits appear to have behaved as an open-cell foam with a low strength, but with a cohesion that allowed the support of a differential stress to failure that resulted in subvertical open fractures and faults. These results demonstrate how brittle deformation may be manifested in nonwelded deposits in the vadose zone, and impart an anisotropy in which flow would be enhanced vertically and impeded horizontally. The Bishop Tuff is analogous to other nonwelded tuffs in the western USA. Thus, these results have implications for understanding deformation and flow in a variety of arid regions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Investigation {{results are}} {{presented}} {{of the effect of}} main parameters of laser powder surfacing of the Si-Mo spheroidal cast iron with the nickel based powder on quality and shape of padding <b>welds</b> and <b>portion</b> of the substrate material in the padding weld. Design/methodology/approach: It was shown basing on investigation of the process of laser powder surfacing with the nickel based powder onto the spheroidal cast iron substrate that it is feasible to make high quality padding welds in the relatively wide range of parameters. Findings: Investigation results presented in the paper were carried out to determine quality of padding welds applied by laser powder surfacing with the nickel based powder onto the alloy spheroidal cast iron and especially to determine the padding welds adhesion to the substrate. Practical implications: It is possible to control the portion of the substrate material in the padding weld with high accuracy in a wide range from even a few per cent, by the relevant setting of the line energy of the laser beam and the powder feed rate. Originality/value: The developed implant test makes the qualitative and quantitative assessment possible of the adhesion of the padding weld to the substrate, Table 5, Figs. 7 to 11. All padding welds made within the range of the optimum welding parameters demonstrated very good adhesion and the break, depending on the nickel padding weld thickness, occurred in the fusion area or by pulling part of the padding weld out...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} in which identification of the controlling crack path was critical to identifying the root cause of the failure. The case involves the rupture of a 30 -inch (0. 76 m) natural gas pipeline in 2010 that tragically led to the destruction of a number of homes and the loss of life. The segment of the pipeline that ruptured was installed in 1956. The longitudinal seam of the segment that ruptured {{was supposed to have been}} fabricated by double submerged arc <b>welding.</b> Unfortunately, <b>portions</b> of the segment only received a single submerged arc weld on the outside, leaving unwelded areas on the inside diameter. Post-failure examination of the segment revealed that the rupture originated at one of these unwelded areas. Examination also revealed three additional crack paths or zones emanating from the unwelded area: a zone of ductile tearing, a zone of fatigue, and a zone of cleavage fracture, in that sequence. Initial investigators ignored the ductile tear, assumed the critical crack path was the fatigue component, and (incorrectly) concluded that the root cause of the incident was the failure of the operator to hydrotest the segment after it was installed in 1956. However, as discussed in this paper, the critical path or mechanism was the ductile tear. Furthermore, it was determined that the ductile tear was created during the hydrotest at installation by a mechanism known as pressure reversal. Thus the correct root cause of the rupture was the hydrotest the operator subjected the segment to at installation, helping to increase the awareness of operators and regulators about the potential problems associated with hydrotesting...|$|R
40|$|The end {{corrosion}} {{in steel}} girders {{at the bearings}} due to joint leakage is a significant problem {{in many of the}} old bridges around the nation. This critical damage impairs the shear and bearing capacities of girders. Research has been conducted investigating a novel method for retrofitting the corroded ends of steel bridge girders using ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) encasings. The repair involves casting thin UHPC panels on each side of girder web. Shear studs <b>welded</b> to undamaged <b>portion</b> of the web and flange engage the UHPC panels and provide an alternate load path. This repair method is expected to be superior to the current practice of attaching steel cover plates. It can be easier to design and install, reduce obstruction to traffic during the repair, prevent future corrosion to the girder end, and reduce the total cost of repair. To investigate the effectiveness of the repair in recovering the capacity of the corrosion damaged girders, three large-scale experiments were performed on the undamaged, damaged and repaired rolled girders. It was found that a 1 3 / 4 -in. thick UHPC panel cast two-third of the height of the girder effectively restores the bearing capacity. A high fidelity finite element model was created from the results of the large-scale experiments. This model was then used to design eight repair techniques for full size plate and rolled girders with heavy corrosion damage. This innovative repair method may offer the bridge design community a superior alternative retrofit method for large scale application on the nation’s aging bridge infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|As {{directed}} by ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]), {{an analysis of}} the degradation of the engineered barrier system (EBS) drip shields and waste packages at the Yucca Mountain repository is developed. The purpose of this activity is to provide the TSPA with inputs and methodologies used to evaluate waste package and drip shield degradation as a function of exposure time under exposure conditions anticipated in the repository. This analysis provides information useful to satisfy ''Yucca Mountain Review Plan, Final Report'' (NRC 2003 [DIRS 163274]) requirements. Several features, events, and processes (FEPs) are also discussed (Section 6. 2, Table 15). The previous revision of this report was prepared as a model report in accordance with AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models. Due to changes in the role of this report since the site recommendation, it no longer contains model development. This revision is prepared as a scientific analysis in accordance with AP-SIII. 9 Q, ''Scientific Analyses'' and uses models previously validated in (1) ''Stress Corrosion Cracking of the Drip Shield, the Waste Package Outer Barrier, and the Stainless Steel Structural Material'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169985]); (2) ''General Corrosion and Localized Corrosion of Waste Package Outer Barrier'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169984]); and (3) ''General Corrosion and Localized Corrosion of Drip Shield'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169845]). The integrated waste package degradation (IWPD) analysis presented in this report treats several implementation-related issues, such as defining the number and size of patches per waste package that undergo stress corrosion cracking; recasting the weld flaw analysis in a form as implemented in the Closure Weld Defects (CWD) software; and, general corrosion rate manipulations (e. g., change of scale in Section 6. 3. 4). The <b>weld</b> flaw <b>portion</b> of this report takes input from an engineering calculation (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170024]) and uses standard mathematical methods to enable easier implementation. The IWPD analysis also provides guidance on implementation of early failures (importance sampling and multinomial distribution usage). These manipulations are evident from standard scientific practices, approaches, or methods and do not require changes to the previously validated models. The IWPD analysis itself (Section 6. 4), not the resultant curves from executing the IWPD analysis presented in Section 6. 5 (which are for illustrative purposes), is used directly in total system performance assessment (TSPA). The IWPD analysis simulates general corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of the waste package outer barrier and general corrosion of the drip shield. The effects of igneous and seismic events and localized corrosion on drip shield and waste package performance are not evaluated in this report. The outputs of this report are inputs and methodologies used by TSPA to evaluate waste package and drip shield degradation as a function of exposure time under exposure conditions anticipated in the repository. The analyses presented in this report are for the current repository design (BSC 2004 [DIRS 168489]) ...|$|R
