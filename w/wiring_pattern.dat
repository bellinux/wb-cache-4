Multiple-neurite intersections were formed by a directed growth of neurites toward neurite intersections, they facilitated target switching by axons, and their frequency was elevated by activity through NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. Thus, clustering and strengthening of synaptic connections by activity-reinforced multiple-neurite convergence may serve to imprint information onto <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> and synaptic maps...|$|R

Therefore, understanding how developmental signals interact to regulate axonal extension and retraction to achieve precise neuronal connectivity {{is a fundamental}} goal of neurobiology. We investigated this question in the developing adult brain of Drosophila and find that it is regulated by crosstalk between Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, but independent of neuronal activity. The Rac 1 GTPase integrates a Wnt-Frizzled-Disheveled axon-stabilizing signal and a Branchless (FGF) -Breathless (FGF receptor) axon-retracting signal to modulate JNK activity.

40|$|Across {{the nervous}} system, neurons form highly stereotypic {{patterns}} of synaptic connections {{that are designed}} to serve specific functions. Mature <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> are often attained upon the refinement of early, less precise connectivity. Much work has led to the prevailing view that many developing circuits are sculpted by activity-dependent competition among converging afferents, which results in the elimination of unwanted synapses and the maintenance and strengthening of desired connections. Studies of the vertebrate retina, however, have recently revealed that activity can play a role in shaping developing circuits without engaging competition among converging inputs that differ in their activity levels. Such neurotransmission-mediated processes can produce stereotypic <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> by promoting selective synapse formation rather than elimination.

A fabrication process was developed to define the <b>wire</b> <b>patterns</b> on a transparent glass substrate to create the desired magnetic field for atom trapping experiments. An area on the chip was reserved for the optical access, so that the laser light can penetrate directly through the glass substrate for the laser cooling process. Furthermore, since the thermal conductivity of the glass substrate is poorer than other common materials for atom chip substrate, for example silicon, silicon carbide, aluminum nitride.

40|$|The {{notion that}} healthy brain {{function}} emerges from coordinated neural activity {{constrained by the}} brain's network of anatomical connections-i. e., the connectome-suggests that alterations in the connectome's <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> may underlie brain disorders. Corroborating this hypothesis, studies in schizophrenia are indicative of altered connectome architecture including reduced communication efficiency, disruptions of central brain hubs, and affected "rich club" organization. Whether similar deficits are present in bipolar disorder is currently unknown. This study examines structural connectome topology in 216 bipolar I disorder patients as compared to 144 healthy controls, focusing in particular on central regions (i. e., brain hubs) and connections (i. e., rich club connections, interhemispheric connections) of the brain's network. We find that bipolar I disorder patients exhibit reduced global efficiency (- 4. 4 %, P = 0. 002) and that this deficit relates (r = 0. 56, P 0. 1).

40|$|Heterogeneous {{and dynamic}} single cell {{migration}} behaviours arise from a complex multi-scale signalling network comprising both molecular components and macromolecular modules, among which cell-matrix adhesions and F-actin directly mediate migration. To date, the global wiring architecture characterizing this network remains poorly defined. It is also unclear whether such a <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> may be stable and generalizable to different conditions, or plastic and context dependent. Here, synchronous imaging-based quantification of migration system organization, represented by 87 morphological and dynamic macromolecular module features, and migration system behaviour, i. e., migration speed, facilitated Granger causality analysis. We thereby leveraged natural cellular heterogeneity to begin mapping the directionally specific causal wiring between organizational and behavioural {{features of the}} cell migration system. This represents an important advance on commonly used correlative analyses that do not resolve causal directionality. We identified organizational features such as adhesion stability and adhesion F-actin content that, as anticipated, causally influenced cell migration speed. Strikingly, {{we also found that}} cell speed can exert causal influence over organizational features, including cell shape and adhesion complex location, thus revealing causality in directions contradictory to previous expectations.

40|$|Genetic {{circuits}} {{that regulate}} distinct cellular processes can {{differ in their}} <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> of interactions (architecture) and susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations (noise). Whether the link between circuit architecture and noise is of biological importance remains, however, poorly understood. To investigate this problem, we performed a computational study of gene expression noise for all possible circuit architectures of feed-forward loop (FFL) motifs. Results revealed that FFL architectures fall into two categories depending on whether their ON (stimulated) or OFF (unstimulated) steady states exhibit noise. To explore the biological importance of this difference in noise behavior, we analyzed 858 documented FFLs in Escherichia coli that were divided into 39 functional categories. The majority of FFLs were found to regulate two subsets of functional categories. Interestingly, these two functional categories associated with FFLs of opposite noise behaviors. This opposite noise preference revealed two noise-based strategies to cope with environmental constraints where cellular responses are either initiated or terminated stochastically to allow probabilistic sampling of alternative states. FFLs may thus be selected for their architecture-dependent noise behavior, revealing a biological role for noise that is encoded in gene circuit architectures...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} networks can {{be successfully}} modeled as Boolean networks. A much discussed hypothesis says that such model networks reproduce empirical findings the best {{if they are}} tuned to operate at criticality, i. e. at the borderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have been argued {{to lead to a}} number of functional advantages such as maximal dynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an excellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the effect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex tasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones learning in the fastest possible way [...] even for asynchronous updating rules [...] and that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to criticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in the network states and/or in its <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> are introduced, the optimally performing networks become clearly subcritical.

40|$|Negative {{guidance}} molecules {{are important}} for guiding the growth of axons and ultimately for determining the <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> in the developing nervous system. In tissue culture, growth cones at the tips of growing axons collapse in response to negative guidance molecules, such as ephrin-A 2 and semaphorin 3 A. The small GTPase Rac 1 is involved in growth cone collapse, but {{the nature of its}} role is not clear. Rac 1 activity assays showed that Rac 1 is transiently inactivated after treatment with ephrin-A 2. Ephrin-induced growth cone collapse, however, correlated with resumption of Rac 1 activity. We demonstrate that Rac 1 is required for endocytosis of the growth cone plasma membrane and reorganization of F-actin but not for the depolymerization of F-actin during growth cone collapse in response to ephrin-A 2 and semaphorin 3 A. Rac 1, however, does not regulate constitutive endocytosis in growth cones. These findings show that in response to negative guidance molecules, the function of Rac 1 changes from promoting actin polymerization associated with axon growth to driving endocytosis of the plasma membrane, resulting in growth cone collapse. Furthermore, Rac 1 antisense injected into the embryonic chick eye in vivo caused the retinotectal projection to develop without normal topography {{in a manner consistent with}} Rac 1 having an obligatory role in mediating ephrin signaling.
