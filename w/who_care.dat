5|$|The {{majority}} of people with chronic pain notice memory and attention difficulties. Objective psychological testing has found problems with memory, attention, verbal ability, mental flexibility and thinking speed. Pain is also associated with increased depression, anxiety, fear, and anger. Persistent pain reduces function and overall quality of life, and is demoralizing and debilitating for the person experiencing pain and for those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> for them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E

In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly.

500|$|.....when English {{gardening}} {{was mostly}} {{represented by the}} innate futilities of the [...] "bedding" [...] system, with its wearisome repetitions and garish colouring, Mr William Robinson chose as his work in live to make better known the treasures that were lying neglected, {{and at the same}} time to overthrow the feeble follies of the [...] "bedding" [...] system. It is mainly owing to his unremitting labours that a clear knowledge of the world of hardy-plant beauty is now placed within easy reach of all <b>who</b> <b>care</b> to acquire it, and that the [...] "bedding mania" [...] is virtually dead.|$|E
500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{paranoia}} behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with mind control, population control, occultism, surveillance abuse, Big Business, Big Government, and globalization arises {{from a combination of}} two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong individualist values and 2) lacks power. The first attribute refers to people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call [...] "agency panic," [...] intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.|$|E

What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, <b>who</b> <b>care</b> deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|Phoenix's {{childhood}} friend Miles Edgeworth, {{who is the}} protagonist of the Ace Attorney Investigations games, is a recurring rival prosecutor character; in addition to him, each new game in the series introduces a new rival: Franziska von Karma is introduced in the second game, Godot in the third, Klavier Gavin in the fourth, Simon Blackquill in the fifth, and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the sixth. The prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status, who favor convictions over finding the truth, and <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about keeping perfect-win records in court. Similarly to real Japanese prosecutors, the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations, issuing orders to the police. Japanese attitudes towards the police force {{are reflected in the}} series, with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde and Mike Meekins. In the world of Ace Attorney, trials only last three days, and usually end with a [...] "guilty" [...] verdict. The outcomes of cases are decided by a judge, based on evidence provided by the defense attorney and the prosecutor.|$|E

[...] The encounter between Milano Collection A.T. and Curry Man was also given a 1/2 star rating with Caldwell commenting that [...] "from a viewer's perspective" [...] it was [...] "too short" [...] and that TNA did not give [...] "enough background on Milano" [...] for the viewers [...] "to care about this." [...] Keller gave the contest between Doug Williams and Masato Yoshino a 1 star rating and quipped that the [...] "win gave Team International 2 points, so that meant that in the standings for those <b>who</b> <b>care...</b> wait. Nobody cares? Okay. Never mind, then." [...] As for the contest pitting Kaz against Último Guerrero, Keller said it was [...] "decent action" [...] and gave it 3/4 of a star.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{generated}} huge {{controversy in}} Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as [...] "profane". According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of [...] "defaming the larger-than-life reputation {{of a historical}} figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world". The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: [...] "The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the historical moment and ignorance of its consequences... It has served the enemies of Latin America, <b>who</b> <b>care</b> only that they can now denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us." [...] Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.|$|E

Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends <b>who</b> <b>care</b> a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|SAS spokespeople say its {{employee}} benefits are provided for business, not altruistic, reasons. The company evaluates new benefits using three criteria: {{whether it would}} benefit the company culture, whether it would serve {{a significant number of}} employees and whether it would save more money than is spent on it. According to academics, the company's practices improve the loyalty, focus and creativity of its staff. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from the Stanford Graduate School of Business estimated that the company saves $60–$80 million annually in expenses related to employee turnover. SAS has an annual employee turnover of three to five percent, while the software industry's average is 20 to 25 percent. According to USA Today, the workplace culture has created [...] "intensely loyal" [...] staff <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about the company's well-being. [...] Even though there are unlimited sick days, the average employee takes only two. The 40,000 free medical visits provided to employees annually are estimated to cost the company $4.5 million USD, but save it $5 million USD due to the employee productivity lost when staff spend their work-hours in waiting rooms at other hospitals.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Safari"'s setpiece {{shows some}} of Springfield's {{citizens}} mistreating the bag boys {{in a grocery}} store, prompting the bag boys to go on strike. The sequence was inspired by an Albertsons store in Los Angeles, whose employees went on strike {{at the time the}} episode was written. The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle. Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode's script. Because of his involvement with the episode, [...] "Simpson Safari" [...] contains several [...] "classic" [...] Swarzwelder-type jokes, according to staff writer Matt Selman. Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor's hut. After Swarzwelder wrote the first draft, the writing staff rewrote the script. When writing the episode, the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic. Commenting on the episode, Selman said [...] "It's kind of a combination of really nice, observational designs and then just [...] things that are deliberately wrong. To anger people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about things being real." ...|$|E
