5|$|New {{material}} was teased in early in October 2014 on NZ radio and Fat Freddy's Drop released Slings and Arrows 17 October 2014. Starting with an 8-bit intro the song blossomed in to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> their most reggae track thus far. The subsequent album Bays was released {{the following year}} on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington {{where the majority of}} the album was written. Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in Wheels and Cortina Motors, which seems like a true evolution, and more soulful moments in Makkan where Dallas already resides.|$|E

The bill was backed by the White House and business groups as an essential tort reform measure that would reduce <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a debilitating number of frivolous lawsuits. The bill was opposed by consumer advocacy groups and trial lawyers who argued that many valid claims against corporations would be dismissed, leaving consumers without legal recourse.|$|E
25|$|April 10, 2001: Pro-Moscow Grozny mayor Beslan Gantamirov {{announced}} that 17 bodies with gunshot wounds {{had been discovered}} {{in the basement of}} a bombed-out dormitory next to Oktyabrskoye city district police station, manned by the OMON special police troops from Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk. The next day Gantamirov {{announced that}} his report was false and there were no bodies found. When explaining his change of heart, Gantamirov said that he learned of the discovery from the same source as the Russian envoy to the region Viktor Kazantsev, who also first confirmed the find, but later denied it. The OMON officer in charge of the station claimed the unit had nothing to do with the disappearance of local residents, adding that mass graves in Chechnya are commonplace. In March 2005, one of the unit's officers, Sergey Lapin, was convicted for the torture of a Chechen man who remains missing. In June 2006, Memorial produced what it says is documentary evidence of a secret torture center {{in the basement of a}} former school for deaf children in the Oktyabrsokye district of Grozny, which the Russian police allegedly used to hold, torture and murder hundreds of people. The activists said they collected the evidence just in time before the building housing the cellar was demolished in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a crude attempt at a cover-up.|$|E

500|$|The city {{remained}} tense while journalists {{invited into}} the city witnessed confrontational scenes between Chinese troops and Uyghurs demanding the release of family members who they said had been [...] "arbitrarily" [...] arrested. Uyghur women told The Daily Telegraph reporter that police entered Uyghur districts in the night of 6 July, burst through doors, pulled men and boys from their beds, and rounded up 100 suspects. By 7 July, officials reported that 1,434 suspected rioters had been arrested. A group of 200 to 300 Uyghur women assembled on 7 July to protest <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> [...] "indiscriminate" [...] detention of Uyghur men; the protest led to a tense but non-violent confrontation with police forces. Rebiya Kadeer claimed that [...] "nearly 10,000 people" [...] had gone missing overnight. Human Rights Watch (HRW) later documented 43 cases of Uyghur men who disappeared after being taken away by Chinese security forces in large-scale sweeps of Uyghur neighbourhoods overnight on 6–7 July, and {{said that this was}} likely to be [...] "just the tip of the iceberg"; HRW allege that young men, mostly in their 20s, had been unlawfully arrested and have not been seen or heard from as of 20 October 2009 ...|$|E
500|$|In February {{the three}} biggest parties partook {{in a debate}} {{organised}} by the Finnish Business and Policy Forum {{in front of an}} audience consisting of people from the field of business. The National Coalition's Katainen said that as a result of February polling there were now four prime ministerial candidates from the four largest parties. However, the True Finns' chairman and MEP Timo Soini was excluded because the various pollings presented at the time were different. All parties insisted that the retirement age must not be lowered from 63. The SDP's Urpilainen said that the party would continue with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a need to cut pensions and that increasing the retirement age is a form of cutting pensions; to support this she pointed out an earlier retirement age law of 65 years and that the age had been lowered. She also added that because of a large proportion of disabled pensioners, younger people should join the workforce quickly after graduation. Katainen and the Centre Party's Kiviniemi said they would consider raising the retirement age to lengthen work careers. Kiviniemi said that [...] "some of the directors of our large corporations are retiring at the age of 59–60" [...] and that, at the same time, [...] "demands are being presented that people should work longer." [...] Urpilainen also said that lowering the value added tax on food was mistake, though she said that it should not be raised either.|$|E

The accounts given by the five defendants differed from one another on the specific details of virtually every major aspect of the crime—who initiated the attack, who knocked the victim down, who undressed her, who struck her, who held her, who raped her, what weapons {{were used in the}} course of the assault, and when in the sequence of events the attack took place. ... In many other respects the defendants' statements were not corroborated by, consistent with, or explanatory of objective, independent evidence. And some of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> simply contrary to established fact.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} allow for enough time to pass the bills {{in the face of}} lengthy {{opposition}} scrutiny, the Abe cabinet extended the Diet session by 95 days from June into September, making it the longest in the post-war era. The bills passed the House of Representatives on 16 July {{with the support of the}} majority LDP-Komeito coalition. Diet members from opposition Democratic, Innovation, Communist and Social Democratic parties walked out of the vote in protest at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> the government's move to force the bills through without sufficient debate and ignore [...] "responsible opposition parties". Abe countered by arguing that the bills had been debated for [...] "as many as 113 hours" [...] before the vote. While common practice in many other parliamentary democracies, a government using its majority to [...] "railroad" [...] controversial bills though the Diet in the face of political and public opposition is a subject of criticism in Japan.|$|E

According to Shockey's financial disclosure form that was filed in June 2006, the payments were part of a [...] "separation/buy out" [...] agreement for [...] "ownership in and undistributed profits" [...] from the firm. Shockey’s lawyers said that they {{sent a letter to the}} House ethics committee in April 2005, in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> an effort to make sure the severance payments made to Shockey were [...] "appropriate."

Hillsborough Castle is where the Agreement had been signed. One month later, Robinson led a loyalist invasion of the village of Clontibret in the Republic of Ireland. Robinson was arrested and charged for his part in the incident. Paisley and many loyalist supporters travelled south to support him during his court appearance in Dundalk. Their singing of loyalist songs outside the courthouse led to rioting, causing Paisley and Robinson to lodge a formal complaint with the Foreign Office about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> inadequate protection.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 November, The Court of Administrative Justice said {{it would}} hold a first hearing on 4 December in a case brought by lawyers and activists against the declaration. Morsi met {{with representatives of the}} Supreme Judicial Council in an effort to settle the crisis over the extent of his powers {{following}} his 22 November constitutional declaration. He agreed to limit his decree on his decisions related to [...] "sovereign matters" [...] only. Morsy [...] "did not give himself judicial power" [...] but did provide [...] "immunity for his presidential decisions," [...] said Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party. Haddad added that [...] "the president himself (is) not immune from judicial oversight," [...] though it wasn't clear in what circumstances that might apply, or if there was anything preventing Morsi from issuing a new decree to forestall that. According to Al-Jazeera [...] "sovereign matters" [...] were widely interpreted to cover the declaration of war, imposition of martial law, breaking diplomatic relations with a foreign nation, or dismissing the cabinet. Activists on Monday camped in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently. In addition to popular outbursts on the street, Egypt's judges reacted. All but seven of Egypt's 34 courts and 90% of its prosecutors went on strike Monday in protest, according to Judge Mohamed al-Zind of the Egyptian Judge's Club. Muslim Brotherhood supporters staged a counter-demonstration, while they were relocated from central Cairo to a location in front of Cairo University in Giza. Egypt's stock market, which had seen a fall of almost 10% on 25 November 2012, recovered some ground on Monday morning.
