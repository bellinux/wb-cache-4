5000|$|In the 17th century, the Netherlands was {{experiencing}} {{a surge of}} freedom and progress, and wanted to expand their colonies in the American continent. Its society, its economy and the arts (which included paintings of great beauty and high artistic level) experienced the benefits of modern capitalism, driven by the ambition of a powerful bourgeoisie. A symbolic expression of this new economy was {{a branch of the}} Dutch West India Company - that would be called a transnational corporation today - <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>influence</b> throughout the world and controlled much of the trade between East and West. A Board of nineteen members appointed Prince Johan Maurits, Count of Nassau, Governor of Pernambuco. It was an auspicious choice for Northeast, because he was a lover of the arts, a versatile and competent talent, with a deep interest in the New World. In 1637 he opened his government guidelines quite {{different from those of the}} Portuguese colonists, declaring [...] "Freedom of Religion and Trade".His entourage contained traders, artists, planners, German and Dutch citizens. He was accompanied by six painters, including Jonh Post and Albert Eckhout.Nassau also created an environment of Dutch religious tolerance, new to Portuguese America and irritating to his Calvinist associates. Nassau was the first to replace sugar production monoculture with an economic polyculture.|$|E
5000|$|Only the {{earliest}} ones, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>influence</b> {{on the development}} of the order, can be mentioned here. The most important is that of the Four Masters, edited at least six times in old collections of Franciscan texts, under the names of Monumenta, Speculum, Firmamenturn (Brescia, 1502; Salamanca, 1506, 1511; Rouen, 1509; Paris, 1512; Venice, 1513). The chapter of the custodes at Montpellier, 1541, had ordered that the solution of some doubts about the rule should be asked for from each province. We know of two expositions of the rule drawn up on this occasion. Eccleston (c. xii, alias xiii, Analecta Francisc., I, 244) speaks of the short but severe exposition which the friars in England sent to the general, beseeching him by the blood of Jesus Christ to let the rule stand as it was given by St. Francis. Unfortunately, the text of this declaration has not been handed down. We have, however, that of the province of Paris, issued on the same occasion by four masters of theology, Alexander of Hales, Jean de la Rochelle, Robert of Bastia, and Richard of Cornwall. The custos Godfried figures only as an official person. This interesting exposition of the rule, and the most ancient, for it was written in the spring of 1242, is short and treats only some dubious points, in conformity with the Bull [...] "Quo elongati" [...] and two later decisions of Gregory IX (1240, 1241). Their method is casuistic. They propose doubts, resolve them, and sometimes leave the questions to the superiors, or invoke a decision of the pope, although they speak twice (c. ii, ix) of the possible danger for the pure observance of the rule, if too many papal privileges are obtained. The work of the Four Masters has had the same effect on subsequent private expositions as the Bull [...] "Quo elongati" [...] had on all following pontifical declarations. The most prolific writer on the Rule of St. Francis was St. Bonaventure, who was compelled to answer fierce adversaries, such as Guillaume de Saint-Amour and others. His treatises are found in the Quaracchi edition of his works, VIII, 1898 (see SAINT BONAVENTURE). The standpoint of St. Bonaventure is observance of the rule as explained by the papal declarations and with wise accommodation to circumstances. He himself exercised great influence on the decretal [...] "Exiit" [...] of Nicholas III.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{included}} in the already extensive list of studies referred to the modernization period in Argentina, focusing on some aspects of economical history in Santiago del Estero between 1870 and 1940, attempting to provide new evidence about an area excluded from the epicentre of the “pampa”. It examines the impact of irrigation and railway systems diffusion on the development of commercial and industrial agriculture, generating a dynamic lands’ market. Sugar cane, medic, cotton and cereals characterized the new irrigable areas during the expansion and they were settled by immigrants. Also, forest work was another general type of production, constituting an agrarian-forest productive complex whose decay can be observed around 1940. The socialdemographic transformations which came together with this economical and social transition are analysed considering the changes in agrarian social types and the social-organizative modifications in agrarian work. They became evident in the stay and peasant exploitation, which from then onwards lived together with landowners, colonists and rural salary earners. Lastly, this paper examines local factors and those belonging to national economy, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>influence</b> in the depression that followed this expansive cycle, identifying economical, sociological and environmental factors which could have determined it...|$|E
