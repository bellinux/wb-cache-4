5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become,</b> but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, {{whose job is to}} make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E
5|$|Unmarried princess Kunti is {{blessed by}} the Sun god {{with a baby}} boy, which she {{abandons}} in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan and is named Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken. He does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted {{on account of his}} lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.|$|E

5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E

25|$|Most {{students}} who pursue the Executive MBA {{have been working}} in the business world for some time. Many are corporate executives who want to advance within their companies. Others are entrepreneurs who want to advance their businesses, and still others are professionals who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> managers rather than practitioners. The program requires 24 months. In 2009, incoming students began following an alternating Saturday schedule and two summer sessions. The change from an alternating Friday/Saturday schedule was made to accommodate students in a challenging economic environment. The first EMBA class graduated in the spring of 1980.|$|E
25|$|Alipin – Today, {{the word}} alipin (or oripun in the Visayas) means slave and that’s how the Spaniards {{translated}} it, too, but the alipins {{were not really}} slaves in the Western sense of the word. They were not bought and sold in markets with chains around their necks. A better description would be to call them debtors. They could be born alipins, inheriting their parents' debt, and their obligations could be transferred from one master to another. However, it was also {{possible for them to}} buy their own freedom. A person in extreme poverty might even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> an alipin voluntarily – preferably to relatives who saw this as a form of assistance rather than punishment.|$|E

25|$|After {{earning the}} right to {{practice}} medicine (German: Approbation), German physicians who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> anaesthetists must undergo 5 years of training, consisting of anaesthesia, ECG and pulmonary function testing, critical care and pain medicine, and also palliative care medicine. The training includes rotations serving in the operation theatres to perform anaesthesia {{on a variety of}} patients being treated by various surgical sub-specialties (e.g. general surgery, neurosurgery, invasive urological and gynecological procedures), followed by a rotation through various intensive-care units. Many German anaesthetists choose to complete a curriculum in emergency medicine, which once completed, enables them to be referred to as , an emergency physician working pre-clinically with the emergency medical service. In pre-clinical settings the emergency physician is assisted by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|Floods in 1870 and 1877 {{destroyed}} the city's bridges (which were rebuilt) and the James River and Kanahwa Canal. That was not rebuilt, but the towpath {{was used by}} the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad, a project conceived five decades earlier. In 1881 not only was that railroad completed to Lynchburg, so was another railroad along the Shenandoah Valley. Lynchburg now had a telegraph, about 15000 residents, and a streetcar system had begun. However, Lynchburg was becoming crowded despite city limits expanded in 1874. Many citizens did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a junction of that valley line and what became the Norfolk and Western Railroad, so the junction was moved to Big Lick, which later developed into the City of Roanoke.|$|E
25|$|A {{person may}} become {{caught in a}} ‘catch-22’ situation: if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a citizen of their new country, but cannot until they have renounced their {{existing}} citizenship, {{they are unable to}} renounce their New Zealand citizenship and the Minister of Internal Affairs will not register the renunciation of their New Zealand citizenship, because the law specifies that a person must already have the citizenship of at least one other country at the time of applying for renunciation of New Zealand citizenship. Therefore, for example, an individual who only has New Zealand citizenship {{will never be able to}} apply for Singaporean citizenship because once her Singaporean citizenship application has been approved, she must first renounce her existing nationality before she can attend a Singaporean citizenship ceremony and officially obtain Singaporean nationality.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 10 May, Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. Chamberlain {{initially}} felt that a change of government {{at such a time}} would be inappropriate, but upon being given confirmation that Labour would not serve under him, he announced to the War Cabinet his intention to resign. Scarcely more than three days after he had opened the debate, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign as Prime Minister. (Despite resigning as PM, he continued to be the leader of the Conservative Party.) He explained to the King why Halifax (who, the King thought, was the obvious candidate) did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Prime Minister. The King then sent for Churchill and asked him to form a new government; according to Churchill, there was no stipulation that it must be a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|The 22 student hostels {{are located}} {{on either side of}} Scholars Avenue, which extends from the {{institute}} gate to the B. C. Roy Technology Hospital. The three earliest halls—Patel, Azad, and Nehru—together constitute the PAN loop or Old Campus, which is located just next to Scholar's Avenue. There are ten hostels for undergraduate male students (MMM, LBS, RP, RK, MS, LLR, HJB, Patel, Azad and Nehru) and two for undergraduate female students (SN/IG and MT). There are a few post-graduate students' hostels including four for women(RLB, Gokhle, Nivedita and SAM) and hostels for research scholars (BCR, VS, BRH and JCB) and a separate hostel for scholars from the armed forces. The Jnan Ghosh stadium and Tata Sports Complex host large-scale sports competitions. The Tagore Open Air Theatre has a capacity of 6,000 people, and is used to host cultural programs. The Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park (STEP) provides infrastructure facilities to alumni who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> entrepreneurs but lack infrastructure to start their own corporation.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} {{football}} practice, he approached ASU baseball coach Bobby Winkles {{and asked if}} he could join the team. Winkles said he would give Jackson a look, and the next day while still in his football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw; in five at bats he hit three home runs. He was allowed to practice with the team, but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the use of freshman players. Jackson switched permanently to baseball following his freshman year, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a defensive back. To hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles offered him a $50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team. Jackson declined the offer stating {{that he did not want}} to forfeit his college scholarship.|$|E
