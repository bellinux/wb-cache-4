The waters between Mudou islet and Jibei islet consist of a deep <b>water</b> <b>abrasion</b> platform, and submerged reefs can be found everywhere in the area, hence, the numerous accounts of shipwrecks. It is said that ancestors who lived on Jibei used to pick up floating stuff from the wrecked ships. But for precisely the same reason, animals and plants under the sea can all enjoy sufficient sunlight, and people above water can also see right to the bottom of the ocean. To ensure the safety of the boats while travelling the dangerous area, the lighthouse was built on Mudou in 1921, when Taiwan was a Japanese colony. An iron-framed lighthouse of 40 metres high, painted in black and white stripes, standing as the tallest lighthouse in East Asia.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the topsoil from some mountain Regosols for their nutrient status {{and loss of}} fertility due to aggregate breakdown, establishing also {{the relationship between the}} nutrient losses, the soil characteristics and the aggregates stability. The aggregate stability varied from 57 to 80 %. The nutrient losses differed among elements and varied from 20 to 96 %. The availability of nutrients directly influenced the quality of nutrient losses, but did not influence the quantity of nutrients lost. K, Mg and Ca were the most susceptible element to the <b>water</b> <b>abrasion</b> (> 85 % of their total loss was due to <b>water</b> <b>abrasion).</b> Instead for C, N, and partly P, important loss occurred because of the water saturation alone and their losses were related to the aggregates ruptures due to fast wetting (r= 0. 98, 0. 99 and 0. 81, respectively). These findings suggest a high vulnerability to soil fertility losses, and that a great depletion can occur even because of rainfall of low intensity, but sufficient to water saturated the topsoil.

40|$|The {{current study}} mainly {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} different tests on the abrasion resistance of concrete mixed with steel fibers and silica fume. The abrasion resistance was assessed at 28, 56 and 91 days on concretes with water-binder ratios of 0. 35 and 0. 55 where in some mixes silica fume was substituted by 5 % of cement by weight. Steel fibers of 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % of concrete volume were also added into the test concrete by replacement of coarse and fine aggregates. The results showed that concrete with higher compressive strength in Los Angeles abrasion tests also had better abrasion resistance. The inclusion of steel fibers into test concrete with a water-binder ratio of 0. 35 resulted in {{a significant increase in}} compressive strength. This concrete also displayed better abrasion resistance and splitting tensile strength than reference concrete; in the test sample with a water-binder ratio of 0. 55, the added steel fibers was unable to effectively produce cementation with the concrete.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} changes in soil {{fertility}} due to the different aggregate breakdown mechanisms and it analyses their relationships in different soil-plant systems, using physical aggregates behavior and organic matter (OM) changes as indicators. Three case studies were investigated: i) an organic agricultural soil, where a combined method, aimed to couple aggregate stability to nutrients loss, were tested; ii) a soil biosequence, where OM chemical characterisation and fractionation of aggregates {{on the basis of}} their physical behaviour were coupled and iii) a soils sequence in different phytoclimatic conditions, where isotopic C signature of separated aggregates was analysed. In agricultural soils the proposed combined method allows to identify that the severity of aggregate breakdown affected the quantity of nutrients lost more than nutrients availability, and that P, K and Mg were the most susceptible elements to <b>water</b> <b>abrasion,</b> while C and N were mainly susceptible to wetting. In the studied Chestnut-Douglas fir biosequence, OM chemical properties affected the relative importance of OM direct and indirect mechanisms (i. e., organic and organic-metallic cements, respectively) involved in aggregate stability and nutrient losses: under Douglas fir, high presence of carboxylate groups enhanced OM-metal interactions and stabilised aggregates; whereas under Chestnut, OM directly acted and fresh, more C-rich OM was preserved. OM direct mechanism seemed to be more efficient in C preservation in aggregates. The 13 C natural abundance approach showed that, according to phytoclimatic conditions, stable macroaggregates can form both around partially decomposed OM and by organic-mineral interactions. In topsoils, aggregate resistance enhanced 13 C-rich OM preservation, but in subsoils C preservation was due to other mechanisms, likely OM-mineral interactions. The proposed combined approach seems to be useful in the understanding of C and nutrients fate relates to water stresses, and in future research it could provide new insights into the complexity of soil biophysical processes. ...|$|E

In comparison to other conventional methods like shot peening, laser shock peening water jet peening offers resistance to corrosion, improved fatigue resistance, simpler control over the process, full coverage of the treated area, flexibility in treating complex areas and eco-friendly environment. Since WJP uses water for improving the residual stresses it is a potential method for treating a variety of materials. The high pressure water jets has the tendency to cause the surface damage if the parameters are not maintained within optimum conditions therefore, optimum conditions must be determined so that surface treatment can be carried out without causing any detrimental effects. Hence, it is necessary to control the peening parameters which are: Jet pressure, Standoff distance, nozzle geometry, nozzle traverse rate and exposure time.

Root hairs were 4. 5 times more abundant and were more distorted on portions of roots from dry layers than from wet layers.
