5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1985, Wiggins {{was traded}} to the Orioles for {{pitchers}} Roy Lee Jackson and Richard Caldwell. Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team had warned Wiggins that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with drugs. She stated {{that it would have been}} self-serving to keep Wiggins after his relapse <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> instead pursue a fresh start with another team. Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by the Padres.|$|E
5|$|Roope, who drowned <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} {{hang on to}} a rope whilst being pulled {{up the side of}} the cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{was close}} friends with Jilly Rizzo, {{songwriter}} Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry and baseball manager Leo Durocher. In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> He swam {{daily in the}} Pacific Ocean, finding it to be therapeutic and giving him much-needed solitude. He would often play golf with Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived, and liked painting, reading, and building model railways.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Navy {{had trained}} {{extensively}} in night-fighting tactics before the war, {{a fact of}} which the Allies were unaware. Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi {{on the night of}} August 8 and August 9, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> employ his night-battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft, which could not operate effectively at night. Mikawa's warships rendezvoused at sea near Cape St. George in the evening of August 7 and then headed east-southeast.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a mid-air collision, losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy. He ejected through the canopy, parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> He would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz was {{recommended}} to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort {{on location in}} Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward {{so that he could}} complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer work, he returned home and took his own life. Remaining shots after Armendáriz left London had a stunt double and Terence Young himself as stand-ins.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E

5|$|As Eliot was {{finishing}} his second poem, World War II began to disrupt {{his life and}} he spent more time lecturing across Great Britain and helping out during the war <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> It was during this time that Eliot began working on The Dry Salvages, the third poem, which was put together {{near the end of}} 1940. This poem was published in February 1941 and Eliot immediately began to plot out his fourth poem, Little Gidding. Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green to recuperate. His illness and the war disrupted his ability to write and he became dissatisfied with each draft. He believed that the problem with the poem was with himself and that he had started the poem too soon and written it too quickly. By September 1941, he stopped writing and focused on his lecturing. It was not until September 1942 that Eliot finished the last poem and it was finally published.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E

5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{stayed on}} Malta {{and took a}} flight in a {{transport}} aircraft on 6 March, winning the shilling bet. He embarked in HMS Defender on 22 March to return to Britain. He toured Egypt and then took a detour to Athens, Greece. The Axis had invaded Greece and Yugoslavia on 6 April and the Battle of Greece {{was on the verge}} of an out come within two weeks and MacLachlan was evacuated back to Egypt. He flew down the Nile River into Sudan and Kenya in a captured German Junkers Ju 52 and piloted the aircraft himself on 24 April. Stopping at various airfields he flew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> On one such occasion he flew a North American T-6 Texan in an aerobatic sortie. He reached South Africa on 10 May. He flew home on a Boeing 314 Clipper via Lagos, Bathurst in Gambia, Lisbon, Portugal, Dublin, Ireland arriving in Bristol on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

5|$|Raj asks Chauthrani to {{take his}} case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer (Paresh Rawal). Initially, {{the bulk of the}} {{evidence}} is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After the tape is proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and the tape is destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice mail to the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power and status, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman Alec Bedser hit three {{consecutive}} fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman {{to replace him}} with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before hitting him into the leg side {{three times in the}} next, yielding a six and two fours. Bradman responded by removing Johnson from the attack. When the off spinner came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back to the bowler <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have hit it decisively. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426. Johnson's two wickets brought two new batsmen were to the crease and precipitated a collapse that saw England dismissed for 496. Johnson ended with 2/89 from 33 overs and was the least economical of the frontline bowlers except Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|William was re-elected to York after Murdac's {{death in}} 1153. When William {{attempted}} to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they {{then went to}} Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William's actions. It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William's death, Robert, once more acting with Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen's choice of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as the new Archbishop of York. Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert's opposition to William, {{there is no evidence}} that Robert was ever thought to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William.|$|E
