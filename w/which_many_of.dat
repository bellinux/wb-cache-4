5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the troops who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E

5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} a pause in the {{conflict}} with France, during <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the new fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} Ibn Mahkan, Salih {{became the}} lord of al-Rahba, and made his allegiance with the Fatimids. Al-Rahba {{was the first major}} territory Salih held and was the touchstone of the emirate he would establish in Aleppo and much of northern Syria. His son Thimal later succeeded him as emir of Aleppo, and al-Rahba became his principal power base from <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his wazirs (advisers or ministers) originated. He was later compelled by the Fatimids to hand over al-Rahba to their ally Arslan al-Basasiri, a Turkish general who revolted against his Seljuk masters and the Abbasid Caliphate. The ceding of al-Rahba to al-Basasiri was the first step in Thimal's loss of the Mirdasid emirate. Together with the loss of Raqqa, it provoked dissension within the Banu Kilab, with Thimal's brother Atiyya resolving to restore the Mirdasid emirate. Al-Basasiri's revolt ultimately failed and he was killed in 1059, prompting Atiyya to capture al-Rahba in April 1060. Later, in August 1061, Atiyya successfully defended al-Rahba from Numayrid advances.|$|E
5|$|Allen played less {{frequently}} in 1932, {{even though he}} wanted to secure {{a place in the}} MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932–33 season. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the second trial was named in the MCC team. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour. Having been named in the team, Allen did not play again in the season. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky {{had helped to}} produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, in <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping cars at Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted as Big Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while sick with the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by 2K Boston (later Irrational Games) and 2K Australia, {{and published by}} 2K Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms in August 2007; a PlayStation 3 port by Irrational, 2K Marin, 2K Australia and Digital Extremes was released in October 2008, and an OS X port by Feral Interactive in October 2009. A mobile version was developed by IG Fun. The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, Ken Levine, and incorporates ideas by 20th century dystopian and utopian thinkers such as Ayn Rand, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley, as well as historical figures such as John D. Rockefeller. The game is considered a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, on <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Irrational's team including Levine had worked previously.|$|E

5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Barbirolli {{made another}} Atlantic crossing, {{avoiding}} {{death by a}} fluke: he changed flights with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; Howard's was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage {{the management of the}} orchestra had ended the arrangement by <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé's former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Café Tea Rooms. Bettys founder, Frederick Belmont, {{travelled}} on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant café in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt {{of the thousands of}} airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.|$|E
