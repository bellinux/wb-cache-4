25|$|The Smart Way Reading and Spelling {{program is}} {{presented}} {{in a series of}} twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text {{on one side of the}} flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>students.</b> Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.|$|E
2500|$|To {{meet these}} goals, the EMMS pursued several {{different}} approaches to medical missions in the UK as it developed. From 1841 to 1851, the EMMS largely funded special lectures {{on the topic of}} medical missionaries and how to serve people in need. [...] The EMMS recorded these lectures and published them for wide consumption. [...] The organization also awarded prizes for the best-written essays on medical subjects. [...] In 1851, the EMMS began giving pecuniary amounts of aid to students studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh. One of the founding directors of the EMMS, Dr. Peter David Handyside FRSE, established a medical mission dispensary to serve the Irish residing in Edinburgh upon the urging of Rev. P. McMenamy. While <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>students</b> as a director of the EMMS, Handyside realized that it could be beneficial to have a field location in which students could work with local residents. [...] To this end, he established the [...] "Cowgate Medical Mission Dispensary" [...] in an old whisky shop in Edinburgh, Scotland on 15 May 1858. [...] This dispensary was later transformed into the [...] "Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society’s Training Institution" [...] on 18 November 1861. [...] The institute was located in one of the worst spots in the city of Edinburgh in order to serve those in dire need. [...] The institute coupled medical and missionary work into the future medical missionaries’ daily routines. The Livingston Memorial Medical Training Institute took the place of the Cowgate Medical Mission Dispensary on 25 January 1878.|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>students.</b> Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
