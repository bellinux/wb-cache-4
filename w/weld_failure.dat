Also, the variation in strength between tensile and shear fillet welds is shown to be dependent upon the extent of weld penetration achieved/ The proposed tensile <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> theory is extended to predict the theoretical failure of the welds in the end plate space frame connection.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis details the investigation into flash butt <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> at Corus, Port Talbot, where the process is used to join coils of steel, permitting cold rolling without interruption. The aim of this work {{was to examine the}} factors which constitute <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> and to determine whether failure could be eliminated. It was shown that <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> cannot be predicted with appreciable levels of confidence with the use of neural networks based on inputs such as steel composition and the thickness and width of the coils to be joined. 817 weld breaks were recorded during 2006, of which all but two were observed during cold rolling. Analysis of the samples provided indicate that in some case the term weld break was incorrectly used to describe what was in fact failure in the base material, away from the joint. Prior to this work there were no reported data on the residual stress levels generated after flash butt welding of sheet steel with a thickness of 2. 5 mm. It is now clear that in addition to the expected tensile stress in the weld, there is also a compressive stress of up to 200 MPa in the base material which extends far beyond the heat-affected zone. This result may go someway to explain why failure in the base material is observed outside the heat-affected zone during cold rolling. Finally, a post-weld heat treatment for a high hardening boron-steel was examined. The heat treatment was intended to supersede previous attempts to reduce the post-weld cooling rate by applying a voltage across the weld to locally heat the region to a desired temperature.

The fluctuating energy deposition resulting from the unsteady thermodynamic and optical properties of copper causes intermittent <b>welding</b> <b>failures.</b> To make <b>welding</b> processes more reliable, failure detection by online process monitoring is a common technology for large-scale welding applications.

40|$|After {{the central}} {{calorimeter}} was {{installed on the}} center beam a cracked weld {{was found on the}} bridge. The weld was a partial penetration between the top rail plate and the T- 1 steel nose section. The crack is fully across the width of the rail plate and the rail is depressed in a concave shape. That is, the depression is deeper in the center and feathers out to zero {{at the end of the}} rail. Upon close inspection it was obvious that there was no penetration of weld metal into the T- 1 material. The assumption is that the T- 1 was not properly pre-heated before welding. The reason for the concave depression comes from the fact that the rail plate rests on the flanges of the 'S' beams and that during welding the plate pulled off the beams. This <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> can not propagate to any other welds and therefore, will not start a chain of failures. Clearly the failure of this weld did not hinder the installation of the central calorimeters. This <b>weld</b> <b>failure</b> occurred on both sides of the bridge. This failure did, however, alert us to check the critical weld on the bridge, S-beam webs to T- 1 nose section, to assure us we had a sound weldment. (Note: it must be used again for both EC's). We contacted M. Q. S. Inspection Inc. (Lab contractor for N. D. T.). A technician from M. Q. S. came to DAB and performed an ultrasonic examination of the welds in question.
