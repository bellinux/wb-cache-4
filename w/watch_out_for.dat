5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to <b>Watch</b> <b>Out</b> <b>For.</b> It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E

They punish abusive husbands, publicly shaming and sometimes beating them. They also <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> and expose dowry beatings, dowry death, rape, child marriages, desertion, depriving girls of education, child molestation, and sexual harassment. They have invaded police stations {{to demand that}} police investigate these matters, {{and other things that}} affect the community such as corruption. India’s police are notoriously corrupt and sometimes only the threat of a full-scale female riot will get them to act.|$|E

5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E

25|$|Reagan National Airport is {{in between}} two {{overlapping}} No Fly Zone so pilots have to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the Pentagon and CIA headquarters. And on takeoff, pilots must ascend quickly and sharply turn left so they don't {{fly over the}} White House. After the attacks of September 11, security forces strongly enforce these rules.

25|$|Harry {{attempts}} {{to find a way}} to free the marquis and marquise, but he is too late. On the day of the September massacres the prisoners throughout Paris are brought out for mock trials and systematically executed, including the Marquis and Marquise de St. Caux. Victor de Gisons, Marie's fiancé who stayed in Paris to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her, sees his father brought out for trial and flies into a rage. Harry succeeds in knocking him out and carrying him away, aided by a sympathetic Parisian who brings Victor back to his home.|$|E
25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> disruptive passengers and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will {{be accompanied by a}} service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|E

25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Sirius gives Harry {{a mirror}} he {{originally}} used {{to communicate with}} James {{while they were in}} separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of Two-way Mirrors that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius's death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in Deathly Hallows when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius's mirror to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Harry in Deathly Hallows. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus's eye), appears and he sends Dobby, who arrives to help Harry escape from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{started their}} {{response}} quickly, but the reintroduction of Broad paid dividends for England {{when he got}} the wicket of Ronchi in the sixth over. It was Guptill who England had to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for,</b> however, following his performances earlier in the series, but it was another newcomer to the England side, Tredwell, who put paid to the New Zealand opener's plans of going the entire series without getting out, bowling him with his fifth ball of the match for 38. Williamson (19) was next to go, trapped plumb LBW by Root for his first ODI wicket. Bresnan then got Munro for a golden duck, before Tredwell had McCullum caught behind for 6, and Franklin edged Broad to gully for 7. Taylor and Nathan McCullum managed to put on a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket before Broad caught McCullum off the bowling of Bresnan. Three overs later, Finn had Southee for 15 and the contest was all but over; Taylor was still in, two runs away from his half-century, but with 92 runs still to get in 12 overs and only two wickets in hand, the task was too much for New Zealand. Taylor gave it his best shot, though, making it to 71 before holing out to Bresnan off the bowling of Tredwell, and Mills added 28 runs of his own, but McClenaghan was unable to hold his own end up for long and New Zealand were bowled out for 253, 35 runs from victory.|$|E

On the last day of filming, Billitteri suggested to not end the film on such a bleak image and told Bava to change it. Bava changed the ending to Boris Karloff's character of Gorka on horseback who cautions the audience to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> vampires.
