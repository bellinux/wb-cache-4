The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer.

After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase.

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him <b>walking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

25|$|In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), {{participants}} are informed {{that they will}} receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen.

Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian <b>walking</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items {{as if they were the}} pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as remembering what items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.|$|E
