5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E

5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the American army had closed in on {{the members of the}} British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi.

Her passion for drama eventually led to a confrontation with her stepfather, who forbade her from participating in further extracurricular activities. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> she had won the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet in a school fund-raising production of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, he gave her an ultimatum to either stay home or not return home.

From there the Byzantine army advanced on Rome, which it captured without a fight. Belisarius sent Constantine and Bessas to capture various outlying towns, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the new Gothic king, Witiges, was marching on Rome, he recalled them.

5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{nearly all of the}} officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E
5|$|The new President invited several Liberals to {{join the}} Conservative ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. One of these was Paranhos, who took the Foreign Affairs portfolio. He was still in Montevideo <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Carneiro Leão had succeeded in having him elected a general deputy in 1853. The new cabinet, albeit highly successful, was plagued from the {{beginning}} by strong opposition from Conservative Party members who repudiated the new recruits from the Liberal side, believing that these did not truly share the party's ideals and were mainly interested in gaining public offices. Despite the mistrust, Carneiro Leão demonstrated great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks.|$|E
5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion.

He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had not told Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{began the}} war as a captain in Connecticut's militia, a {{position}} {{to which he was}} elected in March 1775. His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the siege of Boston that followed the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord. Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York, which he knew was poorly defended. They issued him a colonel's commission on May 3, 1775, and he immediately rode off to the west, arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was {{on his way home from}} Ticonderoga <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> his wife had died earlier in June.|$|E

After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol {{described}} an 1823 incident between Cofresí and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Gerónimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofresí intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofresí assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayagüez, where Goyco was freed. Cofresí explained that he knew Goyco's father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Gerónimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayagüez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofresí's family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis.|$|E

Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
5|$|McCain and Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of the trips until years after they were taken, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
