5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E
5000|$|The family Monimiaceae {{was erected}} in 1809 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. He called it [...] "the order Monimieae", but {{the orders of}} that time <b>were</b> {{equivalent}} to <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> families. He defined the family broadly, to include <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> the Siparunaceae and Atherospermataceae, {{as well as the}} modern Monimiaceae. This circumscription of the family prevailed until the 1990s, but some, such as Robert Brown and John Lindley, recognized the Atherospermataceae as a separate family.|$|R

5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as a pioneer of British ornithology. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the hen harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E
5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf.

5|$|The {{section of}} BL I-75 that follows Woodward Avenue has {{a pair of}} special designations {{attached}} to it. In 1999, it was designated by MDOT as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> a Pure Michigan Byway. Three years later, it was named a National Scenic Byway by the Federal Highway Administration National Scenic Byways Program on June 13, 2002, the only urban road at the time with that classification. It was later upgraded to All-American Road status on October 16, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} M-25 in the City of Bay City was named <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> a Pure Michigan Historic Byway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).

5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and {{he decided}} not to run for reelection in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, and in that year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total of}} 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.|$|E

5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Cubzac {{served as}} a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon castle. Different means of {{crossing}} the river in Cubzac have historically been used, from pontoon bridges and horse-powered ferries to steel and concrete bridges. Part of a vibrant wine region, Cubzac has several wine castles, including the Terrefort castle. It has developed its own sparkling wine, in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> the Café de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region. Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques; {{the first is a}} painting in a church, the other is the ruins of the Four Sons of Amon castle.|$|E
5|$|John Dalton's {{original}} atomic hypothesis {{presumed that}} all elements were monatomic {{and that the}} atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro {{had arrived at the}} correct interpretation of water's composition, based on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> Avogadro's law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process}} of securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains {{the size of the}} directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was given}} {{command of the}} Right Wing of the Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) {{at the start of}} the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan {{separated}} the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority, and acted as though the corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>called</b> Burnside's Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.|$|E
