This is consistent with the results obtained from the independent conventional fracture mechanics test. Finite element simulations of <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> process were also performed. A non-linear elastic constitutive relationship was used to model the starch gels and frictionless condition was assumed at the wire-starch gel contact interface.

40|$|Background and Aim: Orthodontic {{ligature}} <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> are expensive. Methods of sterilization {{should be}} safe considering patients' health {{as well as}} lifetime of orthodontic pliers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the wear of orthodontic ligature <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> after sterilizing with dry heat or steam autoclave. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, thirty ligature <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> from 3 different factories (Dentarum-Germany, RMO and ETM-USA) were sterilized in either dry heat or steam autoclave. The amount of wear at the tip of each plier in both groups was measured with a stereomicroscope and digital photomicrography. Wear was defined as the difference of the initial length and the length after 10, 20, 30 cycles of sterilization measured by the distance from a reference line on the tip of the plier. Three way ANOVA was used to compare wear between the two sterilization groups. P< 0. 05 was considered as the limit of significance. Results: The amount of wear of the ligature cutting pliers' tip after 10, 20 and 30 cycles in dry heat sterilization was 1. 0 ± 0. 16, 0. 98 ± 0. 22 and 0. 94 ± 0. 31 mm respectively. These figures were 1. 16 ± 0. 15, 1. 16 ± 0. 13 and 1. 15 ± 0. 14 mm for steam heat sterilization. The higest wear was observed after 20 cycles of sterilization in autoclavce whereas the lowest was seen in dry heat sterilization after 30 cycles. The differences between the two studied groups were statistically significant (P< 0. 0001). In addition, increasing sterilization cycles decreased the rate of wear in both groups. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study routine autoclaving caused more damage and wear at the tip of the pliers than dry heat sterilization...|$|R

50|$|Diamond <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> (DWC) is {{the process}} of using wire of various diameters and lengths, {{impregnated}} with diamond dust of various sizes to cut through materials. Because of the hardness of diamonds, this cutting technique can cut through almost any material that is softer than the diamond abrasive. DWC is also practical and less expensive than some other cutting techniques, for example, thin diamond wire cost around 10-20 cents per foot ($0.7/m) in 2005 for 140 to 500 micrometer diameter wire, to manufacture and sells around $1.25 a foot ($4.10/m) or more, compared to solid diamond impregnated blade cutters costing thousands of dollars. Thus a 1,000 foot (300 m) spool of diamond wire costs around $200 to manufacture and sells for around $1,250. Selling cost may vary because of wire grade and demand. Other diamond <b>wire</b> <b>cutting</b> can use shaped diamond rings threaded through cables. These larger cables are used to cut concrete and other large projects.|$|R
