Advertised as his final performances, there <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> demand for tickets and Riley {{performed}} before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program, but found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.|$|E

In some circumstance, letters have extremely explicit addresses to them (specifying rooms or locations inside of a building). Other times, {{there is no mention}} of an address, and the owl is simply told to whom to deliver. The Ministry of Magic used owls to deliver inter-office mail within the ministry building, but according to Mr. Weasley, the mess <b>was</b> <b>incredible,</b> so enchanted memos, which fly throughout the building as paper aeroplanes, replaced owls.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the 158 was {{eligible}} for the new World Championship of Drivers. The car won every race in which it competed during that first season of Formula One; it <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> that a car which had originated in 1938 was so victorious, most likely because all the other constructors (as few as there were) had less money to build and develop their cars and the Alfa had so much development time. The Alfa Romeo team included talented drivers such as Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio, the latter of whom later won the World Drivers' Championship five times.|$|E

Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>incredible</b> because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right?

[...] In 2007, Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher described the first time he heard the track: [...] "The second I heard 'This Charming Man' everything made sense. The sound of that guitar intro <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> The lyrics are fuckin' amazing, too. People say Morrissey's a miserable cunt, but I knew straight away what he was on about."

[...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him.

500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{popularity}} in its era, {{the importance of the}} album for the development of punk rock music <b>was</b> <b>incredible,</b> influencing many of the most well-known names in punk rock, including the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, the Clash, Black Flag, Misfits, and Green Day. Billie Joe Armstrong, singer for Green Day, explained his reasoning for listening to the band: [...] "they had songs that just stuck in your head, just like a hammer they banged right into your brain." [...] The album also had a great impact on the English punk scene as well, with the bassist for Generation X, Tony James, saying that the album caused English bands to change their style. [...] "When their album came out," [...] commented James, [...] "all the English groups tripled speed overnight. Two-minute-long songs, very fast." [...] In another interview, James stated that [...] "Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] In 1999, Classic Albums by Collins GEM recognized Ramones as the start of English punk rock and called it the fastest and hardest music that could possibly be concocted, stating: [...] "The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme." [...] In 2012 the album was preserved by the National Recording Registry, deeming it [...] "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant." ...|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it <b>was</b> <b>incredible.</b> Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

But let us hold fast to all we have; and stop all leaks in our faith; lest an opening, but of a hand's breadth, should sink our seventy-fours. The wide Atlantic can rush in at one port-hole; and if we surrender a plank, we surrender the fleet.
