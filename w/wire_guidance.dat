50|$|China {{had begun}} to explore the <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> {{technology}} for torpedoes in the early 1960s but due to the political turmoil in China, the research stopped like many other Chinese research programs. With the progress of Yu-3 torpedo developmental program, Chinese military realized that an ASW torpedo was needed for its conventional diesel-electric submarine fleet {{in addition to the}} ASuW torpedo under development (Yu-4 torpedo). As a result, Yu-5 torpedo was developed, and it was decided to utilize the <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|AGVs (some {{known as}} {{automated}} guided carts or AGCs) use tape for the guide path. The tapes {{can be one}} of two styles: magnetic or colored. The AGC is fitted with the appropriate guide sensor to follow the path of the tape.One major advantage of tape over <b>wired</b> <b>guidance</b> is that it can be easily removed and relocated if the course needs to change. Colored tape is initially less expensive, but lacks the advantage of being embedded in high traffic areas where the tape may become damaged or dirty. A flexible magnetic bar can also be embedded in the floor like wire but works under the same provision as magnetic tape and so remains unpowered or passive. Another advantage of magnetic guide tape is the dual polarity. small pieces of magnetic tape may be placed to change states of the AGC based on polarity and sequence of the tags.|$|R

50|$|This {{electrically}} propelled, 19 in-diameter torpedo was 227 in {{long and}} weighed 2400 lb. The W34 nuclear warhead used in ASTOR had an explosive yield of 11 kilotons. The requirement for positive control of nuclear warheads meant that ASTOR {{could only be}} detonated by a deliberate signal from the firing submarine, which necessitated a wire link. Because of this, the torpedo was only fitted with <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> systems (transmitted over the same link), and had no homing capability. The torpedo had a range of 5 to 8 mi. By replacing the nuclear warhead and removing the <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> systems, the torpedo could be reconfigured for unguided launch against surface targets.|$|E
50|$|Electrical <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> {{dates back}} to the 19th cenutury with some early {{examples}} being the Brennan torpedo and Lay Torpedo. A prototype ground based electrical wire guided torpedo was built by the Germans during World War II.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing the {{difficulty}} of hitting moving ships during the Spanish Civil War, the Germans were first to develop steerable munitions, using radio control or <b>wire</b> <b>guidance.</b> The U.S. tested TV-guided (GB-4), semi-active radar-guided (Bat), and infrared-guided (Felix) weapons.|$|E

Improved single HEAT warhead; {{penetration}} 400 mm versus RHA or 230 mm towards armour inclined at 60° (some publications claimed 9M111M to have tandem HEAT warhead).|$|R
5000|$|The {{power cable}} is severed at launch. However, if a <b>guidance</b> <b>wire</b> is used, it remains {{connected}} through a drum of wire in the tube. Torpedo propulsion systems vary but electric torpedoes swim {{out of the}} tube {{on their own and}} are of a smaller diameter. 21" [...] weapons with fuel-burning engines usually start outside of the tube.|$|R
50|$|Torpedoes may {{be aimed}} at the target and fired unguided, {{similarly}} to an artillery shell, {{or they may be}} guided onto the target. They may be guided automatically towards the target by some procedure, e.g., sound (homing), or by the operator, typically via commands sent over a signal-carrying cable (<b>wire</b> <b>guidance).</b>|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} WWII, all {{forces had}} widely {{introduced}} unguided rockets using High-explosive anti-tank warheads as their major anti-tank weapon (see Panzerfaust, Bazooka). However, these had a limited useful range of 100 m or so, and the Germans were looking to extend this {{with the use of}} a missile using <b>wire</b> <b>guidance,</b> the X-7. After the war, this became a major design class in the later 1950s and, by the 1960s, had developed into practically the only non-tank anti-tank system in general use. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the 9M14 Malyutka (aka [...] "Sagger") man-portable anti-tank missile proved potent against Israeli tanks. While other guidance systems have been tried, the basic reliability of <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> means this will remain the primary means of controlling anti-tank missiles in the near future. Anti-tank missiles may be launched from aircraft, vehicles or by ground troops in the case of smaller weapons.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 39 torpedo was {{the first}} homing torpedo in United States Navy service to use a {{trailing}} wire for mid-course guidance through the submarine's fire control system. The Mark 39 was a Mark 27 Mod 4 torpedo converted for development of <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> techniques, which were eventually incorporated into the Mark 37 Mod 1 and the Mark 45. Due to this development, the Mark 39 was considered obsolete and the remaining inventory was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The missile is steered {{in flight}} by command {{signals from the}} {{launcher}} transmitted over a <b>guidance</b> <b>wire</b> spooled out behind the missile. A xenon lamp on {{the rear of the}} missile allows the NEC manufactured launcher sight unit to compute an offset between the missile position and line of sight to the target, and calculate steering corrections based on this offset.|$|R
50|$|For wire-guided torpedoes, {{the muzzle}} door must remain open because the <b>guidance</b> <b>wire</b> is still {{connected}} {{to the inside of}} the breech door to receive commands from the submarine’s fire-control system. A wire cutter on the inside of the breech door is activated to release the wire and its protective cable. These are drawn clear of the ship prior to shutting the muzzle door.|$|R

We present a technique that can facilitate introducing the guide <b>wire</b> under fluoroscopic <b>guidance</b> and allow for decreased radiation exposure...|$|R
50|$|Fire-and-forget {{is a type}} {{of missile}} {{guidance}} which does not require further guidance after launch such as illumination of the target or <b>wire</b> <b>guidance,</b> and can hit its target without the launcher being in line-of-sight of the target. This is an important property for a guided weapon to have, since a person or vehicle that lingers near the target to guide the missile (using, for instance, a laser designator) is vulnerable to attack and unable to carry out other tasks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of Yu-5 torpedo begun {{around the same}} time of Yu-4 torpedo in the early 1970s, but due to the backward of the Chinese technological and industrial base, the initial tests of <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> was carried out by using steel wire instead of copper wire, just like when it was done {{more than a decade ago}} in the late 1950s. The propulsion {{development of}} Yu-5 torpedo benefited greatly from the US Mark 46 torpedo recovered by the Chinese fishermen for the Otto fuel II research and then some technological supports for license production of Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo in China of the 1985 deal signed between two countries. Other unconfirmed reports have claimed that during the development of Yu-5 torpedo, advanced American and Japanese commercial off-the-shelf technologies at the time were used, and incorporating these advanced commercial technologies was part of the reason of the prolonged development, which lasted almost two decades. In fact, Yu-5 torpedo program started {{around the same time}} with Yu-4 torpedo program but the latter was completed earlier. Another reason for the prolonged development was the Yu-5 was used as a test vehicle for newer technologies for later torpedoes such as the Yu-6 torpedo, for example, optical fiber <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> had been tested on Yu-5 torpedo since 1986 (However, although the tests were considered somewhat satisfactory, it was not adopted for Yu-5 torpedo, which used the traditional copper wire). The Yu-5 torpedo was finally accepted into the service in 1989 and the series production begun the next year in 1990. [...] The torpedo is initially guided by <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> for most of the time, and at the final stage, the guidance is changed to active / passive acoustic homing guidance,and the active / passive acoustic homing guidance would also automatically activates when the wire is accidentally severed before the final stage. Yu-5 is the first domestic Chinese ASW torpedo for conventionally powered submarines.|$|E
50|$|The X-7 {{influenced}} {{other military}} thinkers after the war. By the early 1950s {{a number of}} experimental systems had been developed (for example, Malkara missile), leading to their widespread deployment in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Large numbers of Israeli tanks were destroyed using wire guided AT-3 Sagger missiles during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. <b>Wire</b> <b>guidance</b> has remained the main system for most smaller weapons although newer systems such as laser beam riding have come into use in anti-aircraft and some anti-tank use roles (such as the US Hellfire missile and the Russian AT-14 Kornet).|$|E

50|$|The Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedo, a.k.a. ASTOR, was a submarine-launched wire-guided nuclear torpedo {{designed}} by the United States Navy for use against high-speed, deep-diving, enemy submarines. The 19 in-diameter torpedo was fitted with a W34 nuclear warhead. The need to maintain direct control over the warhead meant that a wire connection had to be maintained between the torpedo and submarine until detonation. <b>Wire</b> <b>guidance</b> systems were piggybacked onto this cable, and the torpedo had no homing capability. The design was completed in 1960, and 600 torpedoes were built between 1963 and 1976, when ASTOR {{was replaced by the}} Mark 48 torpedo.|$|E
5000|$|Another major German missile {{development}} project was the anti-shipping class (such as the Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293), intended to stop any {{attempt at a}} cross-channel invasion. However, the British were able to render their systems useless by jamming their radios, and missiles with <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> were not ready by D-Day. After the war, the anti-shipping class slowly developed and became a major class in the 1960s {{with the introduction of}} the low-flying jet- or rocket-powered cruise missiles known as [...] "sea-skimmers". These became famous during the Falklands War, when an Argentine Exocet missile sank a Royal Navy destroyer.|$|E
50|$|The {{contrast}} seeker had {{a number}} of operational problems as well. Because of the environment they flew in, contrast seekers were generally not suitable to launch from helicopters, which led to experiments using <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> (TOW) or laser homing (Hellfire). Ultimately these systems proved suitable for launch from many types of platforms, and laser guidance in particular has become more widespread. These systems, however, often use the same basic tracking system as part of the laser designator system on the aircraft, keeping the camera or FLIR roughly pointed at the locked target in the same way it worked in the missile seeker.|$|E

50|$|Mercury-Scout 1 was readied {{for launch}} on October 31 from LC-18B. The {{prelaunch}} countdown proceeded normally, but the engine failed to ignite. Pad crews checked out and repaired the ignition circuits {{and the flight}} was reattempted the next day. Control started failing only seconds after liftoff and at T+28 seconds, the first stage started to disintegrate. Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+43 seconds. The failure was traced to a technician who had accidentally installed the <b>wiring</b> for the <b>guidance</b> system backwards, causing pitch signals to be transmitted to roll and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The Cobra has a {{cruciform}} {{arrangement of}} four large forward swept wings. The main {{body is a}} long cylinder, with an underslung launch booster. Each of the wings has a spoiler on the rear edge {{which is used to}} steer the missile. The warhead is {{at the front of the}} missile, behind which is the gyro and guidance circuitry which allows the missile to interpret steering instructions from the operator. Behind the guidance mechanism is the sustainer motor, around which is wrapped the <b>guidance</b> <b>wire</b> which plays out behind the missile.|$|R
50|$|BAT was {{developed}} from the wartime Ordnance, RCL, 3.45 in, replacing it and the Ordnance QF 17-pounder to become the standard anti-tank weapon of the Army in the post-World War II era. The BAT and MOBAT were used until anti-tank guided missiles, such as Vigilant and MILAN, took their place. WOMBAT remained in anti-tank platoons in Berlin to supplement MILAN until the late 1980s, due to the expected engagement ranges should the Warsaw Pact have ever attacked. The <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> of MILAN would also have been problematic in the built up areas of Berlin. It was envisioned that Wombat would be used in 'shoot and scoot' attacks mounted {{on the back of}} stripped down Land Rover vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The Tigerfish {{was fitted}} with both active and passive sonar {{and could be}} {{remotely}} controlled through a thin wire which connected it to the launching submarine. <b>Wire</b> <b>guidance</b> permits a torpedo to be launched on-first-warning, i.e. when a target is first detected at long range. This permits the torpedo {{the time needed to}} close the range while target course and speed is being updated by the submarine's superior sensors and transmitted 'down-the-wire'. The torpedo can also be reassigned to another target or recalled. Typically, wire-guided torpedoes initially run at low speed (in order to maximize their range and to minimize their self-generated noise) while they close the range (the approach speed) and speed up during the attack phase (the attack speed).|$|E
5000|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the Luftwaffe's systems, primarily comprising the series of Telefunken Funk-Gerät (or FuG) 203 Kehl twin-axis, single joystick-equipped transmitters mounted in the deploying aircraft, and Telefunken's companion FuG 230 Straßburg receiver placed in the ordnance to be controlled during deployment and used by both the Fritz X unpowered, armored anti-ship bomb, and the powered Henschel Hs 293 guided bomb, was greatly reduced by British efforts to jam their radio signals, eventually with American assistance. After initial successes, the British launched a number of commando raids to collect the missile radio sets. Jammers were then installed on British ships, and the weapons basically [...] "stopped working". The German development teams then turned to <b>wire</b> <b>guidance</b> once they realized what was going on, but the systems were not ready for deployment until the war had already moved to France.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{is fired}} from the 9P151 {{launching}} post, which has a simple tripod for support. It can also be {{fired from the}} shoulder - but this apparently requires more skill {{on the part of}} the operator. The launching post weighs 10.2 kg. The missile is launched from the tube by a booster rather than the gas generator used on the 9K111 Fagot system, despite both missiles being designed by the same design bureau. The 9S816 guidance system is powered by a thermal battery attached to the launch tube shortly before launch - the missile itself is remotely powered along the <b>guidance</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The missile was {{developed}} by the Nudelman OKB-16 design bureau. It {{was developed}} {{at about the same time}} as the AT-1 Snapper as a heavy ATGM for use on both ground launchers and helicopters. It addressed some of the problems of the AT-1; it was much faster, and had slightly longer range. These improvements were achieved by sending commands via a radio link instead of a trailing <b>guidance</b> <b>wire</b> - which allowed the missile to travel faster. However, it did make it vulnerable to jamming. The missile system was shown to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in September 1964, and accepted for service shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between the line-of-sight of the operator's telescope and the missile's flare was calculated by the computer {{in the base of}} the launcher. Guidance updates were sent to the missile through the transmitter on the launcher platform, and received on small antennas on the rear of the mid-body fins. The operator simply kept the telescope's crosshairs on the target using the joystick, and the missile would automatically fly into the line-of-sight, a system of operation known as SACLOS. The basic concept is very similar to the one used by most anti-tank missiles, with the exception that those systems normally use small <b>wires</b> to send <b>guidance</b> information to the missile, rather than a radio link.|$|R
