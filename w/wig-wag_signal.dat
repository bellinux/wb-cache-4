5000|$|It {{is illegal}} to proceed past an {{alternating}} flashing red (<b>wig-wag)</b> <b>signal</b> at railroad crossings, per the motor vehicle codes of some jurisdictions. However, this same signal indication has a different meaning (stop and proceed when clear) at HAWK beacons.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Wig-wag</b> <b>signaling</b> was {{performed}} during daylight {{with a single}} flag tied to a hickory staff constructed in four-foot jointed sections. Flags were generally made of cotton, linen, or another lightweight fabric and were issued in the following sizes: ...|$|R
5000|$|Myer's [...] "General Service Code" [...] for <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signaling,</b> {{standardized}} in 1864, {{was also}} known as the [...] "four element" [...] code because all of the characters transmitted were composed of from one to four flag motions. (Myer's original method from the 1850s was called a [...] "two element code" [...] because elements were described only in terms of movement from the vertical position.) The flagman took a position facing the station to receive the message and signaled digits [...] "1" [...] through [...] "5" [...] as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Edward P. Alexander, Myer's {{assistant}} in testing the <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signaling</b> system, resigned his U.S. Army commission on May 1, 1861, {{to join the}} Confederate Army as a captain of engineers. While organizing and training new recruits to form a Confederate signal service, {{he was ordered to}} report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction, Virginia. He became the chief engineer and signal officer of the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac on June 3. After becoming the chief ordnance officer for the Army of Northern Virginia, Alexander retained his position as signal officer, but his other duties took precedence.|$|R
50|$|He {{engaged in}} private medical {{practice}} in Florida and then sought a commission as a U.S. Army assistant surgeon (lieutenant), entering service September 18, 1854, posted at Fort Duncan, Texas, and Fort Davis, Jeff Davis County, Texas. His major {{interest of the}} time, besides medicine, was to devise a system of signaling across long distances, using simple codes and lightweight materials. This system of codes using a single signal flag (or a lantern or kerosene torch at night), known as <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signaling</b> or aerial telegraphy, would be adopted and used by {{both sides in the}} Civil War and afterward.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wig-Wag</b> grade {{crossing}} <b>signal</b> (unknown builder, perhaps Pacific Electric signal shops) from Pacific Electric Railroad.|$|R
5000|$|Its general {{offices and}} factory were located at 3355 East Slauson Avenue in Vernon, an {{industrial}} area {{just south of}} downtown Los Angeles. This was an ideal location {{for a company that}} would eventually supply over 7,000 <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signals</b> to the country and the world, as it had great rail access for not only shipping its products out, but for bringing in the raw materials needed to manufacture its products. The Union Pacific's old Los Angeles and Salt Lake line to the harbor ran just east of that location, and the main lines of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe ran by just north of there as well. This probably had {{a great deal to do}} with those three railroads being some of Magnetic Signal's biggest customers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "father" [...] of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was Major Albert J. Myer, an Army surgeon with an {{interest}} in communications by sign language for the deaf and then in signaling over long distances with lightweight and simple to use equipment. He invented a signaling system using a flag (or a kerosene torch for nighttime use) that is known as <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signaling,</b> or aerial telegraphy. Unlike semaphore flag signaling, which employed two flags, <b>Signal</b> <b>wig-wag</b> required only one, using a binary code to represent each letter of the alphabet or digit. Myer was serving at Fort Duncan, Texas, in 1856 when he wrote to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and offered his signaling system to the War Department. Although the chief engineer of the Army, Colonel Joseph G. Totten, supported Myer's proposal, it did not include specific technical details and Davis rejected it. When John B. Floyd replaced Davis as secretary of war in 1857, Totten reintroduced Myer's proposal, and in March 1859, a board of examination was formed in Washington, D.C. The board, presided over by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, was not enthusiastic about the proposal, judging it suitable only as a secondary means of communications over short distances, but it did recommend further testing.|$|R
5000|$|The wig-wag {{is mounted}} atop the washing machine's transmission, where it oscillates {{back and forth}} like a {{railroad}} <b>signaling</b> <b>wig-wag</b> (hence the name). When either solenoid is engaged, a rod catches and engages the transmission in the desired mode.|$|R
50|$|Believing that Early {{could no}} longer muster attacks {{after more than a}} month of battling, Sheridan ordered the VI Corps under Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright to return to the Petersburg siege lines. However, Early's troops arrived at Hupp's Hill, just north of Strasburg, on October 13, {{deployed}} in battle formation, and began shelling Federal camps around Belle Grove plantation. Col. Joseph Thoburn's Union division moved forward to silence the guns and engaged in a sharp fight with Kershaw's division, resulting in 209 Union casualties, 182 Confederate. Sheridan recalled Wright's corps, which by this time had reached Ashby's Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He departed on October 16 for a conference in Washington with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, accompanied by his Cavalry Corps as far as Front Royal, intending that those two divisions would then raid the Virginia Central Railroad. However, Sheridan changed his plan when he was notified that Early was sending <b>wig-wag</b> <b>signals</b> implying that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps might join him from Petersburg. This was disinformation on Early's part, hoping that it would induce the Federals to withdraw down the Valley, but instead Sheridan brought all of his forces back to the camps along Cedar Creek.|$|R
2500|$|All {{that stood}} {{in the path of}} the 20,000 Union {{soldiers}} converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan [...] "Shanks" [...] Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men. Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard's signal officer, observing from [...] southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of <b>wig-wag</b> semaphore <b>signaling</b> in combat, Alexander sent the message [...] "Look out for your left, your position is turned." [...] Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1850s, U.S. Army Major Albert J. Myer, {{a surgeon}} by training, {{developed}} a system using {{left or right}} movements of a flag (or torch or lantern at night). Myer's system used a single flag, waved {{back and forth in}} a binary code conceptually similar to the Morse code of dots and dashes. This is sometimes called the <b>wig-wag</b> method of <b>signaling,</b> or [...] "wig-wagging". More mobile than previous means of optical telegraphy, as it only required one flag and a 6- to 8-foot platform on which to stand the signal corpsman, this code was used extensively by Signal Corps troops on both sides in the American Civil War. (Its first use in battle was by Confederate Lieutenant Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861.) ...|$|R
