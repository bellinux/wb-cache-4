The east front was then the entrance fa√ßade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand and it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|E

25|$|A {{floating}} platform like {{those used in}} the North Sea <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> less expensive. However, GBS had safety advantages for a field located in an extremely inhospitable environment where rogue waves, fog, icebergs and sea ice, hurricanes, and nor'easter winter storms were not uncommon. Because of an industrial disaster at Hibernia {{at the beginning of}} the decade, this was a critical argument.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{forces of}} the federates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> greater in number than Aetius' own Roman army, which had become much smaller by this time. Assuming that the Hunnic and Germanic forces were roughly {{the same size as}} the Roman and federate army, those involved in the battle could be in excess of 100,000 combatants in total. This excludes the inevitable servants and camp followers who usually escape mention in the primary sources.|$|E
25|$|If Denness did not warrant {{selection}} from amongst seventeen {{players on}} the eve of the Fourth Test, the chances are that he was not good enough in the first place to have been in the touring party.

25|$|In {{frontier}} provinces, {{the proportion}} of citizens <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> smaller. For example, one estimate puts Roman citizens in Britain c. AD 100 at about 50,000, less than 3% of the total provincial population of c. 1.7 million. In the empire as a whole, we know there were just over 6 million Roman citizens in AD 47, the last quinquennial Roman census return extant. This was just 9% of a total imperial population generally estimated at c. 70 million at that time.|$|E
25|$|Somerset were bowled out for 318 on {{the first}} day at New Road, but for the efforts of Malaysian Arul Suppiah (who made 72), wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard (74) and the 18-year-old debutant from Taunton, Robert Woodman (46 not out), it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> worse. The Worcestershire bowlers shared out the wickets, and Somerset were in real trouble at 57 for 5, but Suppiah stayed calm and the lower order made good contributions. Nadeem Malik got the best figures for Worcestershire, with three for 63.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} major {{problems}} with this story. First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and {{had the potential to}} ascend the throne. Indeed, since Hongshi was the son forced to commit suicide, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more logical for him to be the adopted son, if any of them were.|$|E

25|$|A July 2010 {{paper by}} Moody's Investors Service's chief {{economist}} Mark Zandl and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder {{predicted that the}} US recession <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> worse without the government intervention. They calculate that {{in the absence of}} both a monetary and fiscal response, unemployment would have peaked at about 16.5% instead of about 10%, the peak to trough GDP decline would have been about 12% instead of 4%. Despite the lack of deficit spending, without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 US federal budget deficit was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{was published in}} the Journal of the Royal United Services Institute and {{a couple of years later}} a shorter article suggested that if the Soviets themselves had used SMAs in swarms in Afghanistan their COIN operations against the Mujaheddin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more successful. Contemporary Western armies in Afghanistan can readily accept that swarming at the tactical and operational levels is appropriate, but the physical structure of the country rules out the currently available fighting vehicles. However, networked and swarming SMAs, again 5,000 in number, all armed with laser designators for the second echelon of conventional ground attack aircraft, would constitute force multipliers with a substantial impact.|$|E
25|$|Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) {{comprise}} an antibody, {{drug and}} a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a tumor antigen) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel endothelial cells. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles {{vary in their}} stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells. Reduced systemic toxicity means that {{they can also be}} used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspected}} Veritas collision <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too <b>far</b> from Jupiter for {{the fragments}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> slung into {{a collision course}} with Earth. However, solar radiation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more active {{than at any other time}} in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17√ó105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250√ó109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Soviets {{in their}} {{invasion}} of southern Sakhalin on August 11 outnumbered the Japanese {{by a factor}} of three but they were unable to advance due to strong Japanese resistance. The Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands took place after Japan's capitulation on August 15, and despite this, the Japanese forces in these islands resisted quite fiercely (although some of them were unwilling to fight due to Japan's surrender on August 15). In the Battle of Shumshu, the Soviets had 8,821 troops unsupported by tanks and without larger warships. The well-established Japanese garrison had 8,500 troops and fielded around 77 tanks. The Battle of Shumshu lasted for five days in which the Soviets lost over 516 troops and five of the sixteen landing ships (most of these ships were ex-U.S. Navy) to Japanese coastal artillery while the Japanese lost over 256 troops. At the end, Soviet casualties totaled up to 1,567 while the Japanese suffered 1,018 casualties, making it the only battle in the 1945 Soviet-Japanese War where Russian losses exceeded the Japanese. If the war had actually gone on, the death toll among the Soviets in their invasion of the Kuril Islands <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> higher and the logistics supply would be severely strained due to lack of Soviet capability to supply its forces and equipment overseas. At the time of Japan's surrender, an estimated 50,000 Japanese soldiers were stationed in Hokkaido. If the Soviets attempted to land at Hokkaido with limited naval capability, it would have run high up to 20,000 Soviet casualties each week, which would have easily destroyed the Soviets' will to wage war against the Japanese.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Unbreakable, and {{included}} {{it on his}} list of the top 20 films released since 1992, the year he became a director.

500|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{was never}} {{released}} outside Japan. Retro Gamer stated in 2011 that localizing {{the game for}} North America or Europe [...] "would have cost a fortune", and that {{the rise of the}} competing PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles diminished the benefits of spending so much on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game. Nintendo Power, a few months after Seiken Densetsu 3 was released in Japan, said that the probability of a North American release for the game was low due to issues of [...] "a technical nature" [...] and that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> too costly to produce at the time. This is further supported by Brian Fehdrau, lead programmer for Square's contemporary game Secret of Evermore, who mentioned that Seiken Densetsu 3 had some software bugs, hindering its likelihood of being certified for release by Nintendo of America without extensive work.|$|E
