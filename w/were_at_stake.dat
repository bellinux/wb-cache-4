5|$|Interest in {{attracting}} the capital grew as people realized the commercial benefits and prestige that <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> New York City and Philadelphia each built houses for the president. State officials in New York offered to cede Kingston, while Maryland officials offered to cede either Annapolis or Baltimore. Also, {{as had been}} the case in earlier debates during the 1780s, regional biases, state pride and local loyalties were potent forces and figured into the contest. There was much maneuvering by northern and southern factions in favor of certain sites, and by interstate coalitions that were formed and dissolved almost daily, as Congress debated the matter during the spring of 1790. More than 20 sites were proposed publicly as candidates for the capital city.|$|E
5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles {{face-to-face}} final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, Triple H {{would begin}} a {{controversial}} feud with Kane, {{leading to a}} match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E

5|$|The Ayyubids {{generally}} employed Kurds, Turks, {{and people}} from the Caucasus for the higher-ranking posts {{of the military and}} bureaucratic fields. Not much is known about the foot soldiers of the Ayyubid army, but the numbers of cavalrymen are known to have fluctuated between 8,500 and 12,000. The cavalry was largely composed of free-born Kurds, Turks, and Turkomans whom Ayyubid emirs and sultans purchased as slaves (mamluks). In addition, there existed Arab auxiliaries, former Fatimid units such as the Nubians, and separate Arab contingents—notably from the Kinaniyya tribe, who were largely devoted to the defense of Egypt. Rivalry between Kurdish and Turkish troops occurred occasionally when leading positions <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> and towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Turks outnumbered Kurds in the army. Despite their Kurdish background, the sultans remained impartial to both groups.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{were well}} aware that their victory was still fragile, and {{that as soon as}} the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E

25|$|On February 9, Kansas, Louisiana, and Washington {{held their}} contests. In the Kansas caucuses, Paul {{finished}} third, with 11% and no delegates.

25|$|After Clinton's {{victory in}} Pennsylvania, the campaigns {{focused on the}} May 6 {{primaries}} in Indiana and North Carolina. 115 delegates <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in North Carolina, and 72 in Indiana. Polling suggested a close race in Indiana, while Obama enjoyed the advantage in North Carolina {{thanks in part to}} the state's large African-American population – a demographic from which Obama was receiving strong support throughout the primary season. Indiana's demographic makeup appeared to favor Clinton, as the state was predominantly white, rural, and culturally conservative. Clinton won states like Ohio and Pennsylvania largely because of just such a voter base. However, there were positive signs for Obama as well.|$|E

25|$|February 9 saw {{voting in}} Louisiana, Kansas and Washington state. Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, {{claiming}} all 36 of the state's {{delegates to the}} national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and the McCain campaign expressed no concern over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator. Louisiana was much closer, but Huckabee won there as well, beating McCain by less than one percentage point. McCain was declared {{the winner of the}} Washington caucuses, where 18 delegates <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> The February 19 primary would determine the other 19 delegates from the state. After the caucuses, Huckabee's campaign indicated that they would challenge the results.|$|E
25|$|Another rivalry, with Stade Bordelais, {{took its}} place, when clubs from outside Paris were finally {{allowed to play}} in 1899. The teams were going to meet in 7 of the next 10 finals, with Bordeaux winning 5 of them. Yet the most heated one was the first Stade won in 1901. Bordeaux won the match 3–0 on a hotly debated try. Afterwards, Stade accused Bordeaux of fielding three ineligible players: earlier in the year, Stade Bordelais had merged with Bordeaux Université Club to become Stade Bordelais Université Club, but three of those new players had not been with the club {{for at least three}} months as the rules dictated. The USFSA ordered a replay, but Bordeaux claimed their honour and honesty <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> and refused it.

Three parties, Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, National Alliance and New Italian Socialist Party, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. Berlusconi after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April, he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point demanded by the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (and to a lesser extent by National Alliance) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction be reduced.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Styles, Flair began informally managing Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Desmond Wolfe as a loose alliance. On the March 8 episode of Impact!, Hulk Hogan and Abyss defeated Flair and Styles when Abyss pinned Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Abyss and Hogan from a beatdown {{at the hands}} of Flair, Styles and Beer Money, Inc. At Lockdown, Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) was defeated by Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 26 episode of Impact!, Flair was defeated by Abyss in a match where Flair's and Hogan's WWE Hall of Fame rings <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> and as a result Flair lost possession of his ring to Hogan. The following week, Hogan gave the ring to Jay Lethal, who returned it to Flair out of respect. This, however, was not enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with the members of Team Flair. After Styles dropped the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Rob Van Dam, then failed to regain it in a rematch and later was pinned by Jay Lethal, Flair adopted Kazarian as his newest protégé, seemingly replacing Styles as his number one wrestler.|$|E
25|$|Cokayne's {{involvement}} with Cromwell then drew {{him into the}} affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together {{with some of his}} relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of novel disseisin. Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a quitclaim, but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their quitclaim from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a recognizance of £1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery.|$|E
25|$|In October, Kane began feuding with Triple H, {{leading to}} a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> In the weeks {{preceding}} the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick.

The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasised before the title match. Triple H defeated Kane at No Mercy, due to Triple H and Flair cheating, unifying the two titles. On the October 28 episode of Raw, Kane defeated Triple H in a non-title Casket match to end their feud. At Survivor Series, Kane participated in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Shawn Michaels. Kane was the 22nd entrant in the 2003 Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final three.|$|E
