25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{academic}} {{criticism of}} the book has sought to appropriate it {{one way or the}} other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O'Brien's embrace of myth and refusal of realism [...] "ensnare him with the second rank", have been in the minority. Vivian Mercier described it in The Irish Comic Tradition as [...] "the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century– with the doubtful exception of Finnegans Wake." [...] Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B.S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to At Swim-Two-Birds. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O'Brien in At Swim-Two-Birds.... We would all be very much poorer without Mad O'Brien's narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour At Swim-Two-Birds as [...] "the primary defining text of the O'Brien oeuvre", the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O'Brien's second novel, the posthumously published The Third Policeman:At Swim-Two-Birds is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> metafictional techniques developed publicly in ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of The Third Policeman.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Greenwood {{cries out}} at the audacity of a player {{dedicating}} to an Earl, without even saying that he has asked leave to dedicate. The mere fact that the dedication was accepted, and followed by that of Lucrece, proves that the Earl did not share the surprise of Mr. Greenwood. He, conceivably, <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earl knew the real concealed author, and {{the secret of the}} pseudonym. But of the hypothesis of such a choice of a pseudonym, enough has been said. Whatever happened, whatever the Earl knew, if it were discreditable to be dedicated to by an actor, Southampton was discredited; for we are to prove that all in the world of letters and theatre who have left any notice of Shakespeare identified the actor with the poet.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} shown, I hope with {{sufficient}} evidence, that a constitution against {{the interest of}} the many is rather of the nature of a grievance than of a law; that of all grievances it is the most weighty and important; that it is made without due authority, against all the acknowledged principles of jurisprudence, against the opinions of all the great lights in that science; and that such is the tacit sense even of those who act in the most contrary manner. These points are, indeed, so evident, that I apprehend the abettors of the penal system will ground their defence on an admission, and not on a denial of them. They will lay it down as a principle, that the Protestant religion is a thing beneficial for the whole community, as well in its civil interests as in those of a superior order. From thence they <b>will</b> <b>argue,</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> end being essentially beneficial, the means become instrumentally so; that these penalties and incapacities are not final causes of the law, but only a discipline to bring over a deluded people to their real interest, and therefore, though they may be harsh in their operation, they will be pleasant in their effects; and be they what they will, they cannot be considered as a very extraordinary hardship, {{as it is in the}} power of the sufferer to free himself when he pleases, and that only by converting to a better religion, which it is his duty to embrace, even though it were attended with all those penalties from whence in reality it delivers him: if he suffers, it is his own fault; volenti non fit injuria.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} propose an {{interpretation}} of Kant's thought based on {{an analysis of the}} well- known Kantian metaphor of the "Tribunal of Reason". 1 By so doing, it <b>will</b> be <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> activity of reason is not foundational, but jurisdictional. The task of reason is not to form the foundation of our frameworks of theoretical and practical knowledge, but rather to form their legitimation. In addition, it <b>will</b> be <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-foundational character of reason is consistent both with its ultimate autonomy and with its established proceedings.

Examples include: abuse topicality arguments (the affirmative is not within the resolution, therefore preventing the negative from running an argument they would have otherwise been able to run) and language kritiks (kritiks condemning the affirmative for using inappropriate or dangerous language). The team making a pre-fiat argument <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pre-fiat argument should be evaluated before any other argument in the round.

500|$|Historian Daniel Belgrad <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> 1880s {{centralized}} {{range management}} was {{emerging as the}} solution to <b>the</b> overgrazing <b>that</b> had depleted open ranges.

Larger ranchers also were hurt by mavericking (taking lost, unbranded calves from other ranchers' herds), and responded by organizing cooperative roundups, blacklisting, and lobbying for stricter anti-maverick laws. These ranchers formed the WSGA and hired gunmen to hunt down rustlers, but local farmers resented the ranchers' collective political power. The farmers moved toward decentralization and the use of private winter pastures. Randy McFerrin and Douglas <b>Wills</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> confrontation represented opposing property rights systems.

50|$|The second {{observer}} <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first observer has {{evaluated the}} endpoints {{of the object}} at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime.

Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again {{a consequence of the}} relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.|$|E
