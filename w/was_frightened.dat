After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a chance {{encounter}} in late spring 1968, according to some accounts, drummer Dennis Wilson was driving through Malibu when he picked up two hitchhiking women of the Manson Family, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, and brought them to his house in Pacific Palisades for a few hours. Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E

In 1854, his second son, William D. Moore (Billie), was born at Callao. However, Hendrika <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> by the ongoing revolutions in Peru, and they returned to San Francisco in 1856.

25|$|By the mid 1870s the LB had {{recovered}} its financial stability through {{a policy of}} encouraging the more intensive use of lines and reducing operating costs. Between 1870 and 1889 annual revenue rose from £1.3 million to £2.4 million, whilst its operating costs rose from £65,000 to just over £1 million. The LB was able to embark upon new railway building and improvements to infrastructure. Some new lines passed through sparsely populated areas and merely provided shorter connections to towns that were already on the railway network, and so were unlikely to be profitable, but the LB found itself under pressure from local communities wanting a rail connection, and <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> that they would otherwise be developed by rivals.|$|E
25|$|This {{was part}} of a broader fear of spirits that might flit into dwellings. Witch bottles were common {{throughout}} Europe – bottles or glass spheres containing a mass of threads, often with charms entangled in them. Its purpose was to draw in and trap evil and negative energy directed at its owner. Folk magic contends that the witch bottle protects against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteracts spells cast by witches, also forestalling the passage into habitations of witches flying about at night. A witch ball was much the same; however, a more light-hearted belief was that the witch saw her distorted face in the curved glass and <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> away. The term witch ball is probably a corruption of watch ball because it was used as a guard against evil spirits.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E
500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter.

[...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should have seen some evidence otherwise.

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe.

[...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon.
