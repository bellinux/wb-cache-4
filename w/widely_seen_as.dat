On May 30, 2015, Beau {{died at the age}} of 46 after a two-year battle with brain cancer. At the time of his death, Beau had been <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the frontrunner to be the Democratic nominee for Governor of Delaware in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Harold Godwinson's {{victory was}} short-lived, {{as only a}} few weeks later he was {{defeated}} by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, in Rome, Emperor Claudius died and was succeeded by his stepson Nero. The Parthian {{encroachment}} {{in an area}} regarded as lying within the Roman sphere of influence worried the Roman leadership, and was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a major test of the new emperor's ability. Nero reacted vigorously, appointing Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a general who had distinguished himself in Germania and now served as governor of Asia, to supreme command in the East.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the {{embodiment}} of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
50|$|Fielding had <b>widely</b> been <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> Laurier's {{successor}} but his {{split with}} the party over the conscription issue cost him the 1919 Liberal leadership convention where he lost to William Lyon Mackenzie King by 38 votes.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, archaeologists <b>widely</b> <b>see</b> post-processualism <b>as</b> an {{accompaniment to}} the processual movement, {{while in the}} United Kingdom, they remain largely thought of as {{separate}} and opposing theoretical movements.

5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), {{originally}} {{known as}} Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 {{years between the}} 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard left from the early 1980s, and was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E

This {{would be the}} last attempt to abolish the council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The clashes have <b>widely</b> been <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{symptomatic}} for {{the high}} tensions among the forces that fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) around Sinjar, and the risk that these tensions could escalate into turf wars, which would degrade any attempts to drive the extremist group from the region for good.|$|R
500|$|The {{sociologist}} Jennifer Snook {{noted that}} {{as with all}} religions, Heathenry is [...] "intimately connected" [...] to politics, with practitioners' political and religious beliefs influencing one another. As {{a result of the}} religion's emphasis on honoring the land and its wights, many Heathens take an interest in ecological issues, with many considering their faith to be a nature religion. Heathen groups have participated in tree planting, raising money to purchase woodland, and campaigning against the construction of a railway between London and the Channel Tunnel in Southeastern England. Many Germanic Neopagans are also concerned with the preservation of heritage sites, and some practitioners have expressed concern regarding archaeological excavation of prehistoric and Early Medieval burials, believing that it is disrespectful to the individuals interred, whom Heathens <b>widely</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> their ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Demir and Baykara v Turkey has <b>widely</b> been <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a {{landmark}} {{case in the}} international development of freedom of association.

Only interference that is strictly necessary in a democratic society can be justified.|$|R
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E

50|$|When the American Locomotive Company (Alco) {{was formed}} through {{the merger of}} several smaller {{locomotive}} manufacturers in 1901, Callaway was selected {{to be the new}} company's first president. The merger was <b>widely</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> positive by the public, so the directors chose Callaway hoping his reputation as a railroad leader would help with public opinion of the company. Callaway was succeeded as president of Alco by Albert J. Pitkin.|$|R
5|$|Khrushchev {{attributed}} his recall to Moscow {{to mental}} disorder {{on the part}} of Stalin, who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated Leningrad case, in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason. Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> Stalin's heirs.|$|E
5|$|Spouge is a {{style of}} Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is {{primarily}} a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by {{a wide variety of}} musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|The Army and Air Force {{had been}} {{involved}} in interservice fighting over missile systems since they split in 1947. The Army considered surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) an extension of conventional artillery, and surface-to-air designs as the modern replacement for their anti-aircraft artillery. The Air Force considered the nuclear SSM to be an extension of their strategic bombing role, and any sort of long-range anti-aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet. Both forces were developing missiles for both roles, leading to considerable duplication of effort which was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> wasteful.|$|E
