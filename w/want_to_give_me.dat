500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Billing {{shook his}} head. [...] "Somebody else might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> one," [...] he said, resignedly, [...] "and I’ve ’ad about all I want to-night." ...|$|E

5000|$|... {{it was a}} life of {{constant}} anxiety, constant hardship and persecution. Nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take <b>me,</b> no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> shelter for the night. When at my good fortune, some kind and compassionate soul I took, she suffered from fear and anxiety.|$|R
60|$|I nursed {{her more}} or less through the whole illness, and {{afterwards}} she fancied she owed me her worthless little life. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the precious emeralds, and when I refused was so heart-broken that I said I'd take one thing if I might.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suspect he}} knew {{something}} about his brother that kept the marquis civil to him," [...] Newman propounded; [...] "he made the marquis feel him.

6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{came out from}} behind the Christmas tree, her stocking, now but half filled, in her hand. [...] "Here I am," [...] she said.

6000|$|... 'How {{good of you}} not {{to forget}} me {{when you are in}} the midst of such dangers and hardships,' {{answered}} she. 'Yes, it is true I have many beautiful things; but if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a present--and to-morrow is my birthday--there IS one thing that I wish for very much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tha-anks awfully; he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> something," [...] he followed. Miss Heythorp was not {{his style}} at all; he {{had a kind of}} dread of that thin woman who looked as if she could never be unbuttoned. They said she was a great churchgoer and all that sort of thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} of {{anything}} but YOU. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I think he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> an opening. I do believe that--poor little exquisite wretch!--he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours {{as if it were}} just coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you shall}} be {{convinced}} that I am so changed {{that it is better}} that I die that I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head, or do whatever else may be <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> rest!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} make my pile by selling the ore to somebody, but you treated me like a white man, and I guess the lode belongs to you. Well, if I help you get rich and you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> something, I won't refuse, but I'm not out for money. Say, you'll let me go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} wait," [...] she said. [...] "If you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> something, I will let you--out of my brother's money, of course, I mean," [...] she added. [...] "I haven't {{anything}} saved at all, or I wouldn't have that. But {{one day you}} shall take me out and buy me a dress and hat. You can tell Arthur directly you write to him. I don't mind that, for sometimes I do feel ashamed--I did the other night to have you sit with me there, and to feel that I was dressed so very differently from all of them." ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. No: I am {{only the}} most impudent person you've ever met. That's your notion of a {{thoroughly}} bad character. When you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a piece of your mind, you ask yourself, as a just and upright man, what is the worst you can fairly say of me. Thief, liar, forger, adulterer, perjurer, glutton, drunkard? Not one of these names fit me. You have {{to fall back on}} my deficiency in shame. Well, I admit it. I even congratulate myself; for if I were ashamed of my real self, I should cut as stupid a figure as any of the rest of you. Cultivate a little impudence, Ramsden; and you will become quite a remarkable man.|$|E

5000|$|Then Felix Saxo {{gave him}} some options: [...] "Either compel her <b>to</b> <b>give</b> offerings <b>to</b> our gods, or <b>give</b> her <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in {{exchange}} for whichever four of my handmaidens please you, or for the price that was set for her." [...] Eusebius replied: [...] "If you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> all your property it would {{not come to the}} value of her service." ...|$|R
6000|$|Newman gave a great rap on {{the floor}} with his stick, and a long, grim laugh. [...] "Good, good!" [...] he cried. [...] "You go {{altogether}} too far--you overshoot the mark. There isn't a woman in the world as bad as you would make yourself out. I see your game; it's what I said. You are blackening yourself to whiten others. You don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> up, at all; you like me--you like me. I know you do; you have shown it, and I have felt it. After that, you may be as cold as you please! They have bullied you, I say; they have tortured you. It's an outrage, and I insist upon saving you from the extravagance of your own generosity. Would you chop off your hand if your mother requested it?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{to these}} letters, {{many of them}} are mere outbursts of feeling; yet they are {{interesting}} as showing the state of the public mind. Many of them are on kindred topics of moral reform, in which they seem to have an intuitive sense that we should be interested. I am not, of course, able to answer them all, but C---- does, and it takes a good part of every day. One was from a shoemaker's wife in one of the islands, with a copy of very fair verses. Many have come accompanying little keepsakes and gifts. It seems to me rather touching and sad, that people should <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> things, when I am not able to give an interview, or even a note, in return. C---- wrote from six to twelve o'clock, steadily, answering letters.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was embarrassed}} by her bedroom: the broad couch {{with a cover}} of violet silk, mauve {{curtains}} striped with gold. Chinese Chippendale bureau, and an amazing row of slippers, with ribbon-wound shoe-trees, and primrose stockings lying across them. His manner of bringing the ash-tray had just the right note of easy friendliness, he felt. [...] "A boob like Verg Gunch would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom, but I take it casually." [...] He was not casual afterward. The contentment of companionship was gone, and he was restless with desire to touch her hand. But whenever he turned toward her, the cigarette was in his way. It was a shield between them. He waited till she should have finished, but as he rejoiced at her quick crushing of its light on the ashtray she said, [...] "Don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> another cigarette?" [...] and hopelessly he saw the screen of pale smoke and her graceful tilted hand again between them. He was not merely curious now {{to find out whether}} she would let him hold her hand (all in the purest friendship, naturally), but agonized with need of it.|$|E

6000|$|To Fribourg Charles {{would not}} go. He braved the French Court in every way. He even {{insisted on a}} goldsmith's preferring his order for a great service of plate to the King's, and, having {{obtained}} the plate, he feasted the Princesse de Talmond, his friend and cousin, the Duc de Bouillon, and a crowd of other distinguished people. {38b} In his demeanour Charles resolutely affronted the French Ministers. There were terrible scenes with Madame de Talmond, especially when Charles was forbidden the house by her husband. Charles was led away from her closed door by Bulkeley, the brother-in-law of Marshal Berwick, {{and a friend of}} Montesquieu's. {39a} Thus the violence which afterwards interrupted and ended Charles's liaison with Madame de Talmond had already declared itself. One day, according to d'Argenson, the lady said, 'You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>ME</b> the second volume in your romance of compromising Madame de Montbazon [his cousin] with your two pistol-shots.' No more is known of this adventure. But Charles was popular both in Court and town: his resistance to expulsion was applauded. De Gevres was sent by the King to entreat Charles to leave France; 'he received de Gevres gallantly, his hand on his sword-hilt.' D'Argenson saw him at the opera on December 3, 1748, 'fort gai et fort beau, admire de tout le public.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Having to {{turn with}} all his might to his new profession, Clive Newcome, one of the proudest men alive, chose to revolt and to be restive at almost every stage of his training. He had a natural genius for his art, and had {{acquired}} in his desultory way a very considerable skill. His drawing was better than his painting (an opinion which, were my friend present, he of course would utterly contradict); his designs and sketches were far superior to his finished compositions. His friends, presuming to judge of this artist's qualifications, ventured to counsel him accordingly, and were thanked for their pains in the usual manner. We had in the first place to bully and browbeat Clive most fiercely, before he would take fitting lodgings for the execution of those designs which we had in view for him. [...] "Why should I take expensive lodgings?" [...] says Clive, slapping his fist on the table. [...] "I am a pauper, and can scarcely afford to live in a garret. Why should you pay me for drawing your portrait and Laura's and the children? What the deuce does Warrington want with the effigy of his old mug? You don't want them a bit--you only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> money.--It would be much more honest of me to take the money at once and own that I am a beggar; and I tell you what, Pen, the only money which I feel I come honestly by, is that which is paid me by a little printseller in Long Acre who buys my drawings, one with another, at fourteen shillings apiece, and out of whom I can earn pretty nearly two hundred a year. I am doing Coaches for him, sir, and Charges of Cavalry; the public like the Mail Coaches best--on a dark paper--the horses and miles picked out white--yellow dust--cobalt distance, and the guard and coachman of course in vermilion. That's what a gentleman can get his bread by--portraits, pooh! it's disguised beggary, Crackthorpe, and a half-dozen men of his regiment came, like good fellows as they are, and sent me five pounds apiece for their heads, but I tell you I am ashamed to take the money." [...] Such used to be the tenor of Clive Newcome's conversation as he strode up and down our room after dinner, pulling his moustache, and dashing his long yellow hair off his gaunt face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had to go}} {{over and}} tell Henry Pollack he was dying. Everybody else was afraid to tell him. They {{expected}} he'd take on turrible, for he's been dreadful determined to live, and been making no end of plans for the fall. His wife thought he oughter be told and that I'd be the best one to break it to him that he couldn't get better. Henry and me are old cronies--we sailed in the Gray Gull for years together. Well, I went over and sat down by Henry's bed and I says to him, says I, jest right out plain and simple, for if a thing's got to be told it may as well be told first as last, says I, 'Mate, I reckon you've got your sailing orders this time,' I was sorter quaking inside, for it's an awful thing to have to tell a man who hain't any idea he's dying that he is. But lo and behold, Mistress Blythe, Henry looks up at me, with those bright old black eyes of his in his wizened face and says, says he, 'Tell me something I don't know, Jim Boyd, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> information. I've known THAT for a week.' I was too astonished to speak, and Henry, he chuckled. 'To see you coming in here,' says he, 'with your face as solemn as a tombstone and sitting down there with your hands clasped over your stomach, and passing me out a blue-mouldy old item of news like that! It'd make a cat laugh, Jim Boyd,' says he. 'Who told you?' says I, stupid like. 'Nobody,' says he. 'A week ago Tuesday night I was lying here awake--and I jest knew. I'd suspicioned it before, but then I KNEW. I've been keeping up for the wife's sake. And I'd LIKE to have got that barn built, for Eben'll never get it right. But anyhow, now that you've eased your mind, Jim, put on a smile and tell me something interesting,' Well, there it was. They'd been so scared to tell him and he knew it all the time. Strange how nature looks out for us, ain't it, and lets us know what we should know when the time comes? Did I never tell you the yarn about Henry getting the fish hook in his nose, Mistress Blythe?" ...|$|E
