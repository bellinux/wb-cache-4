Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E

2500|$|In 1904 Elgar told Dora Penny ("Dorabella") {{that this}} {{variation}} {{is not really}} a portrait, but [...] "the story of something that happened". Once, when Elgar had been very depressed and was about to give it all up and write no more music, Jaeger had visited him and encouraged him to continue composing. He referred to Ludwig van Beethoven, who had a lot of worries, but wrote more and more beautiful music. [...] "And that is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> do", Jaeger said, and he sang the theme of the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 Pathétique. Elgar disclosed to Dora that the opening bars of [...] "Nimrod" [...] were made to suggest that theme. [...] "Can't you hear it at the beginning? Only a hint, not a quotation." ...|$|E
2500|$|West {{attempted}} to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is {{following in the}} footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that [...] "Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence." [...] Because of this view, in February2011, West cited the threat of [...] "radical Islamic terrorists" [...] as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with The Shalom Show how he would work with others [...] "like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam," [...] West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the [...] "antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established." [...] West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were [...] "not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)." [...] In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that [...] "I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> understand, if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth.
