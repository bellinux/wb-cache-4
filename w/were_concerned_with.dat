5|$|Several wrestlers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> Kurt Angle's health {{going into}} his Slammiversary match with A.J. Styles. Despite the concerns, Angle {{appeared}} {{to be out of}} it after the contest but was expected to be alright.|$|E
5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the heavenly bodies, <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{developing}} models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} also well {{received}} by critics. Rowling was praised for her imagination by USA Today writer Deirdre Donahue. Most {{of the negative}} reviewers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the violence contained in the novel and with morality issues occurring throughout the book.|$|E

40|$|Open Science is an {{umbrella}} term that encompasses {{a multitude of}} assumptions {{about the future of}} knowledge creation and dissemination. Based on a literature review, this paper aims at structuring the overall discourse by proposing five Open Science schools of thought: The infrastructure school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the technological architecture), the public school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the accessibility of knowledge creation), the measurement school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> alternative impact measurement), the democratic school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> access to knowledge) and the pragmatic school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> collaborative research) ...|$|R
5000|$|Grammar {{is the art}} of inventing {{symbols and}} {{combining}} them to express thought; logic {{is the art of}} thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.[...] [...]Grammar <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the thing as-it-is-symbolized.

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|The two {{earliest}} codes <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> clerical matters, and Æthelstan {{stated that}} he acted {{on the advice of}} Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the possibility of flooding. The party {{then moved on to}} the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
5000|$|The theory presupposes {{that states}} <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{absolute}} gains, that is, {{states do not}} consider the gains or losses of other states in their utility analysis. In contrast neorealists argue that states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> relative gains. That <b>is,</b> states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the advantages they gain versus the advantages of other states in the anarchic system.|$|R

5|$|Members of {{both parties}} <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{the growth of the}} power of trusts and monopolies, {{and one of the first}} acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, {{sponsored}} by Senator John Sherman of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law. The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power. While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company), and had initiated several other cases against trusts.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{established}} Comayagua, originally called Nueva Valladolid de Comayagua ("New Valladolid of Comayagua") and Valle de Santa María de Comayagua ("Valley of Saint Mary of Comayagua"), {{as one of}} four top-tier gobiernos in Central America {{that served}} as administrative centres for commerce and industry. They established less important centres, such as Tegucigalpa, as alcaldías mayores, and more sparsely colonised areas as corregimientos. A number of indigenous settlements, referred to as pueblos de indios ("Indian villages"), comprised a corregimiento. The colonial corregidor governed the corregimiento, but the Spanish also appointed native officials, including the alcalde (or mayor) and his regidores, or councillors. All levels of colonial government <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the collection of tribute and the organisation of native labour.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E
50|$|While port safety <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{accidents}} that harm {{people or}} property, port security (as {{a part of}} maritime security) <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> deliberate acts intended to harm people or property.|$|R
50|$|If the {{practice}} of Architecture <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the art and science of new building, then {{the practice}} of Interior Architecture <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the alteration of existing buildings for new uses.|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} of appropriate shelter <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> providing suitable housing {{for families and}} communities. It is highly specific to context of culture, location, climate and other factors. In development, it <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> providing housing of an appropriate quality and type to accommodate people in the long term. This is distinct from shelter in relief, which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> providing sufficient shelter to maintain life.|$|R
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states replacing the monarchy in Macedonia (i.e., before the resumption of the monarchy in 148 BC and creation of the Roman province of Macedonia in 146 BC). The Roman-era historians Livy and Diodorus Siculus asserted that the law was originally conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. It {{is also possible that}} the Romans <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148 BC, and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158 BC it may have only reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{newspapers}} Bosanski vjestnik, Bosna, and Sarajevski cvjetnik, the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While {{most of these}} publications <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks. The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić {{on the basis of}} those that were used in Serbia. These include an alphabet book (Буквар), a short Biblical history (Кратка свештена историја), a basal reader (Прва читанка), and the First Knowledges (Прва знања); they were published in 1867 and 1868. Mandić's alphabet book, the printing house's first textbook, was the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic. The First Serbian Alphabet Book (Први Српски Буквар), authored by Vuk Karadžić, had been published in Vienna in 1827. The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools, ranging in subject from grammar, arithmetic, geography and religious teaching, but only four were printed. Although they were based on the textbooks used in Serbia, the vilayet's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{technology}} related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).|$|R

5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the destructive force of earthquakes. It {{was recorded in}} Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesiastical {{structure}} of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope 590–604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland {{and then on to}} the continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} end it {{was decided}} that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the possibility of flooding.

25|$|Later on, many linguistically {{comprehensive}} {{systems were}} made by the Protestants, such as that used for Robert Morrison's dictionary and the Legge romanization.

50|$|There {{are three}} types of E-HRM. These are {{described}} respectively as Operational, Relational and Transformational. Operational E-HRM <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> administrative functions - payroll and employee personal data for example. Relational E-HRM <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> supporting business processes by means of training, recruitment, performance management and so forth. Transformational E-HRM <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> strategic HR activities such as knowledge management, strategic re-orientation.

50|$|In {{the case}} of workers at the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth, doublethink means being able to falsify public records, and then believe in the new history that they {{themselves}} have just rewritten. As revealed in Goldstein's Book, the Ministry's name is itself an example of doublethink: the Ministry of Truth <b>is</b> really <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> lies. The other ministries of Airstrip One are similarly named: the Ministry of Peace <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> war, the Ministry of Love <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> torture, and the Ministry of Plenty <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> starvation. The three slogans of the Party—War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength—are also examples.|$|R
