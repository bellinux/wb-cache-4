5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labor slums who lived away from their families and <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E

These teams interview people <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the hazardous substances and collect samples to test the level of contamination in the environment and in people.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the second-generation Indian immigrants, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the {{cultures}} of foreign land and were more attuned to British policies, were able to work beyond the agricultural sector. These Western-educated skilled professionals were employed by the British in the Colonial Service.

Slowly making their way up, many had achieved respectable positions {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Within a month, {{the part}} with {{asbestos}} was blocked off {{in an attempt}} to prevent it from spreading.

Drama students and teachers were potentially affected due to the location of the asbestos directly in the Fine Arts section of the school. As a response to this, the school district has conducted many surveys and health checks to assure the safety of the students and staff.|$|E

25|$|Distributional {{learning}} {{has also been}} found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to {{the same type of}} contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.|$|E
25|$|After {{the early}} studies that {{reported}} that PCE {{children would be}} severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects. Almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to PCE was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition, use of other drugs, depression, and lack of prenatal care. More recently the scientific community has begun to reach an understanding that PCE does have some important effects but {{that they are not}} severe as was predicted in the early studies. The effects of PCE are subtle but they exist. Most people <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> cocaine in utero are normal or close to it.|$|E
25|$|After {{reading an}} account of a gas attack by the German Army on Canadian and French troops at the Battle of Gravenstafel near Ypres on April 22, 1915, Garner {{hypothesized}} that chlorine gas had been used. Based on research he had performed while at the University of Chicago he believed that activated charcoal would adsorb the gas. After performing a successful test using two of his associates <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> gas in a sealed room while wearing Dr. Garnerâ€™s gas mask, the results were {{turned over to the}} British government. In America thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine Safety Appliances was a chief producer. His mask was later used widely in industry.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of {{the effects}} of {{terrestrial}} forms of ionizing radiation on the CNS has been documented from radiotherapy patients, although the dose is higher for these patients than would be experienced by astronauts in the space environment. CNS behavioral changes such as chronic fatigue and depression occur in patients who are undergoing irradiation for cancer therapy. Neurocognitive effects, especially in children, are observed at lower radiation doses. A recent review on intelligence and the academic achievement of children after treatment for brain tumors indicates that radiation exposure is related to a decline in intelligence and academic achievement, including low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, verbal abilities, and performance IQ; academic achievement in reading, spelling, and mathematics; and attention functioning. Mental retardation was observed in the children of the atomic-bomb survivors in Japan <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> radiation prenatally at moderate doses (<2 Gy) at 8 to 15 weeks post-conception, but not at earlier or later prenatal times.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the dose of the drug is an {{important}} determinant of outcome, in addition to how much is used, for how long, {{and what kind of}} care is rendered after birth. Drug use in the first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome. The effects of PCE later in a child's life are poorly understood; there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five. Some studies have found PCE-related differences in height and weight while others have not; these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are school age. Much is still not known about what factors may exist to aid children <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> cocaine in utero. It is unknown if the effects of PCE are increased once children reach adolescence, or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects. A review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in PCE adolescents, but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{acute and}} late {{risks to the}} CNS from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs) are a {{documented}} concern for human exploration of our solar system. In the past, the risks to the CNS of adults <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues {{as compared to the}} physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS.|$|E

500|$|Service {{members who}} participated in the clean up of {{contaminated}} ships were exposed to unknown amounts of radiation. In 1996, a government-sponsored mortality study of Operation Crossroads veterans showed that, by 1992, 46years after the tests, veterans had experienced a 4.6% higher mortality than a control group of non-veterans. There were 200 more deaths among Operation Crossroads veterans than in the similar control group (12,520 vs. 12,320), implying a life-span reduction of about three months for Operation Crossroads veterans. [...] Veterans <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> radiation formed the non-profit National Association of Atomic Veterans association in 1978 to lobby for veterans benefits covering illnesses they believed were due to their exposure.|$|E
