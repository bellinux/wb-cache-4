5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According {{to the rules of}} the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's {{southern}} provinces, Ajay is {{contacted by}} Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary {{in exchange for}} killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> CIA assets, {{and that he was}} sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.|$|E
5|$|In his {{landmark}} Flora Australiensis (1869), George Bentham {{argued that}} several previously described species <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> {{a single species}} – E. impressa, uniting E. variabilis, a short red-flowered E. campanulata, E. ruscifolia, which had narrow leaves and long flowers, the white-flowered E. nivalis, and short white-flowered E. ceraeflora. He re-classified as a separate species – E. reclinata – several plants that Allan Cunningham had collected in the Blue Mountains and classified as E. impressa.|$|E

5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|Saudi {{officials}} later {{stated that}} {{the names of the}} hijackers <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to 9/11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.|$|E
5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, but <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> electro-mechanical {{games that}} used rear image projection {{in a manner}} similar to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E

5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right.

From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} castles by historians and archaeologists {{developed}} considerably during the 20th century.

The Victoria County History of England began to document the country's castles on an unprecedented scale, providing an additional resource for historical analysis.|$|E
5|$|There are doubts, however, {{whether the}} swords {{known to have}} been at Żółkiew in 1738 and at Nieśwież two years later, <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the same sword. The Radziwiłłs' castle was plundered by the Russian army in 1812 and the {{subsequent}} fate of their replica of Szczerbiec is unknown. This fact cast doubts over the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in the Hermitage. Some experts suspected that the sword possessed by the Russian imperial museum was in fact the Nieśwież replica, not part of the original royal insignia.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{confusion}} over {{the number and}} name of ships {{that were part of}} the Reşadiye class. Some sources report Reşadiye and Mehmed Reşad V as having been different ships; these <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the same vessel, ordered originally under the latter name. Similarly, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is sometimes listed as Fatik or Fatih. Another ship, Reshad-i Hammiss, is sometimes reported to have been ordered in 1911 and cancelled in 1912, though according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet Güleryüz in their authoritative The Ottoman Steam Navy, the Ottomans initially only had ordered one vessel.|$|E
5|$|Tributary {{missions}} from vassal {{states were}} commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities {{to do business}} in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
