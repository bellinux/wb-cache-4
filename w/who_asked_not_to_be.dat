2500|$|Red Dog's {{heritage}} was {{a mix of}} Sioux and Assiniboine. He was {{a member}} of the Lakota tribe, and grew up on Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, in northeast Montana. [...] He blamed poverty on his reservation for his crimes later in life; he said that there were no jobs and he could only make a living on crime. [...] According to a family acquaintance, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named, at age 8 or 10 Red Dog tried to emulate the lifestyle of an older half-brother whom he admired, who as of 1993 was in a federal prison.

2500|$|On 27 September 2011 {{at around}} 2 a.m. in McAllen, Texas, fatal gunshots were {{exchanged}} from one vehicle to another along an expressway. A man named Jorge Zavala and a 22-year-old man {{were victims of}} an attack perpetrated by unknown shooters traveling in a dark-colored SUV from a Chevrolet Tahoe, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and crash along the expressway. The local police did not find a motive for the attack, but sources told The Monitor that Zavala had ties with a faction of the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican border cities of Matamoros and Reynosa, showing signs that his assassination was due to an [...] "internal power struggle" [...] in the organization. Zavala died instantly at the scene, while the other man {{was taken to the}} hospital in critical condition. The McAllen Police Department refused to comment on how many gunshots were fired, but the preliminary autopsy revealed that Zavala died of multiple gunshots, not from the crash. Public records prove that Zavala's criminal history dates back to 1995, while sources familiar with the victim stated that he was a close associate of the drug lord Gregorio Sauceda-Gamboa. A local law enforcement official <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified stated that Samuel Flores Borrego's death and the power struggle in the organization may explain Zavala's death. Hours after Zavala's death, a series of grenade attacks prompted in Reynosa, Río Bravo, and Ciudad Victoria, while an intense gunfight took place in Matamoros, Tamaulipas.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} side of the moral divide, Adeline and her {{children}} stand as shining examples of virtue and nobility– or so it would seem. Hortense ridicules her aunt when Bette mentions her protégé Wenceslas Steinbock, providing a psychological catalyst for the ensuing conflict. Victorin repeatedly expresses outrage at his father's philandering, yet crosses a significant moral boundary when he agrees to fund Mme. Nourrison's plan to eradicate Valérie. As one critic puts it, Victorin's decision marks a point in the novel where [...] "the scheme of right versus wrong immediately dissolves into a purely amoral conflict of different interests and passions, regulated less by a transcendent moral law than by the relative capacity of the different parties for cunning and ruthlessness." [...] The cruelties of the Hulot children are brief but significant, owing as much to their obliviousness (intentional in the case of Victorin, <b>who</b> <b>asks</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> learn the details of Mme. Nourrison's scheme) as to malicious forethought.|$|R

500|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Lightning has disappeared, {{and all but}} Serah {{believe that}} she died with Vanille and Fang to save Cocoon. In reality, Lightning was brought to Valhalla, capital of the Goddess Etro, {{as a direct result}} of Etro's {{releasing}} her and the others from their condition as l'Cie. These events had distorted time and erased Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall. Hoping to atone for the deaths she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning chooses to stay in Valhalla and protect the dying Etro from Caius Ballad, an immortal man with a grudge against Etro. Lightning eventually asks Noel Kreiss and Serah to help her stop Caius from ending time, which he plans to do by releasing [...] "chaos", a supernatural energy controlled by Etro, into the mortal world. Serah and Noel travel forward in time to fix distortions in history caused by Caius' interference, and Serah eventually dies when history is restored. In the DLC episode Requiem of the Goddess, Lightning is defeated by Caius and loses hope after learning of her role in Serah's death. Lightning is comforted by Serah's spirit, <b>who</b> <b>asks</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten.
