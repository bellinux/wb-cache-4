Armee (4th Army). Unteroffizier (a non-commissioned officer) Geißhard claimed his first aerial victory, a PWS-26 biplane, that day. The following day, flying his Messerschmitt Bf 109, Geißhardt had to make an emergency landing behind Polish lines. After several hours in Polish captivity, he escaped during the confusion caused by a German Stuka (Dive Bomber) attack. He reached German lines after <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> five days.|$|E
5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E

25|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>for</b> normal able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

This time Evans' escape was successful when the pair reached Switzerland after <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> 18 nights.|$|E

25|$|Governments now {{recognize}} {{the benefits of}} <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> {{mental and physical health}} and are actively encouraging it. This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously. In the UK, a Department of Transport report found that between 1995/97 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.|$|E

500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E
