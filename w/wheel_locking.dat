5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his third pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, with a time of 1:18.439. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard who qualified 0.098 seconds behind Michael Schumacher's time having battled the Ferrari driver for grid position throughout the session. Barrichello qualified in 3rd position and was happy with his Ferrari. Häkkinen encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and managed fourth. Frentzen, who qualified 5th, had to overcome heavy gusts at the L'Epingle hairpin where he found it difficult to find his braking spot. Villeneuve was sixth with teammate Zonta in eighth. Trulli split them for seventh position. Pedro de la Rosa in an Arrows car and Fisichella completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two hundredths of a second though {{he said that he was}} happy with his car. Ralf Schumacher set the 12th quickest time despite his Williams suffering a lack of mechanical grip. He was ahead of Verstappen who crashed his car at turn 4 which caused a temporary suspension to qualifying. The resultant damage caused him to use his team's spare monocoque. Wurz, in the second Benetton, lost time when he caught the aftermath of Verstappen's collision and was 14th fastest. Salo battled with his rear <b>wheel</b> <b>locking</b> on downshifts and took 15th. He started in front of Irvine in the slower of the two Jaguars. Jean Alesi's Prost qualified 17th despite an engine failure, ahead of Button and Diniz. The Minardi drivers qualified at the back of the grid, covering positions 20 to 22 with Heidfeld splitting them for 21st.|$|E

Michael Schumacher was third fastest, two-tenths of a second in front of Trulli, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve. Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert completed the top ten. Coulthard did not set a lap during the third session as his team changed his engine as it developed an electrical problem. In the final practice session, Coulthard had a trouble-free session and was fastest with a time of 1:18.654. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday and were second and third fastest. Häkkinen was fourth quickest and was unable to improve his time as he passed an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher who was running quicker after set-up changes. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. That was a very exciting session, with me being fastest, then losing it and getting it back again. Towards the end, I was told on the radio that Coulthard was quickest and I was told to keep pushing. I was at turn 10 at the time, which was maybe not the best time to talk! But I did not know what time I had to beat, so I just went for it. The wind was a big factor. It was a side wind and so it affected the downforce and it was difficult to predict its effect. I am very happy that Rubens is third and I think we are well prepared for the race.

After the cessation of running by <b>wheel</b> <b>locking,</b> a rapid increase in adipose tissue growth to a size {{that is similar to}} rats that have never run (i. e. catch-up growth) has been previously reported by our lab. In contrast, diet-induced increases in adiposity have a slower onset with relatively delayed transcriptomic responses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify molecular pathways associated with the rapid increase in adipose tissue after ending 6 wks of voluntary running at the time of puberty. Age-matched, male Wistar rats were given access to running wheels from 4 to 10 weeks of age.

IPA was chosen to assist in the understanding of complex 'omics data by integrating data into networks and pathways. Wheel locked rats gained significantly more fat mass and significantly increased body fat percentage between weeks 10 - 11 despite having decreased food intake, as compared to rats with continued wheel access. IPA identified 646 known transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0. 05) between continued wheel access and <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> In wheel locked rats, IPA revealed enrichment of transcripts for the following functions: extracellular matrix, macrophage infiltration, immunity, and pro-inflammatory.

40|$|Abstract. In road vehicles, <b>wheel</b> <b>locking</b> can be {{prevented}} by means of closed-loop Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). Two output measured variables are usually considered for regulation: wheel- deceleration and wheel longitudinal slip. The traditional controlled variable used in ABS is the wheel deceleration, since it can be easily measured with a simple wheel encoder; however, it can be dynamically critical if the road-surface rapidly changes. On the other hand, the regulation of the longitudinal slip is much robust from the dynamical point of view, but the slip measurement is critical, since it requires the estimation of the longitudinal vehicle speed. In this work a control strategy is proposed, where the regulated variable {{is a combination of}} wheel deceleration and longitudinal slip...|$|E

Wheel deceleration and wheel longitudinal slip are usually considered as regulation for such systems. Wheel deceleration can be simply measured with simple and low-cost sensors, but the dynamics of this regulation loop must be fitted to the road conditions, which are difficult to predict. A regulation loop based on wheel slip is simpler and more robust for ABS applications; however, wheel slip measurement is difficult and also, noise sensitivity is a non-trivial issue.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a multivariable Global Chassis Controller (GCC) design, using LPV/Hinf robust controllers for suspension, active steering and electro-mechanical braking actuators which aim at improving automotive vehicle yaw stability, confort and security performances. The contribution of this work {{is to provide a}} methodology to synthesize such controllers, while tyaking into account the braking actuator limitations and ensuring Hinf performance using an LPV controller. The proposed solution is to schedule the three actions (breaking, steering and suspension) according to the driving situation which is evaluated by a specific monitor. In case of emergency (evaluated by the monitor), the GCC uses the braking system to handle the problem and a specific breaking gain-scheduling allow to avoid <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> To enhance the vehicle stabilisation and performances, the steering actuator can be activated and suspensions control can be set to road handling with the same scheduling parameter, in an LPV strategy, according to dangerousness of the situation. This CCG design methodology helps to save energy because it activate the rear breaking and front steering only at critical driving situations. Time and frequency simulations on a complex nonlinear full vehicle model, subject to critical driving situations, shows the reliability and robustness of the proposed solution...|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{fast moving}} world, {{automobiles}} are facing challenges {{in terms of}} having to survive road accidents, increasing traffic, bad road-conditions and high/express ways. Brake systems {{play a vital role}} in controlling the vehicle speed while avoiding road accidents. The conventional brake systems consist of basically an actuator, transmission and frictional parts. This system is difficult for manipulated control by the driver during emergency and panic braking situations. In particular road and environmental conditions, it requires certain skill to have safe and effective brake control, which is always not possible from all drivers. <b>Wheel</b> <b>locking</b> is a predominant phenomenon during panic braking and this will cause vehicle skidding resulting in injuries and road accidents. In the case of a two-wheeler, being a single-track vehicle, skidding is one of the major causes for fatal road accidents due to loss in lateral balance. As the road safety regulations are becoming more stringent, the anti-lock brake systems (ABS) will replace the conventional brake systems in all road vehicles to avoid accidents and to improve vehicle safety. Early ABS systems, developed in the last 100 -years, use intermittent and cyclic brake pressure control by sensing the wheel speed or wheel-slip as one of the major control inputs. Regulating the brake pressure with a preset threshold value is another method. These ABS systems have used electronics, or hydraulics or pure mechanical control. However, such ABS are not widely used in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles till now, because of several limitations identified as follows: High cost, power supply needed for its operation in the case of intermittent and cyclic brake control, susceptibility to failure in the electronics system, interference from RF signals (from cell-phones for example), uneasiness to drivers from pedal pulsations with pedal noise, heavier weight, increased vehicle vibrations and failure modes of wheels due to torsional vibrations. The present research work is carried out to develop a new mechanical ABS concept, which will address most of the above problems. During braking, the change in rider-input force will change wheel reactions. This change is made proportional to the change in rider input force only upto <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> Such a principle is used to develop the new mechanical ABS. The new concept regulates the output force from the ABS, by sensing the dynamic wheel reactions with increase in rider-response. The ABS output force is regulated by one of the following ways: (a) Slipping-down the lever-ratio or (b) preventing the excessive brake input force. Based on the parameters like less number of parts, least weight, simplicity, reliability, efficiency, durability, time-response, etc., the second method (of preventing the excessive brake input force) has been chosen. Further a new concept of ABS interconnecting system is proposed for usage between the front and rear wheels of the vehicle. This interconnecting system will ensure that the two mechanical ABS systems function at any kind of braking-balance between the front and rear applications. An analytical vehicle model has been developed with several input parameters like mass, geometry, inertia, aerodynamic properties, frictions of road and bearing-supports, road gradients, etc. From this analytical model, the dynamic wheel reactions and limiting adhesion of each tyre for various braking conditions are determined and the results are used to design the mechanical ABS. The same analytical model is used to predict the brake performance like stopping distance, vehicle deceleration and the vehicle speed variation for ideal braking conditions. The new ABS is modelled in Pro-E using the inputs from the analytical model. To evaluate the concept, a functional proto-type is built and fitted on a motorcycle. The ABS is evaluated for its functionality and performance at different road (level surface, up-gradients and down gradients) and environmental conditions (dry and wet road conditions). Using the VBOX II, proximate sensors and load-cells fitted on the vehicle, the vehicle stopping distance, wheel slip and pedal force are measured. The results show that <b>wheel</b> <b>locking</b> does not occur under panic driving conditions, which is the primary objective. In addition, the results show a good agreement with the predicted stopping distance and vehicle deceleration from the analytical model. As there is good scope for this new mechanical ABS for use in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles, further research is needed to make this system work in curvilinear motion & banked surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The pure braking and {{cornering}} forces {{of a given}} tyre on a given wet surface at a given speed are functions of braking slip and slip angle respectively. These functional relationships are of greal importance {{in connection with the}} handling and stability of vehicles and the behaviour of brakes and antilocking devices. When corner-ing and braking occur simultaneously the forces interact and: the functional relationships are modified, with consequent effects on vehicle characteristics. The empirical data available at the Laboratory on these relationships, both for pure forces and for forces in combination, are presented. The known effects of such factors as speed, road surface texture, tread pattern, tread resilience, and tyre construction are reported, but since the work was carried out at various times and for various purposes the coverage is incomplete and uneven. The test vehicle, test procedure and the methods of measuring and evaluating the data are briefly described. Some data have been analysed statistically to discover the dependence of the various frictional coefficients on factors such as those mentioned above. It is believed that greater use should be made of these statistical techniques in future work.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design of an {{anti-skid}} brake controller for a generic fighter aircraft. Antiskid brake controllers prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>locking</b> and maximize the coefficient of friction between the tyre and the ground, resulting in lower stopping distance and time. The frictional force is maximized by regulating the slip. A model for the landing gear is first developed, which consists of the translational and rotational motions of the wheel, the equation for the slip and the elastic landing gear strut dynamics. The elastic behaviour of the landing gear is characterized through its modal frequencies, obtained from a Finite element analysis. As the governing equations are nonlinear, with linear elastic deformations of the strut, feedback linearization is used to design the anti-skid controller. The brake controller is found to work well. Its stability is verified through numerical simulations. Both the plant parameters and the sensor measurements are perturbed up to 10 % from their nominal values. It is seen that the feedback linearization tolerates these variations quite well. The system is exceptionally tolerant to sensor noises. The torsional stiffness of the strut {{is found to be}} more critical than the longitudinal stiffness. Limits on the torsional stiffness that can be tolerated by the controller are found. This determines the limits on the stiffness of the landing gear beyond which gear walk may appear. The thesis concludes with suggestions for future work in this exciting field...|$|E
