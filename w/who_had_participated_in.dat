5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Payá and other MCL activists began {{collecting}} signatures for the Varela Project, a petition drive {{that would become}} his best-known program. Named in honor of Félix Varela, a Catholic priest <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> Cuba's independence struggle with Spain, the Project took advantage of a clause in the Cuban Constitution requiring a national referendum to be held if 11,000 signatures are gathered.|$|E
5|$|Captured {{resistance}} {{members were}} also {{executed by the}} German authorities. Famously, Edith Cavell, a British nurse {{who had lived in}} Belgium before the war, was arrested after helping Allied soldiers to escape the country and was executed by a German firing squad in 1915. Another résistante, Gabrielle Petit, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> various forms of resistance activity, was executed in 1916 at the Tir national in Schaerbeek and became a posthumous national heroine.|$|E

Culbreth wore #42 as an AL umpire, but he had to stop using that number after it was retired in recognition of Jackie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Late at night, the Royalist generals reached York, {{with many}} routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed {{only those who}} were part of the {{garrison}} (in effect, only a few officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city {{on the heels of the}} fleeing Royalists.

5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia {{at the head of}} a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials {{believed to be the}} ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the raid against the Bruneval {{installation}} had two important effects. First, a successful raid against German-occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for the British public, and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill took a personal interest in the operation, and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to hear from Major Frost and several other officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> it. Several medals were awarded as a result.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2013 a {{criminal}} case was opened against the band members <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the Moscow cathedral performance on February 21. On March 3, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, two alleged members of Pussy Riot, were arrested by the Russian authorities and accused of hooliganism. Both women at first denied being {{members of the group}} and started a hunger strike in protest against being held in jail away from their young children. The defendants were held without bail. On March 16, another woman, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who had earlier been questioned as a witness in the case, was similarly arrested and charged.|$|E

She played in the first match against Brazil, in which the Australian team won 52–50, but sat out the second and third matches, {{returning}} to the field for her team's quarterfinal 62–37 victory over Mexico, in which she played 18:38 minutes and scored 5 points. She did not play in either the semifinal match against the United States, which Australia won, nor in the gold medal match against the Germany, which her team lost.|$|E

5|$|The paratroopers lost 2 killed, 8 {{wounded and}} 6 men {{who did not}} return the boats. They were later taken prisoners by the Germans. German reports were found after the war, which made the German loss as follows: The army: 2 killed, 1 serious wound, 2 missed. Luftwaffe: 3 killed, 1 wounded, 3 missing.A member of the French {{resistance}} movement <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the previous reconnaissance in Bruneval was subsequently captured and executed by the Germans.

5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E

He won a bronze medal with another brother, Omar, at the 2009 World Modern Pentathlon Championships and eventually qualified for the 2012 Olympics by virtue of his world ranking. He received a berth during the second round of Olympic allocations, when spots won by nations who qualified more than the maximum two athletes were redistributed. In London he was victorious in 18 of his fencing bouts and was ranked joint-11th after the first round, but then won the swimming event with an Olympic record time of 1:55.70. He placed 33rd and 34th in the riding and combined riding/shooting competition, however, and finished 33rd overall.|$|E

5|$|France {{maintained}} {{close ties}} with President Habyarimana during his years in power, {{as part of its}} Françafrique policy. When the RPF launched the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, Habyarimana was immediately granted assistance from the President of France, François Mitterrand. France sent 600 paratroopers, who effectively ran the government's response to the invasion and were instrumental in regaining almost all territory the RPF had gained in the first days of the war. France maintained this military presence throughout the war, engaging Kagame's RPF forces again in February 1993 during the offensive that doubled RPF territory. In the later stages of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, France launched Opération Turquoise, a United Nations mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for protection of displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger; many Rwandans interpreted it as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled Kagame's advance in south western Rwanda.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, much earlier in than in past years. Cofidis, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the Tour every {{year of their}} existence, were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating {{at the time that}} he may not return to it, Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title. The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|The VPAF High Command {{immediately}} scrambled two {{flights of}} four MiG-17 fighters from the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment, {{followed by two}} MiG-21 fighters from the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment at 2:51pm. The MiG-21 force was led by Nguyen Nhat Chieu with Nguyen Van Coc, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the VPAF's disastrous mission during Operation Bolo, as the wingman. The first and second MiG-17 flights were commanded by Cao Thanh Tinh and Nguyen Van Tho respectively. Once airborne, North Vietnamese pilots maneuvered their aircraft into positions to deploy their new tactic which required the MiG-17 fighters to act as bait, while the MiG-21 fighters attacked from the rear. After Chieu and Coc had departed from Phuc Yen Air Base, they flew at low level and stayed in the ground clutter to avoid detection by airborne radars employed by U.S aircraft. However, the MiG-21’s transponders were detected by an orbiting EC-121 airborne early warning radar surveillance aircraft, and their positions were relayed to the F-4 fighters that were escorting the strike formation, {{but they did not}} respond.|$|E
