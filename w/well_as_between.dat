Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense who expressed contempt for the film. At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times. The film grossed $70million domestically.|$|E
5|$|In the Grand Banks of Canada, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four yachts in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of a yacht. Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> and within Oceanian collections.|$|E

These tracks used {{to be part of}} the former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route when traveling between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport was}} built in 1942 and opened to {{commercial}} flights in 1948. It has undergone significant expansion since then and has employed various innovative technologies, such as common-use facilities. The airport consists of four runways and two passenger terminals: Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Terminal 1 is composed of four concourses, namely the A, B, C, and D Gates; Terminal 3 contains the E Gates. A people mover system is in place between the pre-security area of Terminal 1 and the C and D Gates, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the D Gates and Terminal 3. East of the passenger terminals is the Marnell Air Cargo Center, and {{on the west side}} of the airports are facilities for fixed-base operators and helicopter companies.|$|E
5|$|The name Slavonia {{originated}} in the Early Middle Ages. The area was named after the Slavs who settled there and called themselves *Slověne.

5|$|At {{a session}} of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea—Negroponte, Nauplia, Tinos and Mykonos, and the vassal Duke of Naxos—to prepare ships to take {{possession}} of the city, while the Republic's bailo at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named provveditori (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if the Despot Andronikos were still willing, take over the city and arrange for its defence by hiring mercenaries. After that, Giorgio was {{to go before the}} Sultan, inform him of Venice's acquisition of the city and justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to the Sultan. The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between the Sultan and the Republic, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the Sultan and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks—some 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city—but also a secure flow of supplies.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{morning of}} September 5, {{hurricane}} warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings south of Deerfield Beach, Florida, while tropical storm warnings were extended westward through the western Florida Keys. Later that morning, hurricane warnings were issued {{for most of}} the northwest Florida coast while hurricane watches were lowered for northeast Florida and hurricane warnings were dropped {{for the remainder of the}} northwest Bahamas. That afternoon, all warnings were dropped for southeast Florida south of Jupiter Inlet, while the remaining hurricane warnings along the east Florida coast were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. Hurricane warnings along the coast of western Florida were extended southward to Anna Maria Island. Late that night, tropical storm warnings were dropped south of Bonita Beach including all the Florida Keys. Early on the morning of September 6, all warnings were dropped in Florida south of Englewood and Cocoa Beach. Later that morning, hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings between Indian Pass and Destin as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> Anna Maria Island and the Suwannee River while all remaining warnings were dropped south of Anna Maria Island, as well as the Florida east coast and the Georgia coast. That afternoon, all hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings, with all warnings dropped between west of St. Marks and south of the Suwannee river. On the night of September 6, all remaining tropical cyclone warnings were dropped.|$|E
5|$|I-8 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and is {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System from I-5 to the western junction of SR98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San Diego to the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after the local Native American tribe and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 11,800vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR115, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> SR98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.|$|E

5|$|Sino-Roman {{relations}} {{comprised the}} mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the Roman Empire and Han Empire of China, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the later Eastern Roman Empire and various Chinese dynasties. These empires inched progressively closer {{in the course}} of the Roman expansion into the ancient Near East and simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into Central Asia. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at direct contact are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the Parthians and Kushans, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to Rome, but Gan was dissuaded by Parthians from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded Byzantine embassy in 643 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between Evergreen Shores and M‑123 north of St. Ignace. The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1, 1957; a new section of freeway and an {{interchange}} connected US2 to the bridge. In 1961, another new freeway segment closed {{the gap between the}} Mackinac Bridge and Evergreen Shores sections. At the time, the I‑75 designation supplanted US27 on the bridge, and US2 was shifted to follow I‑75 along the freeways in the St. Ignace area. The former routing of US2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BLI‑75. More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in Sault Ste. Marie as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> Dafter and Kinross. The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M‑123 to Kinross, and the section between Dafter and Sault Ste. Marie. At this time, all of US2's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail (H-63).|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>between</b> the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
