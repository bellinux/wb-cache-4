5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of roads in the Middle Ages, travel by sea was an {{important}} transport corridor. Richard Tylman (or Tillman), mayor in 1581, expanded the port at Faversham, building two <b>wharfs.</b> He became {{a key figure in}} exporting corn, wheat and malt to London from the town.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side <b>wharfs</b> in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an arm was dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal stimulated the local economy. A large brickworks was established near the canal in Great Linford: two bottle kilns and the clay pits can still {{be seen on the}} site. Pottery from the Midlands begins to appear in excavations of dwellings from that period.|$|E
5|$|Wigan Pier, a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, {{was made}} famous by the writer George Orwell. In his book, The Road to Wigan Pier, Orwell {{highlighted}} the poor working and living conditions of the inhabitants during the 1930s. Following the decline of heavy industry in the region, Wigan Pier's warehouses and <b>wharfs</b> became a local heritage centre and cultural quarter. The DW Stadium is home to Wigan Athletic Football Club and Wigan Warriors Rugby League Football Club.|$|E

50|$|The Harbour Board {{purchased}} the timber number 1 <b>wharf</b> in 1915, and replaced {{this with a}} concrete <b>wharf</b> within a year. The number 5 <b>wharf</b> was constructed in 1925 and was the entry/exit point for railway lines extending onto the <b>wharf</b> deck. Plans indicate that the number 5 <b>wharf's</b> deck had two pairs of railway tracks which merged at the junction with the number 4 <b>wharf.</b> The tracks curved onto the <b>wharf</b> deck {{at the southern end}} of the number 5 <b>wharf,</b> and the corner of the <b>wharf</b> was truncated parallel to this curve.|$|R
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their <b>wharfs</b> to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a gross income of just under Â£68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} along the Gulf Coast. Many marine vessels were blown ashore or sunken in Pensacola, and railroads {{in the city}} were severely damaged. Numerous <b>wharfs</b> were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were torn off buildings. Three forts {{in the vicinity of}} Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was shut off. A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and sunken watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} network of caves, including Wookey Hole, underground rivers, and gorges, including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge. The county has many rivers, including the Axe, Brue, Cary, Parrett, Sheppey, Tone and Yeo. These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset. In {{the north of}} the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon. The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport, where there is evidence of two Roman <b>wharfs.</b> At the same site during the reign of King Charles I, river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, 13lumber vessels were beached. A 30mile (48km) {{portion of}} the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was washed away. A {{passenger}} train was blown over 100yards from the track, injuring many passengers. Many boats at the harbor and the <b>wharfs</b> in Lanark were wrecked. The local summer resort of Lanark Inn was blown into the Gulf of Mexico. Large portions of stores and pavilions in the city were damaged. At McIntyre, virtually the entire town was destroyed, except for only two mill boilers. The city of Curtis Mill was completely destroyed. Additionally, the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. A total of fifteen ships either destroyed or beached at Dog Island, including the Benjamin C. Cromwell and James A. Garfield. At least 15people were reported missing. Six drowning deaths were confirmed in association with this storm.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} <b>wharfs</b> and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant <b>wharfs</b> at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E

The <b>wharf,</b> built in the 1980s {{as part of an}} initiative to deliver transport services to the then-newly redeveloped Darling Harbour, was originally part of the Sydney Ferries network. The <b>wharf</b> served as the terminus of Darling Harbour ferry services, until the <b>wharf</b> was decommissioned by Sydney Ferries in October 2010, when services to the <b>wharf</b> were rerouted to King Street <b>Wharf</b> 3 instead. Bass & Flinders Cruises currently handles services to the <b>wharf,</b> which acts as a terminus for Bass & Flinders' Sydney Harbour Eco Hopper services.|$|R
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 18th century a complex of {{building}} had grown up around the original blockhouse, which now had a pier, a dock and two <b>wharfs</b> alongside it, and a large house built by the King's brother, James the Duke of York, after his return to England, as well as the two lines of approximately 20 guns stretching on either side along the river; it had a garrison of a sergeant, 20 soldiers and a gunner on loan from Tilbury Fort. The blockhouse itself was no longer used to mount guns but instead acted as the magazine for the wider fortification, being able to store 2,500 barrels of gunpowder. Under the terms of the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, the number of artillery pieces was reduced to ten, and a survey in 1766 reported that Gravesend was in good condition and equipped with ten 9 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new <b>wharfs</b> and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a Â£2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a Â£2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. <b>Wharfs</b> at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the upper}} basin and Ebury Bridge, the railway hemmed {{in the east}} bank, while to the left there was a saw mill and a wider section with <b>wharves.</b> The saw mill had become a motor car depot and works by 1916, and the whole area {{was part of the}} Ebury Bridge housing estate in 1951. Between Ebury Bridge and Elizabeth Bridge, there were a series of <b>wharves,</b> {{labelled}} Victoria <b>Wharf,</b> Bangor Slate <b>Wharf,</b> Ebury <b>Wharf,</b> Commercial <b>Wharf</b> and Lime <b>Wharf</b> on a wide section of canal, after which it narrowed, and was flanked by a livery stables, Baltic <b>Wharf,</b> Eaton <b>Wharf</b> and Elizabeth Bridge <b>Wharf.</b> The buildings were all still there in 1896, but only Ebury, Lime and Baltic <b>wharves</b> were named. All of them had disappeared beneath the railway tracks by 1916. Beyond Elizabeth Bridge there was a short wide section, flanked by St George's <b>Wharf</b> in 1875 and a narrow section bordered by various types of works. The <b>wharf</b> was called Eaton <b>Wharf</b> in 1896, and the buildings were no longer named. Before Eccleston Bridge, the canal ended, its width reduced by the tracks swinging westwards to reach the western platforms of the station.|$|R

5|$|The wall facing {{towards the}} Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, {{stretched}} {{for a total}} length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during {{the construction of the}} railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, and was about 10metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14gates and 110towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained the quarters allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (mitaton) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081â1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own <b>wharfs</b> (skalai) beyond the sea walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over the Tone, and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the <b>wharfs</b> in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E

25|$|When {{the main}} {{flow of the}} Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed {{through the heart of}} the town became ever more canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the <b>wharfs</b> storage {{facilities}} (werfkelders) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The <b>wharfs</b> and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.|$|E
25|$|The navigable {{portion of}} the river was the major highway of the Colony of Virginia during its first 15 years, facilitating supply ships {{delivering}} supplies and more people from England. However, {{for the first five}} years, despite many hopes of gold and riches, these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors. In 1612, businessman John Rolfe successfully cultivated a non-native strain of tobacco which proved popular in England. Soon, the river became the primary means of exporting the large hogsheads of this cash crop from an ever-growing number of plantations with <b>wharfs</b> along its banks. This development made the proprietary efforts of the Virginia Company of London successful financially, spurring even more development, investments and immigration. Below the falls at Richmond, many James River plantations had their own <b>wharfs,</b> and additional ports and/or early railheads were located at Warwick, Bermuda Hundred, City Point, Claremont, Scotland, and Smithfield, and, during the 17th century, the capital of the Colony at Jamestown.|$|E
