500|$|Timberlake {{decided to}} work with {{director}} Michael Haussman, following his work on Madonna's 1994 music video for [...] "Take a Bow". [...] "It's {{one of my favorite}} videos Madonna's ever done," [...] Timberlake said. [...] "Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A lot of times, Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> thing to see." [...] The video was first shown on MTV's Making the Video on July 25, 2006.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Letters of Transit" [...] {{the seventeenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, stating [...] "What at first seemed {{to be one of}} Fringes nutty number 19s {{turned out to be the}} episode that helped earn the series a fifth and final year. Of course, some may now {{question}} the merits of ringing out the series with a season-long story set entirely in this future dystopia ruled by oppressive Observers. But the single episode that introduced this premise <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> jolt that opened a new front of Fringe mythology and gave us a character that would have a lasting impact, Etta." [...] The episode has been nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).|$|E
500|$|Manne {{is often}} {{associated}} with the once frequently criticized West Coast school of jazz. He has been considered [...] "the quintessential" [...] drummer in what was seen as a West Coast movement, though Manne himself did not care to be so pigeonholed. In the 1950s, much of what he did could be seen as in the West Coast style: performing in tightly arranged compositions in what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> style, as in his 1953 album named The West Coast Sound, for which he commissioned several original compositions. Some of West Coast jazz was experimental, avant-garde music several years before the more mainstream avant-garde playing of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman (Manne also recorded with Coleman in 1959); a good deal of Manne's work with Jimmy Giuffre was of this kind. Critics would condemn much of this music as overly cerebral.|$|E

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of co-executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz, {{he came up with}} a new idea. Spotnitz was inspired by an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, called [...] "The Night the Roof Fell In", in which the characters of Rob and Laura Petrie tell different versions of a fight they have had. Gilligan said of the idea, [...] "I just thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> way to tell a story." [...] With two versions of the same story taking up much of the episode, Gilligan knew {{that he would have to}} keep the plot simple and settled on a vampire story, that everyone would easily understand. Both Mulder and Scully's version of the episode were filmed back to back, utilizing the [...] "exact same sets and camera angles". The RV park that was featured in the episode was formerly the site of a sawmill that had previously been used in the fourth season episode [...] "Gethsemane" [...] that had burned down.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really funny, because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It has a sense of humor in the video." [...] The nighttime version was released as the song's official music video to download digitally on 1 February 2011.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{video was}} a source of {{inspiration}} for Justin Timberlake's music video for his 2006 single, [...] "SexyBack". According to Timberlake, he decided to work with director Michael Haussman on his [...] "SexyBack" [...] video because [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is one of his favorite Madonna videos. He went on to say [...] "Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A lot of times, Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> thing to see." [...] According to director Dave Meyers, the music video for Britney Spears' 2009 single [...] "Radar" [...] is a [...] "tribute" [...] to Madonna's [...] "Take a Bow" [...] video. When speaking of Spears and the [...] "Radar" [...] video, Meyers explained, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's [...] video. Britney hasn't done anything like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to {{say anything at all}} to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it at first I thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – and he looks just like him, too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E

500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

2500|$|Cricket {{historian}} J Neville Turner said: [...] "Miller’s Luck is {{up there}} with the great cricket biographies. The sensitive areas are handled with integrity and discretion." [...] Ron Reed, leading Australian sports writer, in a syndicated piece for all News Corporation tabloids including the Melbourne Herald Sun wrote: ‘Miller’s Luck is an excellent biography. It’s an honest portrayal of the imperfect human being behind the heroic legend.’ AAP’s Jim Morton wrote: ‘Keith Miller is an enlightening biography of the test all-rounder, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> and carefree match-winner on the field and a playboy philanderer off it.’ Jim Rosenthal in the UK Daily Mail ranked the book as the number one sports book of 2006. The UK Cricket Society named it as the cricket biography of the year and it was short-listed for the Cricket Writers’ book of the Year. Archie Mac on Cricket Web’s book review wrote: ‘This is Roland Perry’s eighth book on cricket, and for my money his best…the result is not just a great cricketing book, but also a complete portrait of a fascinating life.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. I suppose it was one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher at a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles. Asher {{was at the time}} a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friends. In December 1965, he contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something [...] "completely different" [...] with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together. Wilson played some of the music he had recently recorded and gave a cassette to Asher containing the backing track to a piece called [...] "In My Childhood". The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and the success of the piece convinced Wilson that Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for. When Wilson was asked why he felt Asher was the right collaborator: [...] "Oh, a lot of reasons. One, I thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> person. Two, anybody that hung out with [...] Loren Schwartz was a very brainy guy, a real verbal type person. I just felt that there was something there that had to be, you know, that really had to be." ...|$|E
