I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them.... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
25|$|He {{offered me}} $75,000 {{to kill his}} friend. The last {{envelope}} and letter contained a round-trip airline ticket, first class, United. Plus there was $5,000 wrapped in a little package, fifty and hundred dollar bills. I tell you the honest truth, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that money I didn't believe it was real.|$|E
25|$|Now, Six {{of these}} works were {{illustrated}} entirely by me, and one-Windsor Castle-partly so, numbering altogether ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR {{of the very best}} designs and etchings which I have ever produced; and yet, in this Biographical Sketch, my name is not mentioned in any way as connected with these works-which omission, I thought, was not only very ungenerous, but also very unjust... And, when it was announced that Mr. Andrew Halliday had dramatized Ainsworth's 'Miser's Daughter,' I went to see the performance; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> represented on the stage scenes and characters which had emanated from me, I then publicly claimed to be the originator of that romance, and to have suggested the original idea and characters to Mr. Ainsworth.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness.

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called the}} film [...] "extraordinary" [...] {{and gave it}} four stars out of four. [...] "Watching Avatar, I felt sort of the same as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Star Wars in 1977," [...] he said, adding that like Star Wars and , the film [...] "employs a new {{generation}} of special effects" [...] and it [...] "is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message".|$|E

He was quoted in Kerrang! in 1984 as saying, [...] "I looked at the cover and puked." [...] In an interview supporting Deep Purple's reformation in 1984, he stated of Born Again, [...] "They had sent me a box of records. And, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the cover, and heard the mix, I smashed {{every single one of}} them to pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Texas {{switched}} to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290yards, including 216yards and threelong touchdown runs in the fourthquarter. [...] His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms. [...] Charles explained [...] "It was my time to show everyone what I can do. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a hole, I blasted through it."

[...] It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event {{as a result of a}} crew member collapsing mid-race.

I just felt they were unfriendly so I turned and ran." [...] She recounted how one of them stood up and stamped his feet as if to chase her. [...] "I later {{realized that he was}} just making fun of me." [...] She said she only found out hours later that she was the cause of the violence.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{featured}} {{the first meeting}} of Daenerys Targaryen and Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and Yara's first meeting with Tyrion Lannister. Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

[...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R.

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that pic, I thought, 'That's me!'
