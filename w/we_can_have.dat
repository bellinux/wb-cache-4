25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} {{the events of the past}} that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{an idea of}} {{the quality}} of the {{university}} in what were seeing what some of his professors. Among the most famous, who are many, just to cite Estius (1542–1613), the famous commentator of the epistles of Paul. After classical studies at Utrecht, he then spent two decades in Leuven, studying philosophy, theology and Scripture and in 1580 he received the degree of doctor of theology. In 1582 he became professor of theology at Douai, a position he held for thirty-one years, and he joined her in the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the university, while also being the many years rector of the diocesan seminary. The works of Estius were written in Latin and for the most part, their publications were posthumous. Note also Lessius Leonardus (1554–1623), professing the philosophy, and Francois du Bois, said Franciscus Sylvius (1581–1649) , professor of theology and vice-chancellor of the university, but also Nemius Gaspard Dubois, George Colveneere, and Philippe Bossuet Cospéan which involved in the controversy of Douai.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, showrunners Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters {{confirmed}} that Agent Carter {{was not intended}} to be a miniseries, and that a possible second season would not necessarily be limited to eight episodes like the first.

Later in May, Hayley Atwell stated the season would consist of 10 episodes.

Kirkwood also devised the plot to show of Coopers skills in playing tragedy, of this he commented: [...] "It'll also give Claire Cooper and Nick Pickard another opportunity to show off their acting talents.

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out.

At this time, Nixon sent his adviser, former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, on a fact finding trip to Europe to gather intelligence on Western alliance and Soviet issues. In response to Humphrey's calls for a face to face debate, Nixon remarked: [...] "Before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a debate between Nixon and Humphrey, Humphrey's got to settle his debate with himself." [...] Nixon campaigned in San Francisco, in front of 10,000 supporters amidst an array of protests. The candidate took on the protesters first hand, and delivered his [...] "forgotten American" [...] speech, declaring that election day would be [...] "a day of protest for the forgotten American," [...] a group which included those that [...] "obey the law, pay their taxes, go to church, send their children to school, love their country and demand new leadership." [...] By month's end, many in the Nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed, beginning to prepare for the transition period, despite Nixon's warning that [...] "the one thing that can beat us now is overconfidence." [...] Gallup showed Nixon leading Humphrey 43% to 28% at the end of September.|$|E
500|$|In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) {{federation}} {{was approved}} and Fred Gardiner was named {{as its first}} chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that {{would be needed to}} put the highway through. [...] "We'll move the railway over a piece. We'll tear down the hill. We'll shift the river over a piece, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> the highway through there." [...] Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city's expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic Grand Central Parkway, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them. The first Metro staff survey and feasibility study of the parkway's route was approved in late 1953, before the Metro government itself came into being in 1954.|$|E

500|$|Remarking on the band's {{goals for}} the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] music video, Yorke said that, [...] "When {{it came time to}} make the video for that song, we had lots of people saying, 'Yeah, great, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> another video like [...] "Street Spirit", all moody and black and dark. Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make you laugh. I mean, it should be sick, too." [...] Magnus Carlsson, Swedish creator of the {{animated}} series Robin, was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as [...] "affectionate" [...] and [...] "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin [...] "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." [...] At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for [...] "No Surprises" [...] and was uncertain as to how to approach [...] "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band [...] "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" [...] because they [...] "didn't want [...] to be too literal." ...|$|E
