25|$|Congestion in schools, {{dilapidated}} and underresourced facilities, {{and a lack}} {{of trained}} teachers. Some pupils have to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 kilometres to school (and the same way back). In 2003 Kakuma Distance Learning Centre offered 29 students the possibility to take academic courses with the University of South Africa.|$|E

She and her husband then <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Chancellery garden, where Goebbels shoots his wife and then himself. As the remaining staff in the bunker evacuate, Krebs and Burgdorf kill themselves. Weidling broadcasts to the city that Hitler is dead and that he will be seeking an immediate ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|The {{large house}} {{situated}} halfway along the dam wall was originally the weirmaster's cottage. The weirmaster would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the hexagonal valve house, constructed {{to the same}} design as BCN tollhouses, and operate the gate valves to release water from Chasewater reservoir into the canal. The construction of the M6 Toll between the reservoir and the A5 required {{the construction of a}} new bridge over the motorway to access the southern side of the lake, where an Innovation Centre provides enhanced access to the waterfront. Selling land for motorway construction also allowed the Chasewater Railway to construct new premises and a large engine shed on the lake side.|$|E

25|$|Amsterdam {{was granted}} city rights in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from {{trade with the}} Hanseatic League. In 1345, an alleged Eucharistic miracle in the Kalverstraat {{rendered}} the city an important place of pilgrimage until {{the adoption of the}} Protestant faith. The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The Stille Omgang—a silent walk or procession in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century. In the heyday of the Silent <b>Walk,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam. In the 21st century this has reduced to about 5000.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunjonmaster program, {{the screen}} is divided into a {{birds-eye}} view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn {{can be used to}} <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervalls regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.|$|E
500|$|Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has {{inspired}} dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and Mad TV. Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled [...] "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood {{why so many people}} would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him on the street and blurt, [...] "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, [...] "what's wrong with these people?" [...] The Walking Dead has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.|$|E

500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E
500|$|Breen stands transfixed and is {{eventually}} {{consumed by the}} energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and {{an image of a}} Martian [...] "devil" [...] floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt, and after Quatermass succumbs to the mass psychosis he attempts to kill Roney, who does not have the alien gene and is therefore immune to the alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, he proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the [...] "devil" [...] but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|Some {{discussion}} in local media has focussed on alleged problems within the community. In 1999, The Australian reported {{that many of}} Cullacabardee's residents were unemployed, had no public transport despite 20 years of State Government management and no access to jobs, shops, education or health services. The article noted that [...] "residents have to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] along a dangerously busy road or through a bush track to reach a shop or bus stop", and that the nearest primary school is [...] away. Nine derelict homes in the community were being refurbished under a training scheme to assist young community members to gain skills, although the community claimed that funding was only available for 12-month periods, making apprenticeships (which run for several years) impossible to offer. A review report into the community in 2000 identified these and other {{issues such as the}} land being zoned General Rural, effectively prohibiting residential development, and the illegal dumping of concrete demolition rubble and other refuse near the community.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} other {{successful}} [...] "drive up" [...] businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including McDonald's (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the window, taking their order [...] "to go". Automation {{and the lack of}} dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the [...] "Speedee Service System". They redesigned their sign specifically {{to make it easier to}} see from the road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure. Businessman Ray Kroc joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Deep Blue Sea {{began on}} August 3, 1998. Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had {{a mind of its own}} sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E
500|$|The first {{additional}} gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait {{known as}} the tölt. This {{is known for its}} explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern {{is the same as the}} walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a [...] "Pig's Pace" [...] or [...] "Piggy-pace" [...] that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a Valhopp and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{what was}} {{initially}} known about the killings, there was a common pattern. In a hit-and-run shooting, the gunman would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his victim, shoot the victim repeatedly at close range, and flee on foot. Another link to the shootings was the killers' preference for a [...]32-caliber pistol, based on the slugs recovered from the victims and the shell casings found at the crime scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{had been}} forced to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50 kilometers. The Latvian guards {{enforced}} their commands by beating the workers with clubs that were four or five feet long. Among other things, Jews were beaten if they smiled upon recognizing another Jewish prisoner. Iwens, an eyewitness, reported that [...] "many women had to cope with their children and aged parents all by themselves, for their men had been killed in the prison massacre." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of the conflict, each night, {{children}} between the ages of 8 and 14, referred to as [...] "night commuters" [...] or [...] "night dwellers" [...] would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] from IDP camps to larger towns, especially Gulu, in search of safety. To avoid abduction by the LRA, every night as many as 40,000 children fled their homes in the countryside to sleep in the relative safety of towns. Known as [...] "night commuters", they seek refuge overnight at churches, hospitals, bus stations and temporary shelters before returning home again each morning.|$|E
