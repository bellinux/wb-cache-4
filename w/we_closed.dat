500|$|Pilot Alexander E. Shvarev recalled: [...] "The Mig {{was perfect}} at altitudes of 4,000 m and above. But at lower altitudes it was, as they say, 'a cow'. That {{was the first}} {{weakness}}. The second was its armament: weapons failure dogged this aircraft. The third weakness was its gunsights, which were inaccurate: that's why <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> {{in as much as}} we could and fired point blank." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Worlds Apart" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted {{that with the}} closing of the bridge, [...] "Fringe effectively pulled the plug on the creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't think we can understate the passing of the parallel world premise." [...] While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series [...] "got the emotions [...] just right." [...] He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, [...] "I was so sad. [...] I had tears in my eyes when <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> the door". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she [...] "was so wrong".|$|E

500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time is what made the show work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keselowski {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 102,000 people who attended the race. Keselowski also earned $186,770 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking I could run outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you could never get a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I could never get around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so that {{was the right thing to}} do, to start on the top and leave me on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking up to the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier. So we all marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E

2500|$|Response to {{the series}} finale, [...] "When Men and Mountains Meet," [...] was passionate among top publications. Jace Lacob of the Daily Beast called it the [...] "perfect way to close out this series" [...] and {{described}} his reaction to it as [...] "emotional". James Poniewozik wrote for Time Magazine that [...] "In the end ... Big Love came back full circle to the core relationships ... <b>We</b> <b>closed</b> on a moving if messy note for a moving if messy series." [...] Mary McNamara, of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it [...] "a perfect finish to an astonishingly ambitious show that often careened through genre, narrative structure and believability like they were false walls on a stage". In her rumination on the finale, Ginia Bellafante of the New York Times noted that [...] " [...] was always at its most compelling as an indictment of the mindless spiritual avidity and the bizarre displays of self-exoneration that can {{go on in the}} name of faith," [...] and celebrated the finale for committing to that theme. She also wrote that the series had [...] "achieved the resonance of [...] other heralded series." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Dr. Ryan Vaughn was less enthusiastic about the finale but said, [...] "I'm not going to let a great series be sullied with a mediocre finale." [...] Finally, The A.V. Club awarded the series finale, and the series as a whole, a B+, writing that its first three seasons in particular qualified as [...] "remarkable television." ...|$|E

60|$|My Lords,--Your Lordships will {{recollect}} that <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> {{the last}} day of your proceeding in this trial at a most interesting part of our charge, or rather of our observations upon that charge. <b>We</b> <b>closed</b> at that awful moment when we found the first women of Oude pillaged of all their landed and of all their moneyed property, in short, of all they possessed. <b>We</b> <b>closed</b> by reciting to you the false pretence on which this pillage was defended, namely, that it was the work of the Nabob. Now we had before proved to you, from evidence adduced by the prisoner himself, that this Nabob was a mere tool in his hands; and therefore, if this pretence be true, it aggravates his guilt: for surely the forcing a son to violate the property of his mother must everywhere be considered a crime most portentous and enormous. At this point we closed; and after the detail which has been given you already of these horrible and iniquitous proceedings, some apology may perhaps be necessary for entering again into the refutation of this iniquitous pretence.|$|E
