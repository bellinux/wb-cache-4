60|$|Merely that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> And Robert Boulger, being a {{youth of}} {{somewhat}} limited intelligence, seemed in the way.|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (sits down). I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> (She {{raises her}} face with a pitiful smile. Nicholls hurriedly moves {{back to his own}} chair.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she said, [...] "it {{was like}} that. I knew you cared. That is why I have so <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> It looked like that...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in {{a canvas}} bag, {{in a hole}} a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, my dear. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|During elimination, Ray <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each girl privately.|$|R
60|$|Here's Charlie. Take him away, there's a dear. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Paradine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again," [...] she said. [...] "I {{am tired of}} all these people. Tell me, Mr. Brand, {{how long will you}} stay on in Theos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{became almost}} barefaced. [...] "It is so true," [...] she said, [...] "that at lunch one can't really talk to anyone. And I've so <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Ever since we met before." ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY. I hate tact. [Newte laughs.] We {{could have}} had such a jolly little lunch together. I'm all alone till the evening. There were ever so many things I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mr. Natural <b>Wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> You!" [...] Mystic Funnies #2 (Last Gasp, Apr. 1999) ...|$|R
50|$|Raven being antisocial, {{including}} not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> and mooning Jessica, Megan, and Brandi C.|$|R
60|$|FRANK [remonstrating piteously] But, my dear Viv, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you ever}} so seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> so much. The {{first time}} I saw you.... At first I dared not.... I {{did not know}} you would let me talk.... And now, just as I am--happy, you are going." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thirlwell {{looked puzzled}} and Allott resumed: [...] "You haven't opened your mail yet and I didn't suggest it, because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> first. I wonder {{whether it will}} be a shock to hear that Sir James is dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad they}} have gone," [...] she said. [...] "You see, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but the dew is commencing to settle and I must go in soon. That is insisted on, though I don't think it matters." ...|$|E
60|$|Not at all. But I have {{no reason}} to believe that Lady Frederick <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{would find}} myself {{thinking}} {{with the utmost}} particularity of her face. Had it changed at all? Was it altogether changed? I seemed to have forgotten everything and remembered everything; that peculiar slight thickness of her eyelids that gave her eyes their tenderness, that light firmness of her lips. Of course she would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, as now I perceived I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
60|$|HARRY. Rather nice of him. [To the AMAH.] Run along, amah, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> missy.|$|R
6000|$|The old soldier laughed {{until his}} merriment startled the clerks in the counting-house. [...] "Be jabers!" [...] he said, In a wheezy voice, [...] "d'ye think I came five miles to do that? No, sir, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about your son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a {{wonderful}} man; {{the amount of}} work he accomplishes without apparent effort is stupendous." [...] Mrs. Constable cast what seemed a tentative glance at the powerful head, and handed him his tea. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about Gertrude," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|You will infallibly suspect me {{of having}} chosen them thus on purpose. No, honor bright!--I chose simply the {{greatest}} men,--those I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about. I arranged {{them by their}} dates; I put them into three conclusive pennons; and behold what follows! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a few words. She {{came to my}} room {{last night}} and {{told me she had}} only a dim {{recollection}} of what took place. She said The Voices <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me--but I didn't <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me--and said so--and she went away." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HOPE. That's enough! I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you seriously! Dick's in love. I'm {{perfectly}} {{certain of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--about some things. I've done {{something}} rather serious to-day. I've made an important decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh {{smiled at}} him. [...] "That's very nice of you, {{and while the}} {{sunshine}} lasts it's pleasant here. I often think an English wood, with the varied colours of the trunks and mosses showing, is most beautiful on a bright winter day. Besides, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> There's a favour I must ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go, I must go," [...] {{went on the}} dreadful, {{familiar}} voice, in a cry of despair. [...] "Oh, {{why were}} you so long opening the door? I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> before you married Annie; and now I shall never see you again--never! never! never! I have lost you for ever! ever! ever!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} found fault with me then for forgetting the past. But let that pass, dear; {{it is not}} OUR affairs I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about now," [...] he said, {{stifling}} a sigh, [...] "it's about your friend. Please don't misunderstand what I am going to say; nor that I interpose except from necessity." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We cannot simply {{expect them}} to say, 'Our older people have had {{experience}} and they have proved to themselves certain things, therefore they are right.' That isn't the way {{the best kind of}} young people think. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience for themselves. I find they are perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people, but they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are not realistic." ...|$|R
50|$|Back on Alpha, Koenig orders Carter {{to return}} to Moonbase and in an {{agitated}} tone tells Kano he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|CANDIDA. Well, then, you are forgiven. Now {{go off to}} bed like a {{good little}} boy: I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> James about you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{keep you}} long," [...] said the foreman, {{glancing at the}} editor's copy with his {{habitual}} half humorous toleration of that work, it being his general conviction that news and advertisements were the only valuable features of a newspaper; [...] "I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> a minute about makin' suthin more o' this yer accident to Colonel Starbottle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm tired," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I don't {{feel like}} dancing just now," [...] {{and led the}} way to the big, rose punch-bowl, one of the Durretts' most {{cherished}} possessions. Glancing up at me over the glass of lemonade I had given her she went on: [...] "Why haven't you been to see me since I came home? I've <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> to hear how you are getting along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor I. I thought I had. Until I saw you again. I've {{thought of}} you endlessly. I've <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We {{had a way of}} talking together. But you went away. You turned your back as though all that was nothing--not worth having. You--you drove home my marriage, Stephen. You made me know what a thing of sex a woman is to a man--and how little else...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the waiter. He likes <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that waiter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you go {{over there}} to Blake and tell him I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. Then you go to Louise's room. I'll follow directly." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Quite seriously. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} a great {{political}} and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact.|$|R
