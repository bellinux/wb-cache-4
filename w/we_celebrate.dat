Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their {{examples}} we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E
500|$|This Homogeneous Reactor Experiment (HRE) was affectionately dubbed [...] "Alvin's 3P reactor" [...] {{because it}} {{required}} a pot, a pipe, and a pump. The HRE went into operation in 1950 and, at the criticality party, Weinberg brought the appropriate spirits: [...] "When piles go critical in Chicago, <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> with wine. When piles go critical in Tennessee, <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> with Jack Daniel's." [...] The HRE operated for 105 days {{before it was}} closed down. Despite its leaks and corrosion, valuable information was gained from its operation and it proved a simple and safe reactor to control. During the time the HRE was online, Senators John F. Kennedy and Albert Gore, Sr. visited ORNL and were hosted by Weinberg.|$|E

The chorale is shared by the voices, with the soprano singing it in Eminor, the tenor in Bminor.

It may be the first time that Bach used these rhythms.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 2010, the fortieth {{anniversary of}} Orr scoring the game-winning goal against the St. Louis Blues in {{overtime}} to clinch the 1970 Stanley Cup, the Bruins commemorated the event with a bronze statue of Orr outside the TD Garden, the Bruins' home rink. The statue depicts Orr sprawled in mid-flight after scoring the goal. The unveiling {{was attended by}} many of Orr's past teammates. Orr spoke at the unveiling: [...] "This specific moment and time <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> with this statue is something we can all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time we enter Boston Garden. To all of you, {{thank you very much}} {{from the bottom of my}} heart. I'm honoured. Guys, thank you." [...] In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} July 1995 in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan, Washington D.C., an RV community in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico. The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park, New Jersey {{before moving to}} the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences. The production then moved to Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada, where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley, and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors. It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add [...] "Today, <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> our Independence Day!" [...] {{to the end of the}} speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed [...] "ID4" [...] because Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title Independence Day, and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in dailies, the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title. The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.|$|E

500|$|Mac Sledge finds {{redemption}} {{largely through}} his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This {{is in keeping}} with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told The New York Times that she [...] "kept me goin'. She never lost faith, and that's a rare thing. I don't know now how we got through it, but we got through it." [...] The lyrics of [...] "If You'll Hold the Ladder", which Mac performs with his new country band {{in the second half of}} the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa's love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott's songs, such as those of [...] "The Best Bedroom in Town": [...] "The best part of all / the room at the end of the hall / That's where you and me make everything alright ... <b>We</b> <b>celebrate</b> the happiness we've found / Every night in the best bedroom in town". His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me". In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman's role in domestic life—although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that Tender Mercies embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.|$|E

"Now Judas {{celebrated the}} festival of the {{restoration}} of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of {{the restoration of}} their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies." ...|$|E
