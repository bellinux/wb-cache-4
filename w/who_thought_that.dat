5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings {{that it was too}} dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|The lament {{was saved}} from {{oblivion}} by Monteverdi's decision {{to publish it}} independently from the opera: first in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal, then in 1623 as a monody, and finally in 1641 as a sacred hymn, Lamento della Madonna. The five-voice adaptation {{was included in the}} composer's Sixth Book of Madrigals; there is evidence that this arrangement was made at the suggestion of an unnamed Venetian gentleman <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the melody would benefit from counterpoint. In 1868 the lament was published in Paris, and in 1910 the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi issued an edited, orchestral transcription.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} {{strongly}} opposed by Thomas Wilfred Sharp, an urban planner from Durham, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the station would intrude on the city's skyline. They were also opposed by The City of Durham Preservation Society (now the City of Durham Trust) {{which had been}} founded two years earlier. At the time the station {{had been given the}} go ahead by Durham City Council and the planning authority, but the Trust believed the station's tall chimneys and cooling towers would dwarf the nearby Durham Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered by people <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> animation {{was only for}} children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Monroe would be happier {{living in a}} family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E
5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly in human life, had been worth fighting. Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the pageantry was designed to distract from the poor living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E
