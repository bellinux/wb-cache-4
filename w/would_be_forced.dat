5|$|If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, the {{electron}} lone pairs on the carbenic carbon <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> into close proximity. Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a}} significant destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise.|$|E
5|$|On a {{practical}} {{level for the}} music professional, the speaker is analytic and clinical-sounding. Gizmodo likened the NS-10 to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings, so that engineers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them.|$|E
50|$|Transfers {{work well}} {{following}} other notrump bids. A common usage follows an opening bid of 2NT where a weak take-out into three {{of a major}} becomes a possibility whereas with traditional methods such a bid <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forcing.</b>|$|R

"By {{fostering}} {{better life}} decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence. Yet opponents {{make it sound}} as if the government <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forcing</b> people into unhappy unions. It's nonsense." ...|$|R
50|$|On 11 May 2013 it was announced, that Andreolli {{would move}} back to Inter on a free transfer. He was also {{eligible}} {{to one of the}} four club-trained players in the squad for UEFA competitions, otherwise Inter <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> to vacant the quota and the squad <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reduced as a consequence.|$|R
5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one. Because both the Gator Bowl and ACC Championship game {{were held in}} Jacksonville, Georgia Tech <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to play two games in Jacksonville in four weeks. The team, league, and bowl officials were concerned that fact would hurt attendance.|$|E
5|$|While Betances was {{studying}} medicine in France, {{his father died}} (in August 1854) and his sister Ana María <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> {{to take over the}} Hacienda Carmen's management. By 1857 the heirs were forced to give the operation's output to a holding company headed by Guillermo Schröeder.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Royal Rumble, Flair faced Perfect in a loser leaves town match, {{in which the}} loser <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to leave the WWF forever. Because Flair had an {{agreement}} with McMahon to lose to Mr. Perfect before leaving the promotion, Perfect won the match and Flair did {{not appear in the}} WWF again until 2001. With Flair gone from the promotion, Luger continued Heenan's feud and defeated Mr. Perfect at WrestleMania IX.|$|E

5000|$|... a {{subsequent}} jump to 4 of the agreed major by doubler <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>forcing,</b> because a raise by doubler {{from two to}} three spades <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> passed by South.|$|R
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} Booker T's {{defense of the}} TNA Legends Championship against Christian Cage, with the added {{stipulation}} that if Cage lost, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to join The Main Event Mafia. Booker T was accompanied by Sharmell for the bout. The match lasted for 11 minutes, ending when Booker T pinned Cage with a roll-up.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to stop.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to stop, although this situation did not occur.|$|E

50|$|The treaty {{contained}} a clause that stated it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in <b>force</b> for 12 years after ratification by both parties; the treaty therefore expired in 1837.|$|R
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose {{of it in the}} ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of Forces Command, in 2009, and {{the implementation of the}} [...] "Adaptive Army" [...] initiative it was decided that no combat units <b>would</b> <b>be</b> directly assigned to the 1st Division on a permanent basis. Instead, it was decided that all combat <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> assigned to <b>Forces</b> Command and the Headquarters 1st Division would provide a command and control function for [...] "high-level training activities", during which activities combat units <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> assigned to the division. It was also tasked with commanding [...] "large scale ground operations" [...] and, at the behest of Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC), the divisional headquarters was tasked with forming the [...] "Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (DJFHQ)", responsible for commanding all deployed forces including those of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force.|$|R

5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate {{the impact of the}} total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> {{into the narrow}} Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening {{the way for a}} drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin.|$|E

5000|$|In some {{positions}} if {{a simple}} bid {{of the suit}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forcing</b> then a single jump can be a splinter. For example, in a system where 1 - 2; 2 <b>is</b> a <b>forcing</b> sequence, 1 - 2; 3 {{may be used as}} a splinter. (However, this approach would require a specific agreement in advance - many players use this sequence to denote a strong two-suiter.) Some partnerships use certain single jumps as [...] "mini-splinters" [...] that promise less strength, allowing partner to choose between part-score and game rather than between game and slam.|$|R
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} Estonia as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from Estonia and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on their own terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} subsequently {{retreated to}} Chonan, where, {{the next night}} the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin {{as well as two}} thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major defensible city left before the Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} deterrence. Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5000|$|According to British {{explorer}} (and abolitionist) Samuel Baker, {{who visited}} Khartoum in 1862 six {{decades after the}} British had declared slave trade illegal, slave trade was the industry [...] "that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town". From Khartoum slave raiders attacked African villages to the south, looting and destroying so that [...] "surviving inhabitants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> to collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages," [...] and taking back captured women and young adults to sell in slave markets.|$|R
25|$|In October 1994, the Niki Museum, {{dedicated}} to {{telling the story}} of her life and artwork, was opened in Nasu, Japan. However, the Niki Museum <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to close in 2011.|$|R
25|$|In September 1939, {{despite the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, he welcomed the British {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany. When {{this turned out to}} be contrary to the Comintern line (as Rajani Palme Dutt, who succeeded him as General Secretary, had warned him it <b>would</b> <b>be),</b> he <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to resign. He was reinstated after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|R
