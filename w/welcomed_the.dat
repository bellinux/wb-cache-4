Critics compared Angie to Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), a character whose lagging storyline was slow in developing during the series' second season.|$|E

5|$|During {{his reign}} the Byzantine navy briefly won back Alexandria in 645, but lost {{it again in}} 646 shortly after the Battle of Nikiou. The Islamic forces raided Sicily in 652, while Cyprus and Crete were {{captured}} in 653. According to Arab historians, the local Christian Copts <b>welcomed</b> <b>the</b> Arabs just as the Monophysites did in Jerusalem. The loss of this lucrative province deprived the Byzantines of their valuable wheat supply, thereby causing food shortages throughout the Byzantine Empire and weakening its armies in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted {{criticism from the}} Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the signs were placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas.

Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings about the danger posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.|$|E

5|$|Richard made overtures to Landais, {{offering}} {{military support}} for Landais's weak regime under Duke Francis II of Brittany {{in exchange for}} Henry. Henry fled to Paris, where he secured support from the French regent Anne of Beaujeu, who supplied troops for an invasion in 1485. The French government, recalling Richard's effective disowning of the Treaty of Picquigny and refusal to accept the accompanying French pension, would not have <b>welcomed</b> <b>the</b> accession of one known to be unfriendly to France.|$|E
5|$|The Cambodian {{government}} was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however <b>welcomed</b> <b>the</b> intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership had hoped for permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. It has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{new road}} also led {{indirectly}} to {{the downfall of}} the area's public transportation system.

Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce <b>welcomed</b> <b>the</b> service at the time, proudly citing the city's progressive citizenship. The area's low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line went out of business and immediately halted service.|$|E
