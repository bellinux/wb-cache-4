5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E

Barrowman publicly supported Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, {{and was one of}} 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.|$|E
5|$|McNary was the Republican {{vice presidential}} {{candidate}} in 1940, on the ticket with presidential candidate Wendell Willkie; both died in 1944, during {{what would have been}} their first term had they won. They lost to the Democratic ticket, composed of Franklin D. Roosevelt, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for his third term as president, and Henry A. Wallace in a landslide. McNary was a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1913 to 1915 and was dean of Willamette University College of Law, in his hometown of Salem, from 1908 to 1913. Before that, he was a deputy district attorney under his brother, John Hugh McNary, who later became a federal judge for the District of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E

As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Daniels had {{his first}} {{experience}} in politics while still a teenager when, in 1968, {{he worked on the}} unsuccessful campaign of fellow Hoosier and Princeton alumnus William Ruckelshaus, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh. After the campaign Ruckelshaus helped Daniels secure an internship in the office of then-Indianapolis mayor Richard Lugar. Daniels worked on Lugar's re-election campaign in 1971, and later, in 1974, he worked on Lugar's first campaign for Senate via L. Keith Bulen's Campaign Communicators, Inc, a political consultancy where Daniels served as vice president. Daniels joined Lugar's mayoral staff in December, 1974. Within three years, he became Lugar's principal assistant. After Lugar was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Daniels followed him to Washington, D.C. as his Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull clear {{from the rest of}} the field and set {{consecutive}} fastest laps. Barrichello began to hold up the McLaren drivers to allow his teammate to extend his lead. Further down the field, Trulli passed Ralf Schumacher to take seventh position on lap two. Heidfeld was overtaken by Alesi for 14th on the same lap. On the following lap, Ralf Schumacher retook seventh position from Trulli. Heidfeld lost a further position to Fisichella on lap four. Ralf Schumacher started to challenge Frentzen for sixth position on the fifth lap. At the front of the pack, Michael Schumacher was in control, extending his lead over Barrichello to five seconds by lap ten. Button took tenth position from Irvine on lap twelve, while Heidfeld collided with Alesi, sending his teammate into a spin who rejoined in 18th. Button moved into ninth place when he passed Salo on lap 13. Zonta, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> 17th, suffered brake problems on lap 17 and collided with the tyre barriers which caused him to retire from the Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|The Dirty War {{eventually}} ended, and the National Reorganization Process allowed {{political activity}} {{in preparation for}} a return to democracy. Kirchner led one of the three internal factions of the local Justicialist Party (PJ), but Peronist Arturo Puricelli prevailed in the primary elections. Kirchner founded the Ateneo Juan Domingo Perón organization, which supported deposed president Isabel Perón and promoted political dialogue with the military. Cristina Fernández became an attorney of the PJ in Santa Cruz, with the help of Rafael Flores, a former friend from the FURN. Raúl Alfonsín, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for president for the Radical Civic Union (UCR), denounced an agreement between the military and the Peronist unions which sought an amnesty for the military. Kirchner organized a rally on behalf of Rodolfo Ponce, a union leader mentioned by Alfonsín in his denouncement. Alfonsín won the 1983 presidential election, and Puricelli was elected governor of Santa Cruz. Puricelli sought to unify the local Peronist movement by adding members of the other factions into his government, and appointed Kirchner president of the provincial social-welfare fund.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{conditions}} became more breezy but remained {{hot in the}} Saturday morning practice sessions. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session {{with a time of}} 1:19.115. Barrichello was second quickest, recording a lap time 0.089 seconds slower than Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher was third fastest, two-tenths of a second in front of Trulli, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve. Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert completed the top ten. Coulthard did not set a lap during the third session as his team changed his engine as it developed an electrical problem. In the final practice session, Coulthard had a trouble-free session and was fastest with a time of 1:18.654. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday and were second and third fastest. Häkkinen was fourth quickest and was unable to improve his time as he passed an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> quicker after set-up changes. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} surrounding Roy Oswalt's nomination because {{he only had}} a 7–5 record {{at the time of}} nominations making him the only pitcher without eight wins nominated. However, he is {{considered by many to be}} the victim of lack of run support, questionable relief pitching and an average defense. This respect was shown by the players who had voted him to sixth place among National League starting pitchers making him the first alternate in case of injury to any of the five elected All-star starting pitchers. On the final day of All-Star Final Vote voting, it was announced that Oswalt (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> third in the All-Star Final Vote) would replace John Smoltz who withdrew from All-Star game participation due to injury.|$|E

5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
