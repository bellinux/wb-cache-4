25|$|Many {{accessories}} {{have been}} made for the iPod line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as the iPod Hi-Fi, are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike+iPod pedometer and the iPod Camera Connector. Other notable accessories include external speakers, <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones. Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, several radio {{manufacturers}} offered remote controls {{for some of}} their higher-end models. Most of these were connected to the set being controlled by wires, but the Philco Mystery Control (1939) was a battery-operated low-frequency radio transmitter, thus making it the first <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control for a consumer electronics device. [...] Using pulse-count modulation, this also was the first digital <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control.|$|E
2500|$|The first remote {{intended}} {{to control a}} television was developed by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1950. The remote, called [...] "Lazy Bones", {{was connected to the}} television by a wire. A <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control, the [...] "Flashmatic", was developed in 1955 by Eugene Polley. It worked by shining a beam of light onto a photoelectric cell, but the cell did not distinguish between light from the remote and light from other sources. The Flashmatic also had to be pointed very precisely at the receiver in order to work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Robert Adler {{developed}} [...] "Zenith Space Command", a <b>wireless</b> <b>remote.</b> It was {{mechanical and}} used ultrasound {{to change the}} channel and volume. When the user pushed {{a button on the}} remote control, it clicked and struck a bar, hence the term [...] "clicker". Each bar emitted a different frequency and circuits in the television detected this sound. The invention of the transistor made possible cheaper electronic remotes that contained a piezoelectric crystal that was fed by an oscillating electric current at a frequency near or above the upper threshold of human hearing, though still audible to dogs. The receiver contained a microphone attached to a circuit that was tuned to the same frequency. Some problems with this method were that the receiver could be triggered accidentally by naturally occurring noises, and some people could hear the piercing ultrasonic signals.|$|E

50|$|After {{seeing a}} {{need in the}} Hydroflight Sports {{community}} for a <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control throttle, Merrell teamed up with (title) Jeff Elkins to create one. In August 2014 they designed and began manufacturing their beta version of their <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control throttle, aptly named “The F4 Flight Controller”. After witnessing issues with other products that would lose signal, dropping Hydrofliers out of the air, {{they went back to}} the drawing board with Flytronics wireless to incorporate a new code ensuring that Hydrofliers from that point forward would not experience the same with Flytronics product. They incorporated the first “Flytronics-safe-fall” technology into their <b>wireless</b> <b>remote</b> control throttle, which enables the Hydroflier to be lowered into the water, much like an elevator ride, if signal should be lost.|$|E
