5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show {{the back of his}} neck to confirm that Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{finally reached}} Uraga at the {{entrance}} to Edo Bay in Japan on July 8, 1853. His actions at this crucial juncture were informed by a careful study of Japan's previous contacts with Western ships and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about the Japanese hierarchical culture. As he arrived, Perry ordered his ships to steam past Japanese lines towards the capital of Edo, and turn their guns towards the town of Uraga. Perry refused Japanese demands to leave, or to proceed to Nagasaki, the only Japanese port open to foreigners.|$|E

25|$|On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee during his {{nomination}} to replace J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, the committee chairman, Sam Ervin, questioned Gray as to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about the White House obtaining the files. Gray stated he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence entrusted to him by Dean. Gray's nomination failed and now Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 17 years, Gandalf {{travelled}} extensively, searching for answers on the Ring. He found some answers in Isildur's scroll, {{in the archives}} of Minas Tirith. But he also wanted to interview Gollum, who had borne the Ring for many years. Gandalf searched long and widely for Gollum, and often had the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeded, and Gandalf questioned Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proved unwilling to speak. Gandalf learned finally that Sauron had forced Gollum under torture in Barad-dûr to tell <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> of the Ring. This reinforced Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post-war}} period, Pope Benedict XV was {{involved}} in developing the Church administration {{to deal with the}} new international system that had emerged. The papacy was faced with the emergence of numerous new states such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Finland, and others. Germany, France, Italy and Austria were impoverished from the war. In addition, the traditional social and cultural European order was threatened by right-wing nationalism and fascism as well as left-wing socialism and communism, all of which potentially threatened the existence and freedom of the Church. To deal with these and related issues, Benedict engaged in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> best, a large scale diplomatic offensive to secure the rights of the faithful in all countries.|$|E

A previously redacted November 25 text message from Wildstein to Baroni said that O'Toole was ready with a statement, which was issued to the media, that echoed talking points from Baroni's same day presentation and attacked the Democrats investigating these issues. O'Toole followed up with an editorial in The Record that elaborated on these talking points and attacks. It raised further questions on whether O'Toole should continue to serve on the committee.|$|E
25|$|A Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll, {{published}} February 24, 2014, showed Christie's {{job approval}} ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior.

A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to be about the same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke. It reported that 62% said that Bridgegate and Hoboken's Sandy relief aid issues hurt his presidential prospects for 2016, up from 51% in January.|$|E
25|$|Penn {{was born}} in Hawaii to Jay Dee Penn, an Irish-American, and Loraine Shin, a Korean-American. At the age of 17, Penn began {{training}} in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being introduced to it by his neighbor, Tom Callos. Callos had put up fliers in local gyms looking for people to train with, and B.J.'s father Jay Dee Penn had called Callos and said his boys were interested. Callos then taught B.J. and his brother <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> Shortly thereafter, B.J. moved to San Jose, California to begin training at the Ralph Gracie BJJ academy with Dave Camarillo, who he lived with and became close friends with. It was here during his time in San Jose {{that he decided to}} pursue a career in martial arts (albeit not mixed martial arts at the time).|$|E

25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E
25|$|Olivia is a 29-year-old FBI Special Agent {{assigned}} to a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, after her partner and lover, John Scott, is exposed to a flesh-dissolving agent. Both Agent Broyles and Nina Sharp consider her to have much potential and talent, the latter even hoping to bring her on as an employee of Massive Dynamic. An experiment by Dr. Bishop to link her to the dying John Scott's mind {{in order to learn}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of his consciousness, causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness. This results in Olivia mistaking John Scott's memories for her own. With help from Walter, Olivia finds a way to communicate with John within her own mind, eventually allowing the memories to fade completely.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E
