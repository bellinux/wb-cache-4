25|$|Okada {{is known}} for being reserved. He does not meet with many people within the agency. In an {{interview}} on Shōnen Club Premium, Okada {{said that when he}} was little, whenever his name was called up to read something in class, he <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> vomiting and purposely avoided school on those days. Within V6, he is also the most quiet person. He enjoys carpentry and has carved wooden bears for children.|$|E
500|$|Wealth {{and goods}} became game rewards {{during the last}} decades of the 19th century with the winner of McLoughlin Brothers' The Game of Playing Department Store, for instance, being [...] the player who {{carefully}} spent his money accumulating the most goods in a department store. Bulls and Bears: The Great Wall St. Game promised players they <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] "speculators, bankers, and brokers", and the 1885 catalog advertisement for McLoughlin Brothers Monopolist informed the interested, [...] "On this board the great struggle between Capital and Labor can be fought out {{to the satisfaction of}} all parties, and, if the players are successful, they can break the Monopolist and become Monopolists themselves".|$|E

50|$|In February 2006, Roark Gourley {{worked with}} The Edinburg Children's Hospital {{to create a}} light-hearted {{environment}} for children suffering from terminal illnesses. He worked with the hospital to create a jungle themed environment that <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> a play room than a hospital.|$|R
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} and produced {{in one day}} at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager at the time. The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, [...] "the idea was, it <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> one-on-one with whoever the woman was." [...] D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating [...] "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1962, cabana motel owners Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin {{applied for}} a $10.6 million loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. He began {{plans to build a}} hotel on land owned by Kirk Kerkorian. Sarno would later act as {{designer}} of the hotel he planned to construct. His vision was to emulate life under the Roman Empire. The objective of the palace was to ensure an atmosphere in which everybody staying at the hotel <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a Caesar. Caesars Palace was instrumental in beginning a new era of lavish casinos from the late 1960s onward. Architectural writer, Alan Hess, stated: [...] "Caesars Palace needed only a sumptuous array of Classical statuary and a host of marble-white columns to establish its theme. The visitor's imagination, in league with well-placed publicity, filled in the opulence". Jefferson Graham wrote that the result was [...] "the gaudiest, weirdest, most elaborate, and most talked about resort Vegas had ever seen. [...] emblem was a chesty female dipping grapes into the waiting mouth of a recumbent Roman, fitted out in toga, laurel wreath, and phallic dagger".|$|E
500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, {{using a combination of}} model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." [...] He continued that [...] "it had to be huge, so that the audience <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real." [...] The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the [...] "Time Displacement Device" [...] in [...] in a scene that did not make the final cut.|$|E

6000|$|... "Allonby, of the Dayspring!" [...] said Devine. [...] "Now, {{the last}} time we worried about the thing you told me you {{considered}} our chances good enough to put your savings in. <b>Would</b> you <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> doing it to-day? I want the information, not the dollars. You know it's generally wisest to be straight with me." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} hospital's design of a cottage system was Doctor Joseph Workman who wanted a hospital that <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an institution. The architect for the site was Kivas Tully, who worked with gardener Samuel Matheson, designed the original facility {{under the supervision of}} the Superintendent of the Queen Street Asylum, Dr. Daniel K. Clark.|$|R
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with {{a pretty good idea of}} what it <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like.</b> And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
500|$|Rockstar found a {{match in}} the Red Dead Redemption {{universe}} for their long-standing aim {{to create a}} zombie game. In lieu of making a new intellectual property for such a game, Rockstar instead wanted players to see how a zombie outbreak affected a world already familiar to them. The company thought that this would make the zombie trope more interesting. Rockstar also saw similar [...] "cinematic heritage" [...] between the Western and zombie horror genres. The team used the analogy of a 1970s film set to explain their ambitions—that Undead Nightmare in the Red Dead Redemption universe <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> its characters filming a [...] "serious, revisionist Western" [...] by day and a [...] "somewhat insane horror movie" [...] with the same cast and set by night. Following its experience with Grand Theft Auto IV downloadable content packs, Rockstar wanted its add-on packs to be a separate story with possible overlaps rather than {{a continuation of the}} main story. Rockstar vice president of creative Dan Houser described several reasons for not using the Grand Theft Auto universe for the zombie release: (1) that Red Dead shooting mechanics, including its slow-motion Dead Eye feature, were a better fit for zombie headshots, (2) that zombies were a better fit for the Great Plains landscape, more reminiscent of a 1970s horror film, and (3) that John Marston was a better fit for hunting zombies than the protagonists of Grand Theft Auto games.|$|E
50|$|After garnering {{positive}} word-of-mouth {{and promising}} reviews and radio play for her earliest releases, So Black, So Bright (2002) and Extended Play (2004), Kim {{began work on}} what <b>would</b> become I <b>Feel</b> <b>Like</b> a Fading Light (2006).|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am not unhappy," [...] she answered. [...] "You {{and aunt}} have been {{both of you}} most generous and kind to me. But I do feel that a busy life--and I'm not a bit domestic, you know {{would be good for}} me. I believe, uncle, if you were in my place you <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>like</b> me.

2500|$|Buffett {{has written}} several times of his belief that, {{in a market}} economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents. His {{children}} will not inherit {{a significant proportion of}} his wealth.

2500|$|In August 2010, Raytheon {{announced}} that it had partnered with a jail in Castaic, California to use prisoners as test subjects for the new non-lethal Silent Guardian active denial system that [...] " [...] penetrates about a 64th of an inch under your skin.

2500|$|The {{anonymous}} {{figure to}} whom Arnold addresses his poem becomes {{the subject of}} Hecht's poem. In Hecht's poem she [...] "caught the bitter allusion to the sea", imagined [...] "what his whiskers <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> / On {{the back of her}} neck", and felt sad as she looked out across the channel. [...] "And then she got really angry" [...] at the thought that she had become [...] "a sort of mournful cosmic last resort". After which she says [...] "one or two unprintable things".|$|E
5000|$|The song's title {{refers to}} the digital editing {{software}} Adobe Photoshop and how it has been utilized in the cosmetics industry to alter people's images as a marketing ploy for their products. According to frontman Jonathan Higgs, [...] "Photoshop Handsome looks at the world of digital image manipulation and computer game re-incarnation. What <b>would</b> it <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{to come back to}} life as one of the 'perfected', false, immortal beings that adorn magazine covers, adverts and games?".|$|R
60|$|But the Jews did {{die with}} Jerusalem. That {{is the first}} and last great truth in Zionism. Jerusalem was {{destroyed}} and Jews were destroyed with it, men who cared no longer to live because the city of their faith had fallen. It may be questioned whether all the Zionists have all the sublime insanity of the Zealots. But at least it is not nonsense to suggest that the Zionists might <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> this about Zion. It is nonsense to suggest that they <b>would</b> ever <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> this about Dublin or Moscow. And so far at least the truth both in Semitism and Anti-Semitism is included in Zionism.|$|R
60|$|As for Margery, no {{determination}} {{was needed}} in her case. Everything {{was better than}} she had expected to find it. The cabin, with the bark on almost everything, even the furniture, was just what {{a house in the}} woods ought to be; and when she entered the little studio, which was nearer allied to the original forest than any other part of the house, she declared that that must be her room, and that living there she <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> almost <b>like</b> a dryad in an oak.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Rozelle, [...] "The sensation of what something feels like {{is used to}} describe everything from sensual pleasure to pain and torture. [...] It's a wide range, and your readers have actually experienced only some of those feelings. [...] So {{your job is to}} either make them recall exactly what it feels like when something occurs in your story or, if they haven't experienced it, what it <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> if they did" [...] [...] Morrell describes a [...] "sensory surround", which when [...] "coupled with drama tugs the reader into [...] story and forces him to keep reading." ...|$|E
2500|$|Learning of {{the unrest}} over the robbery, Smith {{took to the}} streets, {{mingling}} with the residents and merchants, and claiming {{that no one had}} been robbed. Smith argued that Stewart had lost his gold in a square game. Between 2 and 6 PM, “at least a dozen men went to Soapy Smith and {{tried to get him to}} disavow the robbery and give up the men.” Smith, however, maintained his position and “declined to do anything about the matter,” finally stating in exasperation “that if Stewart had not ‘hollered,’ he [...] <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> going out and getting him a piece of the money” back. In contrast with the Alaskan, Smith told several businessmen he would make amends.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} {{prior to the}} actual test, the [...] "teacher" [...] was given a sample {{electric}} shock from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the [...] "learner" [...] would supposedly receive during the experiment <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like.</b> The [...] "teacher" [...] was then given a list of word pairs {{that he was to}} teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-volt increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the teacher would read the next word pair.|$|E

We <b>would</b> all <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> rejoicing if the victories were on the western front. 'When will the British strike?' Gertrude sighed this morning.

'Which is true,' said he, 'because I have to do it so much.' 'You will excuse me, sir, for saying so,' said I, 'but if you did things for {{pleasure}} sometimes, your mind would be rested, and you <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> comprehending the deliciousness of some of my special dishes, which I notice you now and again say nothing about, because you are so hungry when you eat them, you don't notice their savoriness.'" ...|$|R
5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> writing, she <b>would</b> {{interview}} {{people who}} worked for the production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|R
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we were more in a band".|$|E

5000|$|Lappen put {{a plaque}} in English and German to mark Mann's {{residency}} at the house. Chester Lappen died in 2010, {{and the house}} remained in his family, yet a possible sale was not considered as late as 2012. Critic Alex Ross, writing in The New Yorker, felt that [...] "Perhaps the juggernaut of the real-estate market is destined to roll over the Mann house as it has over many other notable places. Worse things will {{have happened in the}} world. But for anyone who loves Mann's work, or who cherishes the story of émigré culture in Los Angeles, it would be a crushing outcome...but the levelling of 1550 San Remo <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> almost <b>like</b> the obliteration of an era".|$|R
2500|$|But {{contrary}} to the opposition's hopes the construction of Winfield continued unabated, {{and in fact the}} establishment of Winfield Township resulted in the unforeseen positive effect of permitting the projects residents to control their own future and the eventual destiny of their community. Winfield's new residents <b>would</b> at first <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> second-class citizens, surrounded by hostile enemies.
