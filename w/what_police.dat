For 2006, Metro Vancouver had {{the highest rate of}} gun-related violent crime of any major metropolitan region in Canada, with 45.3 violent offences involving guns for every 100,000 people in Metro Vancouver, above the national average of 27.5.

During a hearing on the motion, the district attorney filed a more specific accounting of what investigative work had been done, allowing the media to report {{for the first time on}} <b>what</b> <b>police</b> had searched in the immediate aftermath of the crime. [...] "Eighteen months goes by and no one's been charged and no one's been arrested" [...] said a lawyer for the Tar Heel.

[...] In response the district attorney's office argued that releasing the detailed records at that point would definitely hinder the investigation, and the records remained under seal.|$|E
2500|$|Curry {{began to}} use the term 'Red Hand Defenders' in late 1996 as a means of {{allowing}} loyalists officially on ceasefire to continue their activity. Publicly however, Curry consistently denied any involvement in the RHD as well as any links to the LVF, claims that were regularly published in the press. Curry soon fell in with a group of dissidents within the West Belfast UDA and constructed a number of car bombs for them, including one that detonated under the car of Eddie Copeland on 22 December 1996, seriously injuring the Provisional IRA leader. A further car bomb Curry made for the UDA was used to kill Glen Greer on 25 October 1997 outside his Bangor home. Greer, who had been a UDA member in the Kilcooley estate, had long been under threat due to allegations that he had worked as an informer for the RUC Special Branch. McDonald and Cusack have also claimed that Curry shot and killed William [...] "Wassy" [...] Paul, a former UVF member, on 3 July 1998 in <b>what</b> <b>police</b> believed {{to be part of a}} feud over drugs. The two had a long-running personal enmity and Curry would confess to being the murderer shortly before his own death the following year.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Ginsburg, {{joined by}} Justice Souter, {{focused on the}} long-standing {{connection}} in the Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence between a traffic stop and the stop-and-frisk authorized in Terry v. Ohio (1968). The scope of a Terry stop is not circumscribed merely by duration; {{the manner in which}} the stop is carried out must also be carefully controlled. Ginsburg would have applied this principle to the traffic stop in this case, and required reasonable suspicion for the police to transform the routine traffic stop into a more extensive search for drugs. The fact that a dog sniff is sui generis only matters if the sole determinant of what is [...] "reasonable" [...] is the length of time a traffic stop lasts. If the Court had recognized that traffic stops must be limited in <b>what</b> <b>police</b> are searching for as well as how long they take to conduct the search, the sui generis nature of dog sniffs would not have been dispositive of the case. [...] "Under today's decision, every traffic stop could become an occasion to call in the dogs, to the distress and embarrassment of the law-abiding population.... Today's decision clears the way for suspicionless, dog-accompanied drug sweeps of parked cars along sidewalks and in parking lots.... Motorists [...] have constitutional grounds for complaint should police with dogs, stationed at long traffic lights, circle cars waiting for the red signal to turn green." ...|$|E
