500|$|In early 2008, a {{group of}} MKs {{wrote a letter to}} the Prime Minister asking that the tomb be renovated: [...] "The {{tombstone}} is completely shattered, and the holy site is desecrated in an appalling manner, the likes of which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> in Israel or anywhere else in the world." [...] In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb, but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb. In December 2008, Jewish workers funded by anonymous donors painted the blackened walls and re-built the shattered stone marker covering the grave.|$|E
500|$|The Peregrine, by J. A. Baker, {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as [...] "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" [...] and Werner Herzog, who called it [...] "the one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films," [...] and said elsewhere [...] "... it has prose of the calibre that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> since Joseph Conrad." [...] In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.|$|E
500|$|Patrick W. Galbraith of Otaku2.com {{compared}} {{the design of}} OZ to Takashi Murakami's artwork, specifically [...] "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" [...] and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, [...] "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." [...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a way <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E
60|$|Three hours {{passed in}} silence, {{and during that}} time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> even a tuft of {{feathers}} to betoken the whereabouts of an enemy.|$|R
60|$|We lay in {{the cove}} or harbour, where, as I have said, our {{rendezvous}} was appointed, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet been on shore, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the directions our admiral had left for us.|$|R
60|$|And now Santa shook {{from her}} {{shoulder}} something that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> before--a rope lasso. She freed the loop of it, coiling the length {{in her left}} hand, and plunged into {{the thick of the}} cattle.|$|R
2500|$|Public {{reaction}} to the film was monitored by the government: in a memorandum to Mikhail Suslov from 11 March 1950, two officials from the Bolshevik All-Union Communist Party's Propaganda Department reported that the newspaper Art and Life received numerous letters from viewers, who – although generally approving of the film – criticized {{various aspects of the}} plot; many of them cited Ivanov's boyish conduct as unworthy of a Stakhanovite. Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeni Chernonog, a war veteran, watched The Fall of Berlin while intoxicated. He commented: [...] "And where did this angel come from? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> him there". He was arrested and condemned to eight years in the Gulag.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, Srikumar Banerjee, {{without the}} {{implementation}} of fast breeders the presently available uranium reserves of 5.469 million tonnes can support 570 GWe till 2025. If the total identified and undiscovered uranium reserves of 16 million tonnes are brought online, the power availability can be extended {{till the end of}} the century. While calling for more research into thorium as an energy source and the country’s indigenous three-stage programme, he said, [...] "The world always felt there would be a miracle. Unfortunately, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> any miracle for the last 40 years. Unless we wake up, humans won't be able to exist beyond this century." ...|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Smith {{wrote of}} the actions of the Danites largely with disapproval and on more than one occasion. However, in {{speaking}} on dissenting Mormons, Smith wrote in his Scriptory Book that after Sidney Rigdon spoke on the subject of [...] "dissenters," [...] they (according to Smith) [...] "took warning, and Soon they were Seen bounding over the prairie like the Scape Goat to carry of their own Sins <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>Seen</b> them Since, their influence is gone, and they are in a miserable condition. So also it with all who turn from the truth to Lying Cheating defrauding & Swindeling." [...] It has been alleged by some historians that these comments evidenced Smith's approval of the Danites' actions, even though {{there is no mention of}} [...] "Danites" [...] in these statements, and there is only a tenuous circumstantial connection between this incident and the Danites.|$|E

60|$|A moon-faced trooper of German extraction--never was park so {{carefully}} patrolled--came up to inform us that as yet <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> {{any of the}} real geysers; {{that they were all}} a mile or so up the valley, and tastefully scattered round the hotel in which we would rest for the night.|$|R

60|$|We were {{no sooner}} on shore {{but we found}} people in abundance; for there were two or three, small towns within a little way of the shore; and I suppose <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> the more people about us, because, as we {{understood}} afterwards, they had seen us before, though <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> them.|$|R
60|$|We {{went for}} our dinner to the White Hart, the very inn which Shakspeare celebrates in his Merry Wives, {{and had a}} most overflowing, merry time of it.

60|$|My {{mother made}} {{the young man}} welcome, as she would have done any I might have brought in with me to our home in Pennsylvania, and {{out here in the}} wilderness, where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a strange, yet friendly, face since my poor father was murdered, she was rejoiced to meet one who might give us news of the outside world.|$|R

60|$|Since <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{entered the}} {{territory}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a hostile Indian, and <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to ridicule the stories <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{heard of the}} great numbers of these vicious marauders {{that were supposed to}} haunt the trails, taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches.|$|R
5000|$|I {{very well}} {{remember}} {{at the beginning}} of the war being with Picasso on the boulevard Raspail when the first camouflaged truck passed.

60|$|She {{is not so}} heartbroken, after all, you may be saying, and I {{had promised}} to break her heart. But, honestly, I don't {{know how to do}} it more thoroughly, and you must {{remember}} that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> her alone yet.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> a gam one day, on this voyage, with a Yankee whale-ship, and {{a first-rate}} gam it was, for, as the Yankee had gammed {{three days before}} with another English ship, {{we got a lot}} of news second-hand; and, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a new face for many months, we felt towards those Yankees like brothers, and {{swallowed}} all they had to tell us like men starving for news.|$|R

60|$|As {{the evening}} advanced, {{other members of}} the household, whom as yet <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen,</b> began to drop in.

He wore a new straw hat also with three {{distinct}} ribbons tied about the crown; one black, one green, and one pink. Shoes or stockings, however, he had none.|$|R

60|$|The western shore {{was nearly}} as sandy as the eastern, but the water was much smoother, and the bottom was {{partially}} covered with the slender grass-like seaweed (Zostera), which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> on the Atlantic side; there were also a few rude sheds for trying fish on the beach there, which made it appear less wild.
