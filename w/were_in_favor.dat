5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 {{in favor of a}} convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E

5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of imposing this sentence and two men opposed it.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, an {{assembly}} elected Bernardino Rivadavia {{as president of}} the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.|$|E

5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against the racism {{that took place in the}} sport. As a result of protests and communities coming together to support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial of {{daylight}} saving in Queensland, Australia, {{a referendum on}} daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor.</b> In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement. The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks {{were eager}} to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) succeed as King of Greece. He was elected with 95% {{of the vote in}} the Greek head of state {{referendum}} of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government's suggestion. To their and Victoria's reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother). Many <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest's sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg started laying {{plans for}} further {{construction}}, at first looking at {{construction of a}} new grandstand on the east end. In May 1998, Lerkendal Eiendom AS, owned 44% by Rosenborg, was established to build three new grandstands, including removing the running track to make it a football-only stadium. An alternative was to move and build an all-new stadium at Ranheim. Following the announcement of the Ranheim plans, Mayor Anne Kathrine Slungård stated that {{she did not want to}} sell Lerkendal, as she wanted public ownership of cultural infrastructure. In April 1999, Trondheim Municipality's chief of administration, Knut Sæther, recommended that the municipality sell Lerkendal to Rosenborg, who would then along with private investors be free to construct the necessary facilities. At the time, the municipality estimated the value of Lerkendal to between NOK50 and 100 million. The football district stated they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of conversion of Lerkendal, and that they feared that if Rosenborg moved Lerkendal would incur high costs on the municipality, giving Granåsen as an example of a little used skiing facility which used half the municipal funding for sports venues.|$|E
5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt {{for more than a}} year, and who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E

5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
