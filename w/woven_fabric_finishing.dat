40|$|The {{target of}} the current work {{is to examine the}} effects of {{different}} kinds of finishing treatments on the hand properties of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> produced with compact spun yarns. Plain, twill and satin fabrics were produced with 100 % cotton compact yarns in two yarn counts of 20 tex and 12 tex. All the fabrics were divided into two groups and mercerization process was applied to the one of the groups. The mercerized fabrics were dyed and printed with reactive dyestuffs. The other non mercerized groups of fabrics were divided into three such as reactive dyed, reactive printed and pigment printed. As a result, 30 different fabrics were obtained. In order to measure the handle properties of the fabrics objectively, Shirley stiffness tester, circular bending rigidity tester and thickness tester were used. It was determined that yarn count, <b>fabric</b> <b>weave</b> and <b>finishing</b> treatment have a statistically significant effect on handle properties of the <b>fabrics</b> <b>woven</b> with compact spun yarns...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine whether various selected finishing treatments which may be applied to plain and twill <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> used for chefs’ jackets can offer the potential for protection against scald injuries, as well as examining the impact of layering fabrics. Results showed that the Teflon® <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics</b> which offer combined water and stain repellency had the longest time to predicted skin burn injury and lowest absorbed energy compared with all other <b>fabric</b> <b>finishes.</b> Increasing the numbers of layers of the Teflon® <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics</b> has the greatest potential for providing good protection against scald injuries as much of the water in a hot-water splash runs off the repellent fabric surface. None of the Teflon® treated fabric systems reached the predicted third-degree burn criterion, even as a single layered system, whereas, all other fabric/finishes met the third-degree burn criterion as a single and sometimes double-layered system. Conflicting results were evident for the soil-release finish, which lowered the protective performance in twill <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics,</b> but increased protection in the plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> (compared to regular <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics).</b> With the exception of soil-release finishes, the heavier weight twill <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> offered longer times to predicted second-degree burn and lower absorbed energy, than the lighter weight plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, the addition of another layer to the fabric system tended to increase the potential protective performance of the fabric systems for most <b>fabric</b> <b>finishes,</b> although decreasing the air permeability. There is clear evidence in this research of the benefit of applying a Teflon® finish to chef’s clothing, not only to improve repellency against oil and water-borne stains, but also as a means to improve protection against hot water splash. The Teflon® finish maintains a level of thermal comfort which is currently accepted in chef’s clothing. Further work to determine whether Teflon® would also increase protection against hot oils and steam is recommended, as well as the durability of the treatment to repeated laundering.|$|R

The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s. This indicated that the ballistic projectile was impacting on 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> (followed by another 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric)</b> at a time instead of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> based on {{the arrangement of the}} sandwich panel. The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed. One possible reason behind the improved ballistic test is that the areal density of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> is the highest when the layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> are assembled together. Therefore, it is crucial to have ballistic projectile entrapped within the Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layers before prioritising the arrangement of sandwich panel...|$|R
30|$|When each {{individual}} treatment group was considered, {{there was an}} interesting finding on the soil release group. The plain <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the twill <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The plain <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the twill <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between <b>fabric</b> type and <b>finish</b> was due to the presence of the soil release finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The soil release <b>finish</b> <b>fabric</b> was the exception to this trend. Soil release finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the twill <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove soil from the fabric (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the twill <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> are heavier and thicker than the plain <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the twill fabrics store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|R

The structure of the terry fabric is characterized by its complex weave which is obtained through interlacing two systems of warp and one system of weft. The loop pile is one of the most important elements of the terry <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> structure because the appearance of the product and many other properties depend on the loops formed on the surface of terry fabrics. Water absorption is important for terry fabrics as well. Consequently, in this study, water vapour absorption and water evaporation from terry fabrics are investigated. Other extremely important physical properties of terry <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> are their permeability properties.
