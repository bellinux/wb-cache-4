5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length <b>wishbones,</b> inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E

25|$|The chassis was a tube frame based {{around a}} centre backbone; {{suspension}} was by Double <b>wishbones</b> {{and by a}} De Dion tube at the rear. Six 6C 3000 CM were built: four coupés and two spiders, bodied by Carrozzeria Colli.|$|E
50|$|Only {{a handful}} of the <b>Wishbone</b> episodes have been {{released}} to VHS and DVD. There were also a few computer games in 1996, such as <b>Wishbone</b> Activity Center and <b>Wishbone</b> and the Amazing Odyssey. <b>Wishbone</b> has also inspired several book series: <b>Wishbone</b> Classics, <b>Wishbone</b> Mysteries, and The Adventures of <b>Wishbone,</b> which is similar to the TV series.|$|R

25|$|In its service, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; {{went through}} 400 tyres; its brakes were changed 100 times; and it {{required}} six new clutches, two new hubs, driveshafts, <b>wishbones,</b> struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror.|$|E
25|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined lower <b>wishbones</b> for anti-dive effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section cross-member with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the level}} of {{suspension}}s, the 250 GT Lusso had double <b>wishbones</b> and coil springs at the front, while the rear suspension comprised a live axle, leaf springs, semi-elliptical concentric coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers.

The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta {{introduced}} a new drivetrain layout to the marque. Clutch and transmission were housed {{at the rear of}} the car, together with the differential for a more balanced weight distribution, as used on the Alfetta 158/159 Grand Prix cars. The suspension relied on double <b>wishbones</b> and torsion bars at the front and a De Dion tube at the rear. When leaving the factory all Alfettas originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 165HR14 tyres (CA67).|$|E
25|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} used Buick's standard design, {{with double}} <b>wishbones</b> {{up front and}} a live axle located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|E

25|$|Designed by Colin McRae and Dave Plant {{and built}} by DJM Race Preparation, the McRae R4's chassis {{is based on}} a steel safety cage with carbon {{panelling}} front and rear, and a steel-covered cockpit area. Suspension consists of twin <b>wishbones</b> with Proflex dampers. The body styling has been done by Keith Burden and Tom Webster. It appears that some components of the vehicle have been taken from existing production cars, the doorline in particular appears very close to that of the Ford Ka.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} of the DMC-12 is a four-wheel independent suspension, coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The front suspension uses double <b>wishbones,</b> while the rear is a multi-link setup. In its original development stages, the car {{is said to have}} handled quite well. Design drawings clearly show that the design met NHTSA minimum bumper and headlight heights of the time. Many owners have subsequently replaced or modified the front springs to return the front height to the original design specification.|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double <b>wishbones.</b> Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|E

25|$|The Ibec design, while bespoke, was not adventurous. The main chassis {{was formed}} by a riveted and bonded {{aluminium}} monocoque, behind which the DFV engine and Hewland FG400 gearbox were bolted as stressed chassis members. Suspension was by double <b>wishbones</b> at the front, with twin trailing arms, parallel lower links and single top links at the rear. The car was clothed in fibreglass bodywork which had been properly wind tunnel tested, and which proved highly effective at generating both downforce in corners and stability at high speed. The total cost of designing and building the 308LM was less than £100,000, approximately £0.5 million at 2005 prices, more than most privateer teams, but far lower than many contemporary factory race programs.|$|E
25|$|Like {{virtually}} all other theropods, Dakotaraptor likely possessed a furcula, or “wishbone”, {{as part of}} the shoulder girdle. Theropod <b>wishbones</b> are quite varied and often different from the strongly U-shaped furculae most modern birds possess; the elements originally identified as the furcula of Dakotaraptor were U- to V-shaped, similar to many other dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor, and even the large spinosaurid theropod Suchomimus. In 2015, a study by Victoria Megan Arbour et al. hypothesized that the presumed Dakotaraptor furculae in fact represented a part of a turtle armour, the entoplastron of Axestemys splendida, a member of the Trionychidae. In 2016, DePalma et al. recognized that none of the referred furculae actually belonged to Dakotaraptor, and excluded them from its hypodigm.|$|E
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double <b>wishbones</b> front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E

500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double <b>wishbones.</b> The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two radius rods locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel disc brakes are used on all four wheels and were of [...] diameter for the smaller wheels and [...] for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded Goodyear tyres throughout its racing career.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Courage Compétition {{introduced}} the C60 as a clean-sheet {{replacement for the}} Courage C52.
