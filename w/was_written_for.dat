5|$|A {{large portion}} of Clarke's music {{features}} the viola, as she was a professional performer for many years. Much of her output <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> herself and the all-female chamber ensembles she played in, including the Norah Clench Quartet, the English Ensemble, and the d'Aranyi Sisters. She also toured worldwide, particularly with cellist May Muklé. Her works were strongly influenced by several trends in 20th century classical music. Clarke also knew many leading composers of the day, including Bloch and Ravel, with whom her work has been compared.|$|E

5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E

5|$|Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski {{composed}} {{three pieces}} called Łańcuch ("Chain"), {{which refers to}} the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. Chain 2 <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier Partita for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and Chain 2 form his longest work.|$|E
5|$|In France, organ music {{developed}} during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its repertoire. The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> use during the Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written repertoire is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John Blow and John Stanley wrote multi-sectional free works for liturgical use called voluntaries through the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared for performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Kneale's {{remaining}} television work <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> ITV. His first {{script for}} ITV was the one-off play Murrain, {{made by the}} network's Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called Beasts, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.|$|E

The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue. This story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the desert climate of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E
