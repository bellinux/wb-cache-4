5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read passages from the Bible during services, after which Hensley <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student replied {{that it could be}} done, but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> 80â€“90 paratroopers onto the target.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E

He {{would make his}} debut to the company at the Genesis {{pay-per-view}} on January 17, 2010, working under the ring name Mr. Anderson. As a mystery opponent, he wrestled Abyss, whom he pinned after using brass knuckles, establishing himself as a heel in the process. Anderson made his Impact! debut on January 21, 2010. He <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> a promo explaining why he came to TNA and disparaging Abyss before he was attacked by Abyss.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, {{the troops were}} not briefed on the operation until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E
5|$|The Mukondo Mountain project, {{operated}} by the Central African Mining and Exploration Company in Katanga, may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It is estimated able to produce about one third of total global production of cobalt in 2008.

During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.|$|E
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E

5|$|In quick succession, Hermione, Troezen and Epidaurus {{surrendered}} to Cleomenes, who went from Argos to Corinth and started besieging the citadel. He sent a messenger to Aratus proposing that Acrocorinth should be garrisoned jointly {{by both the}} Spartans and the Achaeans, and that he <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> a twelve talent pension. Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let it fall to Cleomenes. He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon. Cleomenes invaded the territory of Sicyon and blockaded Aratus inside the city for three months before Aratus was able to escape to attend the Achaean council at Aegium.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|NASA has speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact that}} already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv over a few days is fatal.|$|E

Dickinson and Joe were allowed to travel towards the Anglo settlements, escorted by Ben, a former slave from the United States who served as Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook. Each woman was given $2 and a blanket and was allowed to go free and spread the news of the destruction that awaited those who opposed the Mexican government. Before releasing Joe, Santa Anna ordered that the surviving members of the Mexican Army parade in a grand review, in the hopes that Joe and Dickinson <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> a warning to the remainder of the Texian forces that his army was unbeatable.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of SzilÃ¡rd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told SzilÃ¡rd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told SzilÃ¡rd that he <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For SzilÃ¡rd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and SzilÃ¡rd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{received}} Stephen {{in person}} at her court in Gloucester, before having him moved to Bristol Castle, traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. Matilda now {{began to take}} the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen in his place, which would require the agreement of the Church and her coronation at Westminster. Stephen's brother Henry summoned a council at Winchester before Easter {{in his capacity as}} papal legate to consider the clergy's view. Matilda had made a private deal with Henry that he <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> the support of the Church in exchange for being granted control over Church affairs. Henry handed over the royal treasury to her, which proved to be rather depleted except for Stephen's crown, and he excommunicated many of her enemies who refused to switch sides. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen so rapidly, however, and a delegation of clergy and nobles, headed by Theobald, travelled to Bristol to see Stephen, who agreed that, given the situation, he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.|$|E

5|$|Back in MopÃ¡n, AmÃ©squeta had {{received}} additional supplies {{and decided to}} catch up with his advance party. He left MopÃ¡n on 10 March 1696 with friar AgustÃ­n Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from DÃ­az or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March AmÃ©squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find DÃ­az's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that DÃ­az had left behind. They followed DÃ­az's trail to the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that DÃ­az's party had passed that way, and AmÃ©squeta assumed that they had crossed to NojpetÃ©n. He wrote a letter to DÃ­az, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with AmÃ©squeta. During various attempts at communication to verify DÃ­az's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of AmÃ©squeta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in DÃ­az's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|The first coroner's inquest into Smith's suicide {{began in}} May 2011. The inquest, {{initially}} led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial; {{it was originally}} scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As {{a result of this}} challenge, the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11-month period of Smith's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September; the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner, apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011; the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she <b>would</b> <b>deliver</b> three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the inquest, and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury.|$|E

[...] Schnapf also expressed that the final result that he and Bolme had produced was not the album that Smith would have made, simply because Elliott was not around to finish the album. Bolme also {{said that they did}} not add anything to the songs, and only mixed whatever had been recorded: [...] "I would never presume to add anything. We didn't add anything." ...|$|R
