A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy. You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend {{to be such a}} genius as to have been sure of coming in first, {{in the case of a}} race for the discovery. And you see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money simply flowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances. I tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education except in chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing.

30|$|Per our algorithm, we do {{not remove}} thoracostomy tubes on wall suction. Martino et al. {{concluded}} that a trial of <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> appears to allow occult air leaks to become clinically apparent, thus potentially reducing the need for another thoracostomy tube (Martino et al. 1999). Furthermore, regarding wall suction versus <b>water</b> <b>seal,</b> the literature has suggested that suction compared to <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> does not reduce air leaks in patients whom have had a pulmonary resection. However, it could decrease the occurrence of postoperative PTX from early air leak (Deng et al. 2010). Further, {{this study did not}} involve trauma patients.

50|$|The name is also misleadingly {{used for}} a variety of {{alcoholic}} cocktails sold in Poland, usually of low quality and low content of alcohol. It could also be confused with its cognate, nalivka(Russian, Ukrainian: наливка), popular in Ukraine at least since the 17th century and in Russia at least since the 19th century. While the Polish nalewka is an infusion, i.e., made by infusing the berry/herb/fruit flavour into hard liquor, the Ukrainian/Russian nalivkas are made by filling the jar with berries, sugar and <b>water,</b> <b>sealing</b> it, and letting the content ferment for about 6 months. Thus, the Ukrainian/Russian nalivkas are much weaker (usually containing not more than 18-20% of alcohol), sweeter and have a more concentrated berry aroma. The proper name for a Russian analogue of a Polish nalewka would be nastoika, infusion. (настойка, настоянка, literally, tincture). Large well-stocked Russian bars feature hundreds of such nastoikas, made by infusing various herbs (e.g., tarragon), vegetables (e.g., pepper, horseradish), fruits (e.g., lemon) and berries (e.g., cranberry) into vodka. For example, Stolichnaya exports 15 various nastoikas.|$|E

40|$|Metam sodium is {{the most}} widely used soil {{fumigant}} in the United States. The primary breakdown product of metam sodium in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the rate and efficiency of conversion of metam sodium to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion of metam sodium to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content of metam sodium in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application of metam sodium. Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> compared to uncovered soil columns after subsurface application of metam sodium. When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> with subsurface application of metam sodium may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} (ML = 7. 3) and the following typhoon induced heavy rainfalls and floods, the tailrace tunnel of the Kukuan Hydropower Plant was severely blocked and must be realigned and rebuilt. The new tailrace tunnel is 1991 m long with a 140 m section passing underneath the Tachia River, where the shallowest rock cover is 3. 5 m. In view of the common phenomenon that weak zone developed along river channel and debris accumulated on river bed, the ground improvement from the surface to the tunnel is difficult. Therefore, a construction shaft, a <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> pre-grouting plan and a special supporting system were designed to prevent the potential water inflow when tunneling underneath the Tachia River. In the construction phase, adequate excavation cross sections, support elements, auxiliary treatments, and <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> grouting methods were selected to overcome the difficult ground condition encountered. The experience learned from this successful case can be a valuable reference for the design and construction of similar river crossing tunnels in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the civil}} {{engineering}} field, water-swelling materials {{are often used}} as joint sealing materials to improve water cut-off performance in the joints of the steel (pipe) sheet pile. In short, water-swelling materials are extremely effective as <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> materials. However, many characteristics of water-swelling materials {{have not yet been}} proved, and one of the unproven characteristics is the swelling pressure. Solving the issue of the swelling pressure will contribute to improving <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> in the joints of the steel (pipe) sheet pile. At the same time, it is also expected to greatly contribute to the application of water-swelling materials for other purposes, or the new development and improvement of water-swelling materials. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove the characteristics of swelling pressure of water-swelling materials which are applied to joint sealing materials, e. g., a steel (pipe) sheet pile, etc., and to experimentally evaluate the swelling pressure of water-swelling materials. The results we obtained are : (1) the swelling pressure depends on the membrane thickness of the water-swelling materials. The thicker a membrane becomes, the bigger the pressure tends to be. (2) While the swelling pressure is not much influenced by the temperature of the water to be immersed, it is influenced by the quality of water to be immersed. Similar to the traits of the swelling rate, the swelling pressure when immersed in artificial sea water is lower compared with that when immersed in freshwater. (3) For example, water-swelling materials 1 mm thick achieve a swelling pressure of 6. 7 MPa when immersed in fresh water, and 4. 2 MPa when immersed in artificial sea water, respectively. Accordingly, we assume they should fully perform the swelling functions under a restricted environment as well...|$|E
