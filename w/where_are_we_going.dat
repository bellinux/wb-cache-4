25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> <b>Going?.</b> In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

500|$|Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to}} be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might {{have thought it was}} just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: Where do we come from? What are we? <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going?</b> Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

6000|$|We found {{ourselves}} in a dining room with a long white table and inverted soup-plates, tomb-cold, lighted by an acetylene flare. Three men had accompanied us: the carabiniere, a little dark youth with a small black moustache, in a soldier's short, wool-lined great-coat: and {{a young man who}} looked tired round his blue eyes, and who wore a dark-blue overcoat, quite smart. The be-shawled damsel came in with the inevitable bowl of minestrone, soup with cabbage and cauliflower and other things. We helped ourselves, and the fat carabiniere started the conversation with the usual questions--and <b>where</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> tomorrow? ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Where</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> and <b>where</b> had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> and <b>where</b> did <b>we</b> live? And ah, yes, English {{people lived}} in Italy.

But the English--what could be better for them than Italy now: they had sun, they had warmth, they had abundance of everything, they had a charming people to deal with, {{and they had the}} cambio!

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} use of {{the desktop}} metaphor as the primary means of interacting with information is perhaps the earliest, and arguably the most profound, landmark of user interface design. Ironically, such a success is both a great past achievement and a difficult future challenge to overcome. Computing technologies and user experiences available to people in our current web-driven world are evolving rapidly. In fact, the strict concept of the desktop metaphor is already a “straw man ” notion, but it can help us characterize <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> already in mid-flight from the desktop metaphor to somewhere else. Although <b>we</b> cannot <b>be</b> sure <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> <b>we</b> can discern different dimensions in which things are changing. The research presented in the chapters of this book represents some notable efforts in moving beyond desktop-metaphor-based computing. In this concluding chapter we reflect and comment on seven dimensions of change along which we see future integrated digital work environments being different, as experienced by users, from today’s computing environment. Our analyses and speculations {{are based on the}} chapters in this book and our own research, as well as the HCI literature and information technology trends in general. In the spirit o...|$|R
