40|$|Abstract. Todetermine {{the effect}} ofwheel traffic and two differentmanagement {{practices}} on soil compaction {{and its consequences}} on physical and chemical soil properties, we measured penetration resistance, water infiltration, bulk density, macroporosity, chemical mobility, air permeability, and soil strength in a conventional orchard (integrated fruit-production program) with bare (sprayed with herbicides) rows and an organic apple orchard with grassed rows. Resistance measurements were taken both within the tree row and the <b>wheel</b> <b>track,</b> down {{to a depth of}} 0. 35 to 0. 40 m. The results indicate that compaction is greater in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> under both management methods. Compaction in the <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> was higher under organic than conventional management. Organic management resulted in a higher macroporosity in both the row and the wheel-track than conventional management. The ‘close-to-saturation’ infiltration rate was significantly greater within the row of the organic orchard (0. 06 m/h) compared with the row of the conventional orchard (0. 02 m/h), and compared with the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> (0. 01 m/h). The precompression stress value in the top 100 mm, ameasure of the soil strength, was low on all sites. The chemicalmobilitieswere 57 and 50 % in the organic orchard, and 86 and 93 % in the conventional orchard, respectively, for <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> and row. Apart from the compaction in the <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> of the organic orchard, physical and chemical soil characteristics were in a better condition compared with the conventional orchard...|$|R

40|$|In the Road Condition Model {{one wants}} to be able to predict the {{transition}} between different winter road conditions. One such example is the transition from loose snow all across the driving lane to loose snow except in <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks,</b> where the condition is changed to ice or bare road. Each vehicle passing as long as there is loose snow across the whole driving lane will remove a certain amount of loose snow from the developing <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The amount of removed loose snow is assumed to vary between different types of vehicles. The Road Weather Information System, RWIS, delivers information on the amount of loose snow falling on the road. The traffic flow is measured by inductive loops. The amount of loose snow in <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> is measured intermittent. Then one has information of traffic flow and the amount of removed loose snow from <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> (determined as the difference between the amount af loose snow falling on the road and the amount remaining in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks).</b> Trough regression analysis one can determine the statistical relation between traffic flow and amount of removed loose snow. However, one problem is that on some occasions there is no loose snow at all remaining in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> at the time of observation. In that case one can assume that the observed amount of traffic flow would have removed more snow if the snow fall would have been heavier.

The study {{was carried out in}} a randomized complete block design in a split plot arrangement, with the following treatments: traditional mechanical harvesting, mechanical harvesting with traffic control, mechanical harvesting with traffic control and automatic tractor guidance.

40|$|The {{movement}} {{characteristics of}} aggregates in asphalt mixtures were investigated with <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests under the following loading conditions: reciprocating motion, one-way motion, and one-way motion with braking. The outside <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests used fine and gap graded (13 F) asphalt mixtures. The {{tests showed that}} the amount of rutting in one-way motion was larger than that in reciprocating motion. In the case of reciprocating motion, the surface heaved up at the right load end. In the case of one-way motion, the surface heaved up at the point 50 mm from both contact ends of the tire. Consolidation caused the rutting phenomenon during reciprocating motion, and flow caused the rutting phenomenon during one-way motion, based on the movement of aggregates as viewed from the right-angle direction to the loading. Therefore, the rutting phenomenon including the deformation in the transverse direction can be analyzed by <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests based on one-way motion, or reciprocating motion, using the conventional <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> test. However, in the case of rutting during one-way motion with braking, the movement of aggregates in the wheel direction caused by tire friction was larger than movement in the depth direction. The inside of the asphalt mixture was dragged by tire friction in the wheel direction. Therefore, at locations where brake operation is frequently needed, the rutting phenomenon caused by flow and abrasion will be greater. 室外で作製した細粒度ギャップアスファルト混合物（ 13 F）に関して，往復走行，一方向走行およびブレーキ走行が可能なホイールトラッキング（WT）試験機を用いて，ホイールトラッキング試験中における内部の骨材の動きの違いを明らかにした。解析結果より，ホイールトラッキング試験による走行荷重直下のわだち掘れは往復走行より一方向走行の方が大きくなり，側方部の隆起は往復走行では荷重端部の右側で生じ，一方向走行では荷重端部から 50 mm程度離れた箇所に生じた。また，荷重直角方向の骨材の動きより，往復走行では圧密によるわだち掘れが主であり，一方向走行では流動によるわだち掘れが主であることが明らかとなった。この結果から，WT試験は往復走行とともに，実際のアスファルト舗装と同様の走行方法である一方向走行も行うことが，横断方向への変形も含めたわだち掘れ現象の解明につながると考えられる。ブレーキ走行を行った結果より，タイヤの摩擦による骨材の動きは鉛直下方向よりも走行方向の方が大きい。これは，タイヤの摩擦によりアスファルト混合物の内部が走行方向へ引きずられるためである。よって，車両のブレーキ操作が頻繁に必要となる場所では，流動によるわだち掘れおよび摩耗によるわだち掘れが生じると考えられる...|$|R

40|$|A new creep test, Partial Triaxial Test (PTT), was {{developed}} to study the permanent deformation properties of asphalt mixtures. The PTT used two duplicate platens whose diameters were smaller than {{the diameter of the}} cylindrical asphalt mixtures specimen. One base platen was centrally placed under the specimen and another loading platen was centrally placed on the top surface of the specimen. Then the compressive repeated load was applied on the loading platen and the vertical deformation of the asphalt mixture was recorded in the PTTs. Triaxial repeated load permanent deformation tests (TRT) and PTTs were respectively conducted on AC 20 and SMA 13 asphalt mixtures at 40 °C and 60 °C so as to provide the parameters of the creep constitutive relations in the ABAQUS finite element models (FEMs) which were built to simulate the laboratory <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests.

40|$|Abstract — Rutting {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{pavement}} distresses which led to lower riding comfort for road users and high maintenance costs. One of the widely used tests is the simulation test using the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> device. In this study, efforts have been made to evaluate rutting of dense graded hot mix asphalt (HMA) using the dynamic modulus Simple Performance test (SPT). Granite aggregates from Klang Valley located in the central region of Peninsular Malaysia were used to produce the HMA mixtures with two different types of aggregate gradation designed using Superpave and Marshall mix design method. The rut evaluation was selected from SPT dynamic modulus test conducted at 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C and 5 Hz, 2 Hz, 1 Hz and 0. 5 Hz loading frequencies.

40|$|The {{shakedown}} {{concept has}} been widely applied in structural and mechanical engineering numerical models. The concept {{is related to the}} response of a structure to load repetitions in a resilient manner without further permanent deformation. More than 40 <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests were conducted with various wheel load levels for each test to check the validity of the shakedown concept in the pavement foundation. Six different types of soils with different characteristics were used in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests. These were a silt (from gravel pit washings), a silty-clay (Mercia Mudstone, referred to here by its earlier name of Keuper Marl), two sands (Portaway and Langford Fill), and two crushed rocks (Carboniferous Limestone and Granite). Three different sized wheel-tracking facilities were used; a small wheel tracker (SW), a larger Slab Testing Facility (STF) and the half-scale Nottingham Pavement Testing Facility (PTF). These allowed various wheel specifications and test specimen sizes to be investigated. The test programme embraced one, two and three layered systems. The permanent vertical deformation of each system was measured after a certain number of passes. The soil is said to be under shakedown if after a certain number of passes, there is no further permanent deformation. The experimental result was compared with the theoretical shakedown prediction. A series of static triaxial tests for each soil, with the test conditions close to the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests, was carried out to identify the shear strength to be used as input parameters for the theoretical shakedown prediction.
