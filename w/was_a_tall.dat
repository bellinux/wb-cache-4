5|$|Goebel {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1919. He studied engineering and received his degree in 1923. While at Michigan, he played football under head coach Fielding H. Yost. He played at the end where he developed {{a reputation as one}} of the country's best forward pass receivers and as a tenacious defensive player. At 6-feet, 3-inches, Goebel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> player in his era. He started seven games in each of the 1920 and 1921 seasons at right end for the Wolverines, and was limited due to injury to five games in 1922. In 1921, he was chosen as an All-American and was voted the captain of the 1922 team. Goebel also excelled as an honor student in the University's engineering school. Goebel also earned the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency in academics and athletics.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|Spinosaurids {{appear to}} have been {{widespread}} from the Barremian to the Cenomanian ages of the Cretaceous, about 130 to 95 million years ago. They shared features such as long, narrow, crocodile-like skulls; sub-circular teeth, with fine to no serrations; the snout rosette, and a secondary palate which made them more resistant to torsion. In contrast, the primitive and typical condition for theropods <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> narrow snout with blade-like teeth serrated front and back. The skull adaptations of spinosaurids converged with those of crocodilians; early members of the latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods, later developing elongated snouts, conical teeth, and secondary palates. These adaptations may have been the result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish. Unlike crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of most spinosaurids (except Spinosaurus) do not {{appear to have}} aquatic adaptations. Sereno and colleagues proposed that the large thumb-claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in the Middle Jurassic, before the elongation of the skull and other adaptations related to fish-eating, since the former features are shared with their megalosaurid relatives. They also suggested that the spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

However, their early record of poor reliability had meant that catching Renault in either Drivers' or Constructors' Championships <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> order.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} chapel was a stuccoed {{building in}} a broadly Classical style, with rounded sash windows and a pediment with the Prince's coat of arms. A row of Doric columns flanked the entrance. Inside there were galleries on each wall, supported by decorated columns. The gallery above the altar contained the organ, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> highly decorated pulpit. The alterations of 1876â€“1877 removed the gallery above the altar and added a chancel, separated from the nave by an iron rood screen, new pulpit and lectern.|$|E

The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> pillar set on a triangular base atop a series of steps surrounded by granite supports and a sturdy iron railing. At the top of the original obelisk were three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off while in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|The Bible {{provides}} a famous slinger account, {{the battle between}} David and Goliath from the First Book of Samuel 17:34-36, probably written in the 7th or 6th century BC, describing events having occurred around the 10th century BC. The sling, easily produced, was the weapon of choice for shepherds fending off animals. Due to this, the sling was a commonly used weapon by the Israelite militia. Goliath <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> well equipped and experienced warrior. In this account, the shepherd David convinces Saul to let him fight Goliath {{on behalf of the}} Israelites.

25|$|The {{son of a}} Latvian-born {{construction}} worker, Zesers ascended {{quickly to}} first-class ranks. He was selected {{at the age of}} 17 years and 256 days to represent South Australia against Tasmania in late 1984, whilst still a student at Marden High School after less than a year in grade cricket. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> fast bowler, and demonstrated all-round potential when he scored 85 and took 6/76 in a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in his debut season. This earned him selection on the 198485 Australian Under-19 team to tour Sri Lanka and India. His efforts in claiming 11 wickets at an average of just 12, put him into contention for higher honours in the limited overs format. By the age of 21, Zesers had collected more than 100 first class wickets, the only person to have achieved this feat.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> {{powerful}} middle-order batsman {{and occasional}} medium-pace bowler. In his youth {{he was also}} a strong cover point fielder. He wore his famous glasses as a result of being poked in the eye with a ruler. His Test match debut came in 1966. Lloyd scored 7,515 runs at Test level, at an average of 46.67. He hit 70 sixes in his Test career, which is the 14th highest number of any player. He played for his home nation of Guyana in West Indies domestic cricket, and for Lancashire (he was made captain in 1981) in England. He is a cousin of spin bowler Lance Gibbs. Since retiring as a player, Lloyd has remained heavily involved in cricket, managing the West Indies in the late 1990s, and coaching and commentating. He was an ICC match referee from 2001â€“2006.|$|E
25|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> and bulky {{person with}} a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
