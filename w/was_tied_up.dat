5|$|After Burke's first {{campaign}} for alderman, {{he has been}} unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns. In 2007, Burke faced his first opponent since 1971, a school teacher who had never run for office. A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged {{the validity of the}} opponent's ballot application, but the case <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in court for most of the campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E

25|$|Commander of the Red Army Northwestern Front, Markian Popov demanded all out {{attacks on}} the Axis by the VVS. Although the VVS North-Western Front had 560 aircraft, they were {{dispersed}} because of another attack by the Finnish Army in the Karelian Isthmus, north of Leningrad. To support the defence in the north, 162 Soviet aircraft were dispatched. The VVS KBF Naval Aviation <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in supporting the Soviet 8th Army in the Battle of Estonia and attacking Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} the Irish Volunteers was that action {{would only be}} taken were the British authorities at Dublin Castle to attempt to disarm the Volunteers, arrest their leaders, or introduce conscription to Ireland. The IRB, however, was determined to use the Volunteers for offensive action while Britain <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in the First World War. Their plan was to circumvent MacNeill's command, instigating a Rising, and to get MacNeill on board once the rising was a fait accompli.|$|E

He executed a sale-and-leaseback deal with Marlin Properties, a Los Angeles historical renovation developer, for $1.5 million, but a $250,000 payment from Marlin was returned for nonsufficient funds in 1985. Before MacDonald could begin foreclosure proceedings, Marlin declared bankruptcy and the hotel's ownership <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> in litigation for nearly a decade.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, as Corey's {{politics}} {{turned against}} his Stalinist beliefs, he ran {{afoul of the}} Federal prosecutors. In December 1950, Corey was served with a deportation warrant from the US Department of Justice charging {{that he had been}} in the country illegally almost his entire life and for being a Communist. His father had come to the United States without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector. The case <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> for years, and his application for a Certificate of Lawful Entry was denied under the McCarren Act.|$|E

Jesse Oliver Kinnie, a North Vancouver Ferry employee, looked into the possibility of purchasing North Vancouver Ferry No. 4 and running it on the same route as she had run all her life. She had a higher height clearance on the car deck than Ferry No. 5 and was faster. The numbers did not add up and the plan was abandoned. Ferry No. 4 also ran on a Union Diesel.|$|E

His left skate appeared to hit the post first before his right leg crashed into it around the shin area. He tried to get up twice before going down to the ice in pain, grabbing his leg just above the ankle. After a brief delay, a stretcher was brought out and he was taken off to loud applause. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Stamkos entered the day tied for the NHL's lead in scoring with Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{lasted until}} 10 February 1943, {{when the final}} remaining Australians were evacuated, making them the last Allied land forces to leave South East Asia following the Japanese offensives of 1941–42. As a result, an entire Japanese division <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> on Timor {{for more than six}} months, preventing its deployment elsewhere. Although Portugal was not a combatant, many East Timorese civilians and Portuguese European colonists fought with the Allies, or provided them with food, shelter and other assistance. Some Timorese continued a resistance campaign following the Australian withdrawal. For this, they paid a heavy price {{and tens of thousands of}} Timorese civilians died as a result of the Japanese occupation, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.|$|E

On 8 May, he was taken from his home by personnel of Punjab Police. According to Sethi's wife Mohsin, at least eight armed officers broke into the house, assaulting the family's security guards; when asked to produce a warrant, one of them threatened simply to shoot Sethi on the spot. Mohsin <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> and left locked in another room.|$|E
