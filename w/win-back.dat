40|$|In this work, we {{presented}} the strategies and techniques {{that we have}} developed for predicting the near-future churners and <b>win-backs</b> for a telecom company. On a large-scale and real-world database containing customer profiles and some transaction data from a telecom company, we first analyzed the data schema, developed feature computation strategies and then extracted a large set of relevant features that {{can be associated with}} the customer churning and returning behaviors. Our features include both the original driver factors as well as some derived features. We evaluated our features on the imbalance corrected dataset, i. e. under-sampled dataset and compare a large number of existing machine learning tools, especially decision tree-based classifiers, for predicting the churners and <b>win-backs.</b> In general, we find RandomForest and SimpleCart learning algorithms generally perform well and tend to provide us with highly competitive prediction performance. Among the top- 15 driver factors that signal the churn behavior, we find that the service utilization, e. g. last two months' download and upload volume, last three months' average upload and download, and the payment related factors are the most indicative features for predicting if churn will happen soon. Such features can collectively tell discrepancies between the service plans, payments and the dynamically changing utilization needs of the customers. Our proposed features and their computational strategy exhibit reasonable precision performance to predict churn behavior in near future...|$|R

50|$|Analytical {{customer}} relationship management (CRM) is a frequent commercial application of predictive analysis. Methods of predictive analysis are applied to customer data to pursue CRM objectives, which involve constructing a holistic view of the customer no matter where their information resides in the company or the department involved. CRM uses predictive analysis in applications for marketing campaigns, sales, and customer services to name a few. These tools are required {{in order for a}} company to posture and focus their efforts effectively across the breadth of their customer base. They must analyze and understand the products in demand or have the potential for high demand, predict customers' buying habits in order to promote relevant products at multiple touch points, and proactively identify and mitigate issues that have the potential to lose customers or reduce their ability to gain new ones. Analytical {{customer relationship}} management can be applied throughout the customers lifecycle (acquisition, relationship growth, retention, and <b>win-back).</b> Several of the application areas described below (direct marketing, cross-sell, customer retention) are part of {{customer relationship management}}.|$|E

40|$|With firms losing {{an average}} of 25 % of their {{customer}} base every year, understanding and engaging unresponsive customers has become more critical than ever. We characterize unresponsive customers as either prospects that have never purchased from a firm, or former customers that have not purchased in at least twelve months. Since 55 % of all communication is non-verbal, how can online firms cut through the silence and engage these unresponsive customers digitally? Our paper is an exploration into the three current management strategies firms implement to reach the unresponsive customer: acquisition, retargeting, and <b>win-back.</b> Included is an examination into recent technological advancements that provide a new layer of visibility into the behavior and emotion of the unresponsive customer. We also discuss how Emotional Value, which is described as the economic worth of feelings, can be implemented to more effectively <b>win-back</b> customers. by Alan O. Ringvald and Abraham C.

40|$|Every day, {{salespeople}} span boundaries, coordinate {{internal and}} external expertise, leverage social capital, mobilize the tangible and intangible resources of their firm, and try to create value for all stakeholders. Recognizing the important roles of salespeople, Evans et al. (2012) and Lassk et al. (2012) call for more research on the usage of skills, knowledge, people, strategies, expertise, and other resources of salespeople to produce the desired outcomes. Responding to their calls, this study specifically focuses on how salespeople utilize their available and finite resources across four types of customers (new customers, short term customers, long term customers, and <b>win-back</b> customers) to identify and qualify new sales opportunities during the prospecting stage. The dissertation focuses on seven types of resources (capturing both internal and firm related resources) available for salespeople: (1) firm tangible, (2) firm intangible, (3) firm market based, (4) present resources, (5) skills, (6) knowledge, and (7) accumulated successes. The study further explores the moderating roles of organizational identification, competitive intensity, and customer dependence {{on the relationship between}} resources utilized and performance during the prospecting stage. The resource utilization scale is developed and tested for robustness. Next, using a final dataset of 346 responses from salespeople, the results reveal that salespeople adaptively utilized various resources across new customers, short-term customers, long-term customers, and <b>win-back</b> (lost) customers. Overall, performance during prospecting stage are more strongly influenced by utilization of internal resources (presence, knowledge, skills and success) than firm related factors. Further, successful prospecting performance requires the usage of skills and knowledge resources with new customers, only skills resources with short-term and long-term customers, but present resources, knowledge, and firm tangible resources with <b>win-back</b> customers. In addition, organizational identification and competitive intensity moderate the relationship between resource utilization and prospecting performance for all customer types, whereas customer dependence is an important moderator for long-term customers. The paper makes several contributions to key areas such as resource allocations in the context of personal selling, and how firms can strategically enhance the performance of their salespeople. Theoretically, the study develops resource utilization scale, and empirically tests its effects on prospecting performance. From a managerial stand point, this dissertation offers additional insights into the effectiveness of each type of resources to plan for selective development of resources, as well as focused sales training...|$|E
30|$|Future {{research}} can also study {{the effect of}} face in the Chinese context (Shi, Ichiro & Jin, 2011; Shi, Kuang & Yang, 2017) to explain how test publicity affects individuals’ self-serving attributional bias. The relevance of results to an individuals’ performance evaluation can be another important factor that influences the effect of test publicity. Team climate (trust, safety) and perceived leader support may also affect how people interpret their public failures. In entrepreneurship research, scholars can also study how people react to entrepreneurial failures differently when the enterprise is well-known or famous. In a service-related context, how employees attribute their service failure and the related effect on their <b>win-back</b> management may be examined (Tang, Chou & Chen, 2008; Tang et al., 2010).|$|E
30|$|Customer <b>win-back</b> is a {{cognitive}} process of satisfaction changing {{from a low}} level to a high level with service recovery strategies as the stimulus. Because prior research tends to view service recovery strategies as a static antecedent, {{it is difficult to}} analyze and observe how the recovery strategies affect satisfaction and repurchase intention dynamically. Moreover, not enough attention has been directed to the relationship between reasons of customer loss and recovery strategies. This research conducted a field experiment involving a 2 × 2 between-subjects design (defects of service attitude and unfair price × tangible recovery and intangible recovery strategies). From a longitudinal and dynamic perspective, this study has produced the following key results: First, there are significant differences in satisfaction and purchase intention between the four groups categorized by specific reasons of customer loss. Second, recovery strategies may have non-linear effects on customer’s satisfaction. Lastly, based on the prospect theory and disappointment theory, we discuss important managerial implications of the function curves fitted between customer satisfactory (before customer loss and after implementation of customer winback strategy) and purchase intention.|$|E

40|$|Business {{now faces}} the new {{challenge}} of management of digitalized services, especially service innovation under rapid technology evolution. Management of ICT service innovation has been advocated {{as a new}} and promising research field for IS researchers. This thesis attempts to address the strategic issue of ICT service innovation in the consumer market with three essays. The first essay looks at end users' migration decision when {{a new generation of}} ICT services is introduced. W proposed four categories of factors that influence end users' platform migration intention, namely attitudinal beliefs, control beliefs, normative beliefs, and belief about the technology advancements in the new generation. Furthermore, the co-diffusion of multiple technology generations is explicitly modeled by distinguishing three types of migration situations, namely transformative, leapfrogging, and incremental. We received empirical support for our conceptual model and derive both theoretical and managerial implications. Essay two conducted a comprehensive study of the impacts of ICT service innovation on end user loyalty. Three ICT service strategies were examined from the end user perspective, namely technology leadership, service leadership, and customization control. We cross-validate our model by comparing results from the wired Internet sample with those from the mobile Internet sample. The empirical findings from our research show supports for the main effects of the strategies on switching intention and behavior and support for the interactions among them. This study contributes to the promising research field of service management and service science, particularly to the management of service innovation in the consumer market. Essay Three addresses the issue of winning back ICT disadopters when a new technology generation appears on the market. Integrating research on innovation management, attitude strength and change, and consumer <b>win-back,</b> we propose a re-adoption model to predict disadopters' intentions to come back. We found that perceived superiority of a new technology generation, prior usage experience, and price value are significant enablers, and their influences are moderated by the reason for disadoption. These findings have significant managerial and theoretical implications. Overall, the three studies target at contributing to the research on service science and management in general and ICT service innovation in particular...|$|E
