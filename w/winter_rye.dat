60|$|There is a slumbering {{subterranean}} fire {{in nature}} which never goes out, and which no cold can chill. It finally melts the great snow, and in January or July is only buried under a thicker or thinner covering. In the coldest day it flows somewhere, {{and the snow}} melts around every tree. This field of <b>winter</b> <b>rye,</b> which sprouted late in the fall, and now speedily dissolves the snow, is where the fire is very thinly covered. We feel warmed by it. In the winter, warmth stands for all virtue, and we resort in thought to a trickling rill, with its bare stones shining in the sun, and to warm springs in the woods, with as much eagerness as rabbits and robins. The steam which rises from swamps and pools, is as dear and domestic as that of our own kettle. What fire could ever equal the sunshine of a winter's day, when the meadow mice come out by the wallsides, and the chicadee lisps in the defiles of the wood? The warmth comes directly from the sun, and is not radiated from the earth, as in summer; and when we feel his beams on our backs as we are treading some snowy dell, we are grateful as for a special kindness, and bless the sun which has followed us into that by-place.|$|E
60|$|In {{the winter}} of '46-7 there came a hundred men of Hyperborean {{extraction}} swoop down on to our pond one morning, with many carloads of ungainly-looking farming tools--sleds, plows, drill-barrows, turf-knives, spades, saws, rakes, and each man was armed with a double-pointed pike-staff, such as is not described in the New-England Farmer or the Cultivator. I {{did not know whether}} they had come to sow a crop of <b>winter</b> <b>rye,</b> or some other kind of grain recently introduced from Iceland. As I saw no manure, I judged that they meant to skim the land, as I had done, thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long enough. They said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the scenes, wanted to double his money, which, as I understood, amounted to half a million already; but in order to cover each one of his dollars with another, he took off the only coat, ay, the skin itself, of Walden Pond {{in the midst of a}} hard winter. They went to work at once, plowing, barrowing, rolling, furrowing, in admirable order, as if they were bent on making this a model farm; but when I was looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself, with a peculiar jerk, clean down to the sand, or rather the water--for it was a very springy soil--indeed all the terra firma there was--and haul it away on sleds, and then I guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog. So they came and went every day, with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive, from and to some point of the polar regions, as it seemed to me, like a flock of arctic snow-birds. But sometimes Squaw Walden had her revenge, and a hired man, walking behind his team, slipped through a crack in the ground down toward Tartarus, and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man, almost gave up his animal heat, and was glad to take refuge in my house, and acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove; or sometimes the frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a plowshare, or a plow got set in the furrow and had to be cut out.|$|E

With {{the exception of a}} few isolated cases and the somewhat more extended patch in Howard and Winneshiek counties, all the damage could be included within a line drawn southwest from Dubuque to Des Moines, and from Des Moines south to the border of the state. Throughout this region there was an extended and severe drouth during the preceding spring and fall, and but little rain, so that the bugs had an opportunity to hibernate under excellent conditions. In many cases wheat and barley were badly injured, and in some cases rye, but in most cases where <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>rye</b> were attacked the grain ripened early enough to avoid serious injury, although the bugs developed in such numbers as to cause great injury to adjacent fields of oats and corn. Throughout this area Osage hedges are a very common feature of the farms. In a great proportion of the reports received it is evident that these, or conditions similar to the presence of hedges, have permitted the hibernation of the bugs, and that in most cases the movement has been directly from such places into the fields of wheat or rye most convenient. It would seldom appear that the bugs traveled any great distance from their place of secretion. A point that is rather interesting is that the bugs have been most injurious in regions where <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>rye</b> have been a common crop for some years past, while in the districts where spring wheat or barley are the principal crops there has been less injury. The inference would see in to be that while <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>rye</b> were not so seriously injured by the bugs they furnished the most favorable conditions for their development in early spring, possibly furnished them winter quarters, and, as a result, other crops in their vicinity are more seriously attacked...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{loss from}} applied {{fertilizer}} {{can be a}} significant environmental quality issue if NO 3 moves to surface or ground water. The Iowa nutrient reduction strategy science assessment identified <b>winter</b> cereal <b>rye</b> (Secale cereal L.) cover crop as a practice that can significantly reduce N and P loss (41 % NO 3 -N and 21 % P reduction) from corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr. ] fields. Cereal rye, when used as a cover crop, through its fibrous root system is able to explore the soil and use residual NO 3 - N. In order to further understand the effectiveness of rye as a cover crop for scavenging and recycling N, {{there is a need}} to understand the amount of root/shoot biomass and N and carbon (C) partitioning between roots and shoots at the time of rye termination. This study was conducted at the Climate and Corn-Based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project (CSCAP) cover crop site, located at the Ag. Engineering and Agronomy Research Farm, Iowa State University near Boone, IA. Corn was grown in rotation with soybean and <b>winter</b> cereal <b>rye</b> drilled following corn and soybean harvest (three N rates applied to corn, 0, 120, and 200 lb N/acre). Two ingrowth tubes per plot were installed between rye rows in fall of 2014 after rye seeding and the tubes were harvested the next spring at the time of rye termination. For rye following corn and soybean, shoot biomass, C, and N was significantly greater than in the root biomass, with about 30 % of the total plant C and 15 % of the total N in the root biomass. The C:N ratio of root material was consistently high (46 - 51 C:N), and at least double the shoot material (17 - 23 C:N). Therefore, N taken up by the rye was mainly partitioned to the shoot, and thus measurement of rye cover crop aboveground biomass provides the main N amount available for recycling from the rye cover crop. With the high C fraction and high C:N ratio of the root material, inorganic-N from the soil or degrading shoot material could be immobilized with root degradation...|$|R

A three-year {{study was conducted to}} determine the impact of terminated small grain winter cover crops, which are hosts for Meloidogyne incognita, on cotton yield, root galling and nematode midseason population density. The small plot test consisted of the cover treatment as the main plots (<b>winter</b> fallow, oats, <b>rye</b> and wheat) and rate of aldicarb applied in-furrow at-plant (0, 0. 59 and 0. 84 kg a. i. /ha) as subplots in a split-plot design with eight replications, arranged in a randomized complete block design. Roots of 10 cotton plants per plot were examined at approximately 35 days after planting. Root galling was affected by aldicarb rate (9. 1, 3. 8 and 3. 4 galls/root system for 0, 0. 59 and 0. 84 kg aldicarb/ha), but not by cover crop. Soil samples were collected in mid-July and assayed for nematodes. The winter fallow plots had a lower density of M. incognita second-stage juveniles (J 2) (transformed to Log 10 (J 2 + 1) / 500 cm 3 soil) than any of the cover crops (0. 88, 1. 58, 1. 67 and 1. 75 Log 10 (J 2 + 1) / 500 cm 3 soil for <b>winter</b> fallow, oats, <b>rye</b> and wheat, respectively). There were also fewer M. incognita eggs at midseason in the winter fallow (3, 512, 7, 953, 8, 262 and 11, 392 eggs/ 500 cm 3 soil for <b>winter</b> fallow, oats, <b>rye</b> and wheat, respectively). Yield (kg lint per ha) was increased by application of aldicarb (1, 544, 1, 710 and 1, 697 for 0, 0. 59 and 0. 84 kg aldicarb/ha), but not by any cover crop treatments. These results were consistent over three years. The soil temperature at 15 cm depth, from when soils reached 18 °C to termination of the grass cover crop, averaged 9, 588, 7, 274 and 1, 639 centigrade hours (with a minimum threshold of 10 °C), in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

5000|$|Miry usually {{practiced the}} common-field system, {{in which all}} peasants grew the same crop in the same part of the mir's arable at the same time. Thus the whole harvest on a {{particular}} area could be gathered at the same time. This was necessary because of the peasants' custom of pasturing their livestock on the stubble. To preserve soil fertility on the arable, the mir generally employed a crop-rotation with fallow. The distribution of different crops would be `cycled' around from year to year. The most widespread system in use was the three-course or triennial rotation. One-third of the land was dedicated to <b>winter</b> grain (<b>rye</b> or <b>winter</b> wheat), another third to spring grain (oats or spring wheat) and the remainder lay fallow.
