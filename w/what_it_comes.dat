500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> down to." ...|$|E
500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> down to is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the filibuster, Wyden, {{addressing}} the presiding officer, said [...] "Mr. President, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> {{down to is}} every American {{has the right to}} know when their government believes that it is allowed to kill them." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} really vividly, you know, having {{pizza with}} my friends {{a day or two}} after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, [...] "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." [...] But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> down to is we just cared more.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{terrorism}} experts {{thought there}} was a connection in Muhammed's case to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives and religious inspiration. Neil Livingstone, a terrorism consultant, said that people on the margins of society are [...] "easy marks" [...] for recruiters offering them ideological and fanatical religious justifications for violence, noting [...] "Most of these guys — I think <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> down to — they're misfits, they believe they've suffered injustice. ... They basically are striking back at society." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{panorama}} was <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be associated with. Namely, it redefined the [...] to incorporate the material.
