5|$|Franco's plane {{landed in}} Gran Canaria on July 14, but, based in Tenerife, {{he would have}} been unable to make the plane without the death of General Amado Balmes, {{military}} commander in Gran Canaria, who was killed in a shooting accident on July 16. <b>Whether</b> <b>his</b> death was an accident, suicide, or murder is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially interested in knowing <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E

When {{asked who}} he is {{influenced}} by as Matthew Dear, [...] "Definitely I'm influenced by Brian Eno {{and a lot of}} his work. I've said it before but he is one that is so interesting to listen to on all formats <b>whether</b> it be <b>his</b> production with other bands, <b>whether</b> it's <b>his</b> solo work or <b>whether</b> it's <b>his</b> collaboration work with other artists. He's probably the number one." ...|$|R

5|$|Bohemond added {{a further}} insult to both Alexios and the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1100 when he {{appointed}} Bernard of Valence as the Latin Patriarch, {{and the same}} time expelled the Greek Patriarch, John the Oxite, who fled to Constantinople. Soon after, Bohemond was captured by the Danishmends of Syria and was imprisoned for three years, during which the Antiochenes chose his nephew Tancred as regent. After Bohemond was released, he was defeated by the Seljuks at the Battle of Harran in 1104; this defeat led to renewed pressure on Antioch from both the Seljuks and the Byzantines. Bohemond left Tancred in control of Antioch and returned in the West, touring Italy and France for reinforcements. He won the backing of Pope Paschal II {{and the support of}} the French King Philip I, whose daughter he married. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> expedition qualified as a crusade.|$|E
5|$|Dartnell's {{status as}} a {{professional}} actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> VC was the first awarded to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Dartnell Street in Canberra is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is {{in the collection of}} the Royal Fusiliers headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell's VC and other medals were sold at a Sotheby's auction to Spink & Son for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them off again in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the Australian War Memorial, where they are displayed in the Hall of Valour.|$|E
5|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns usually {{were not}} dated, {{although}} some, concerning {{withdrawal of money}} from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period hatt-ı hümayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially inclined to date his hatt-ı hümayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III {{so that he could}} follow up <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{was while}} Edward was in York that he ordered the {{rehabilitation}} of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him {{for the loss of}} the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.|$|E
5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> wife was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E

50|$|However, {{according}} to Daniel H. Ludlow, {{it is not}} clarified in the Book of Mormon <b>whether</b> Moroni made <b>his</b> abridgment of the record of Ether from Mosiah's earlier translation or <b>whether</b> Moroni took <b>his</b> account directly from the plates of Ether—in which case he would have needed to translate the record as well as abridge it.|$|R
5|$|Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde {{and imprisoned}} in the castle. He {{was accused of}} {{suspicious}} correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would have to support {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, in {{association}} with the Richard III Society, announced that they had joined forces to begin a search for the remains of King Richard. The search for Richard III was led by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking For Richard Project with the archaeological work led by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). Experts set out to locate the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), and to discover <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> remains were still interred there. By comparing fixed points between maps in a historical sequence, the search located the Church of the Grey Friars, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern-day city centre car park.|$|E
5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E

5|$|The Caxias Cabinet {{lasted for}} almost three years, until the Liberals took the reins in January 1878. With the Conservative Party now the opposition, Rio Branco decided to {{undertake}} a one-year tour of Europe, during which he visited most of its countries. He met Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King UmbertoI of Italy, Pope LeoXIII and other leaders during this trip. Rio Branco also visited his eldest son, who was then living in Liverpool as a consul representing Brazil. He did not meet his son's children, {{though it is not}} known whether he refused to meet them or <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> son did not present them. Upon his return to Brazil, Rio Branco was met with huge celebrations in each Brazilian port he visited: in Recife, in his native Salvador, and finally in Rio de Janeiro where he arrived on 30 July 1879.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political and moral objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> governments approved or not.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality was}} very different. Lody's body {{was buried in}} an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with {{seventeen}} other men– ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed out that a licence for exhumation {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E

5|$|This brief account can {{be filled}} out, if Polyaenus's {{account of the}} battle is to be believed. Polyaenus {{collected}} many snippets of information on warfare in his Strategems; some are known from other sources to be reliable, while others are demonstrably false. In the absence of other evidence, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> passage regarding Chaeronea is to be accepted or rejected. Polyaenus suggests that Philip engaged the Greek left, but then withdrew his troops; the Athenians on the Greek left followed and, when Philip held the high ground, he stopped retreating and attacked the Athenians, eventually routing them. In another 'stratagem', Polyaenus suggests that Philip deliberately prolonged the battle, {{to take advantage of}} the rawness of the Athenian troops (his own veterans being more used to fatigue) and delayed his main attack until the Athenians were exhausted. This latter anecdote also appears in the earlier Stratagems of Frontinus.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E
5|$|Ventidius Cumanus (fl. 1st century AD) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c. AD 52. A {{disagreement}} between the surviving sources, the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman Tacitus, makes it unclear <b>whether</b> <b>his</b> authority was over {{some or all}} of the province. Cumanus' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population. Ventidius Cumanus failed to respond to an anti-Jewish murder in Samaritan territory which led to the violent conflict between Jews and Samaritans. Following an investigation by the governor of Syria, Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, Cumanus was sent to Rome for a hearing before the Emperor Claudius, who held him responsible for the violence and sentenced him to exile.|$|E
