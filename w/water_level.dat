5|$|Water {{levels have}} been {{recorded}} since 1875, averaging about 4,200 feet (1,280m) above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> greatly affect {{the extent of the}} shoreline. The <b>water</b> <b>level</b> can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. The <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is also affected by the amount of water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses.

5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

40|$|Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), {{which is}} a measure of {{vegetation}} vigour, and lake <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> respond variably to precipitation and its deficiency. For a given lake catchment, NDVI may have the ability to depict localized natural variability in <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in response to weather patterns.

This study evaluates the potential of using NDVI and its associated derivatives (VCI (vegetation condition index), SVI (standardised vegetation index), AINDVI (annually integrated NDVI), green vegetation function (F g), and NDVIA (NDVI anomaly)) to depict Lake Victoria’s <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> Thirty years of monthly mean <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> and a portion of the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI datasets were used.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Subirrigation applies {{water and}} {{nutrients}} {{to the bottom}} of pots without wetting leaves, improving water use and reducing disease spread compared to overhead irrigation systems. However, <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> applied within the benches are often higher than required to promote capillary action, applying more water than needed and wasting pumping energy. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> on plant growth of subirrigated salvia (Salvia splendens) 'Vista Red' in two substrates. Five <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 75, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 0 cm) and two substrates {pine bark: sphagnum peat moss and peat: perlite (both 75 %: 25 % v/v) } were tested, with four replications. Substrate moisture was monitored by capacitance-type sensors connected to a multiplexer and data logger. Volumetric water content (VWC) was higher in peat: perlite (0. 34 to 0. 75 m 3 /m 3) than pine bark: sphagnum peat moss (0. 21 to 0. 60 m 3 /m 3) at all <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> Higher <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> increased VWC in both substrates. The leaf chlorophyll index was 4 % lower at the 6. 0 cm compared to the other treatments in peat: perlite (p 0. 05), an indication that the different <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> do not affect the plant growth. However, shoot plant height increased 13 % in pine bark: sphagnum peat moss (p= 0. 0096) and 17 % in peat: perlite (p= 0. 0335) as <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> increased. <b>Water</b> <b>levels</b> of 1. 5 cm and higher can be recommended for pine bark: sphagnum peat moss or peat: perlite in subirrigation, applying water according to plant needs, optimizing plant growth and reducing the nutrient solution pumping costs compared to systems that apply higher <b>water</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
