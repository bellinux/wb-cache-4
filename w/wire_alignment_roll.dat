40|$|Modelling dam {{deformation}} {{based on}} monitoring data {{plays an important}} role in the assessment of a dam’s safety. Traditional dam deformation modelling methods generally utilise single monitoring point. It means it is necessary to model for each monitoring point and the spatial correlation between points will not be considered using traditional modelling methods. Spatio-temporal modelling methods provide a way to model the dam deformation with only one functional expression and analyse the stability of dam in its entirety. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical method of blind source separation (BSS) and can separate original signals from mixed observables. In this paper, ICA is introduced as a spatio-temporal modelling method for dam deformation. In this method, the deformation data series of all points were processed using ICA as input signals, and a few output independent signals were used to model. The real data experiment with displacement measurements by <b>wire</b> <b>alignment</b> of Wuqiangxi Dam was conducted and the results show that the output independent signals are correlated with physical responses of causative factors such as temperature and water level respectively. This discovery is beneficial in analysing the dam deformation. In addition, ICA is also an effective dimension reduced method for spatio-temporal modelling in dam deformation analysis applications...|$|R

Methods: Interactive self-ligating brackets with closed and open slides were used for the self-ligating (SL) and conventional ligation (CL) groups, respectively; elastomeric ligatures (1 mm inner diameter) were used in the latter system. The <b>alignment</b> <b>wire</b> used was 0. 014 inch heat-activated NiTi (austenitic finish temperature set at 36 °C by the manufacturer). A custom-made testing machine was used to measure frictional resistance. Tests were repeated 5 times at every angulation simulated. All data were analyzed statistically.

40|$|Stability of {{mechanical}} and electrical offsets of the bpm’s in the LCLS undulator section {{is critical to}} obtaining and maintaining stable FEL lasing. Simulations show that for the LCLS running at 1. 5 Angstroms if the electron beam develops a 2 micron rms deviation from a perfectly straight line over {{a distance of about}} 10 meters, the FEL saturation length will increase by one gain length. [1] Nominally the feedback system will take changes in the electron beam trajectory, measured by the bpm’s, calculate and apply orbit corrections relatively easily. However, the efficacy of this technique relies on the ability of the bpm system to detect real electron beam trajectory changes at the level of 1 micron rms. One source of error in the determination of the electron beam trajectory is through changes in the mechanical or electrical offsets of the bpm’s. Such offset errors are erroneously imposed on the real beam trajectory by the feedback system. Bpm mechanical and electrical offsets can be determined by beam based alignment techniques using electron beams of different energies. However this measurement is time consuming and cannot be used during normal operation. Therefore it is of paramount importance to keep mechanical and electrical offsets as stable as possible — on the scale of a few microns over a period of at least a day.

The systems were compared in terms of relative cost, reliability/simplicity and field capacity. Field capacity computation variables were implement width, implement speed, tower travel speed, implement carrier travel speed, and implement rotation time. The analysis showed the single engine system was the least expensive, simplest system with a field capacity identical {{to that of the}} double engine system, eight percent lower than the double implement system, and approximately thirteen percent higher than the perimeter system.

The evaluation yielded a recommendation that the system be designed to have a tower speed of 48 ft/min, and a rotation time of 7. 5 seconds. A positioning system for the mobile truss of a cable drawn farming system was also developed and tested.

The work output per volume of SMA actuators exceeds that of other microactuation mechanisms, such as electrostatic, magnetic and piezoelectric actuation, by more than an order of magnitude, making SMA actuators highly promising for applications requiring high forces and large displacements. The use of SMAs in MEMS has so far been limited, partially {{due to a lack of}} cost efficient and reliable wafer-level integration approaches. This thesis presents new methods for wafer-level integration of nickel-titanium SMA sheets and wires. For SMA sheets, a technique for the integration of patterned SMA sheets to silicon wafers using gold-silicon eutectic bonding is demonstrated. A method for selective release of gold-silicon eutectically bonded microstructures by localized electrochemical etching, is also presented. For SMA <b>wires,</b> <b>alignment</b> and placement of NiTi wires is demonstrated forboth a manual approach, using specially built wire frame tools, and a semiautomatic approach, using a commercially available wire bonder. Methods for fixing wires to wafers using either polymers, nickel electroplating or mechanical silicon clamps are also shown. Nickel electroplating offers the most promising permanent fixing technique, since both a strong mechanical and good electrical connection to the wire is achieved during the same process step. Resistively heated microactuators are also fabricated by integrating prestrained SMA wires onto silicon cantilevers. These microactuators exhibit displacements that are among the highest yet reported. The actuators also feature a relatively low power consumption and high reliability during longterm cycling. New designs for gas microvalves are presented and valves using both SMA sheets and SMA wires for actuation are fabricated. The SMA-sheet microvalve exhibits a pneumatic performance per footprint area, three times higher than that of previous microvalves. The SMA-wire-actuated microvalve also allows control of high gas flows and in addition, offers benefits of lowvoltage actuation and low overall power consumption. QC 2012051...|$|R

In the past the operator made adjustments to the relative <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rolls</b> in the mill in an attempt to limit the sideways movement of the strip. In order to improve product quality and production throughput, the manual action of adjusting the parallelism of the rolls was replaced with an automatic steering control system.

The control system improved the strip movement by an average of 11 % on various products rolled. Based on production data, the system potentially prevented two coils from leaving the rolls during the month long evaluation period and saved 40 minutes of production time.

Tensioning of NiT i <b>wires,</b> <b>alignment</b> and placement to the wafer ¨is performed using specially built wire fram e tools and a coarse adhesive bonding approach. Anchoring of the wires to the individual devices is demonstrated using two different m ethods: the first method is based on adhesive bond ing of the SMA wires to the array of micromac hined cantilevers using a negative photoresist (SU - 8) and the actuators are operated using an extern al energy source.

In spite of its growing value, the process remains largely un-automated with few principles used in set-up of the rolling mill. This work concentrates on experimental investigations of operating conditions {{in order to gain}} a scientific understanding of the process. The operating conditions are; inter-pass distance, roll load, roll speed, horizontal <b>roll</b> <b>alignment.</b> Fifty tests have been carried out under varied operating conditions, measuring section quality and longitudinal straining to give a picture of bending. A channel section was chosen for its simplicity and compatibility with previous work. Quality measurements were measured in terms of vertical bow, twist and cross-sectional geometric accuracy, and a complete method of classifying quality has been devised. The longitudinal strain profile was recorded, by the use of strain gauges attached to the strip surface at five locations. Parameter control is shown to be important in allowing consistency in section quality. At present rolling mills are constructed with large tolerances on operating conditions. By reduction of the variability in parameters, section consistency is maintained and mill down-time is reduced. <b>Roll</b> load, <b>alignment</b> and differential <b>roll</b> speed are all shown to affect quality, and can be used to control quality. Set-up time is reduced by improving the design of the mill so that parameter values can be measured and set, without the need for judgment by eye. Values of parameters can be guided by models of the process, although elements of experience are still unavoidable. Despite increased parameter control, section quality is variable, if only due to variability in strip material properties. Parameters must therefore be changed during rolling.

[8], some additional factors, including the amount of root resorption along with tooth movement and the intensity of pain experienced by patients during initial alignment, were evaluated. The authors concluded that there is some evidence to suggest that there is no difference between the speed of tooth alignment or pain experienced by patients when using one initial aligning arch wire over another. However, as they report, root resorption had not been investigated by any randomized clinical trial, even though it is one of the most serious side effects of orthodontic treatment. They suggest that further evaluation of the aligning arch wires should consider this potentially serious side effect of orthodontic treatment.|$|R
40|$|A new {{software}} system to test accelerator magnets {{has been developed}} at Fermilab. The magnetic measurement technique involved employs a single stretched <b>wire</b> to measure <b>alignment</b> parameters and magnetic field strength. The software for the system is built {{on top of a}} flexible component-based framework, which allows for easy reconfiguration and runtime modification. Various user interface, data acquisition, analysis, and data persistence components can be configured to form different measurement systems that are tailored to specific requirements (e. g., involving magnet type or test stand). The system can also be configured with various measurement sequences or tests, each of them controlled by a dedicated script. It is capable of working interactively as well as executing a preselected sequence of tests. Each test can be parameterized to fit the specific magnet type or test stand requirements. The system has been designed with portability in mind and is capable of working on various platforms, such as Linux, Solaris, and Windows. It can be configured to use a local data acquisition subsystem or a remote data acquisition computer, such as a VME processor running VxWorks. All hardware-oriented components have been developed with a simulation option that allows for running and testing measurements in the absence of data acquisition hardware...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a novel approach {{for the development of}} 3 D self-assembled polydimethylsiloxane structures, to be used as engineered flexible matrices for bio-hybrid actuation. We described the fabrication of engineered bilayers, organized in a 3 D architecture by means of a stress-induced rolling membrane technique. Such structures were provided with ad hoc surface topographies, for both cell alignment and cell survival after membrane rolling. We reported the results of advanced finite element model simulations, predicting the system behavior in terms of overall contraction, induced by the contractile activity of muscle cells seeded on the membrane. Then, we tested in vitro the structure with primary cardiomyocytes to evaluate the real bio-actuator contraction, thus validating the simulation results. At a later stage, we provided the samples with a stable fibronectin coating, by covalently binding the protein on the polymer surface, thus enabling long-term cultures with C 2 C 12 skeletal muscle cells, a more controllable cell type. These tests revealed cell viability and <b>alignment</b> on the <b>rolled</b> structures, but also the ability of cells to differentiate and to form multinucleated and oriented myotubes on the polymer surface, also supported by a fibroblast feeder layer. Our results highlighted the possibility of developing 3 D rolled PDMS structures, characterized by different mechanical properties, as novel bio-hybrid actuators...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} controlled-potential coulometer {{has been}} developed at the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the determination of plutonium for use at the International Atomic Energy Agency`s (IAEA) Safeguards Analytical Laboratory in Siebersdorf, Austria. The system is functionally the same as earlier systems built for use at the Savannah River Site`s Analytical Laboratory. All electronic circuits and printed circuits boards have been upgraded with state-of-the-art components. A higher amperage potentiostat with improved control stability {{has been developed}}. The system achieves electronic calibration accuracy and linearity of better than 0. 01 percent, with a precision and accuracy better than 0. 1 percent has been demonstrated. This coulometer features electrical calibration of the integration system, electrolysis current background corrections, and control-potential adjustment capabilities. These capabilities allow application of the system to plutonium measurements without chemical standards, achieving traceability to the international measurement system through electrical standards and Faraday`s constant. the chemist is provided with the capability to perform measurements without depending upon chemical standards, which is a significant advantage for applications such as characterization of primary and secondary standards. Additional benefits include reducing operating cost to procure, prepare and measure calibration standards and the corresponding decrease in radioactive waste generation. The design and documentation of the automated instrument are provided herein. Each individual module`s operation, <b>wiring,</b> layout, and <b>alignment</b> are described. Interconnection of the modules and system calibration are discussed. A complete set of prints {{and a list of}} associated parts are included...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of halfway cracks in continuous cast A 36 steel slabs containing 17 ppm boron was studied by investigating the zero ductility temperature (ZDT), zero strength temperature (ZST), solidification characteristics, and strain {{distribution in the}} steels. Results show that the {{formation of}} halfway cracks in A 36 -B slab is attributed {{to the increase in}} both the internal crack susceptibility (ZDT and ZST) of the steel and the external tensile strain at the solidification front. The ZST of both steels with (A 36 -B) and without (A 36) boron addition is nearly the same, but the ZDT of A 36 -B steel is found 50 篊 lower due to a considerable increase of boron content at the final stage of solidification. The decrease of ZDT enlarges the solidification cracking susceptibility zone and results in the A 36 -B steel being more prone to cracking. In addition, during the unbending segments, a large tensile strain, resulting from the unbending process and the misalignment deviation of supporting rolls, occurs in {{the upper part of the}} solidified shell, which is another reason causing halfway cracks in A 36 -B slab. By decreasing the P and S content to be less than 50 ppm and 150 ppm, respectively, controlling B content in the range of 10 to 15 ppm, increasing the secondary cooling specific water ratio from 0. 76 to 0. 85 L穔g- 1, and restricting <b>roll</b> <b>alignment</b> deviation to less than plus or minus 0. 3 mm, halfway cracks in the boron containing slab are almost eliminated...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{arch wire}} {{is the first}} arch wire to be {{inserted}} into the fixed appliance {{at the beginning of}} orthodontic treatment and is used mainly for correcting crowding and rotations of teeth. With a number of orthodontic arch wires available for initial tooth alignment, {{it is important to understand}} which wire is most efficient, as well as which wires cause the least amount of root resorption and pain during the initial aligning stage of treatment. To identify and assess the evidence for the effects of initial arch <b>wires</b> for <b>alignment</b> of teeth with fixed orthodontic braces in relation to alignment speed, root resorption and pain intensity. We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (30 th November 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to 30 th November 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to 30 th November 2009). Reference lists of articles were also searched. There was no restriction with regard to publication status or language of publication. We contacted all authors of included studies to identify additional studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of initial arch wires to align crooked teeth with fixed orthodontic braces were selected. Only studies involving patients with upper and/or lower full arch fixed orthodontic appliances were included. Two review authors were responsible for study selection, validity assessment and data extraction. All disagreements were resolved by discussion amongst the review team. Corresponding authors of included studies were contacted to obtain missing information. Seven RCTs, with 517 participants, provided data for this review. Among them, five trials investigated the speed of initial tooth alignment comparing: 0. 016 inch ion-implanted A-NiTi wire versus 0. 016 inch A-NiTi versus 0. 0175 multistrand stainless steel wire; 0. 016 x 0. 022 inch medium force active M-NiTi wire versus 0. 016 x 0. 022 inch graded force active M-NiTi wire versus 0. 0155 inch multistrand stainless steel wire; 0. 016 inch superelastic NiTi wire versus 0. 016 inch NiTi wire; 0. 014 inch superelastic NiTi wire versus 0. 0155 inch multistrand stainless steel wire; 0. 016 inch CuNiTi wire versus 0. 016 inch NiTi wire. The other two studies investigated pain intensity experienced by patients during the initial stage of treatment comparing: 0. 014 inch superelastic NiTi wire versus 0. 014 inch NiTi wire; 0. 014 inch superelastic NiTi wire versus 0. 015 inch multistrand stainless steel wire. Data analyses were often inappropriate within the included studies. There is some evidence to suggest that there is no difference between the speed of tooth alignment or pain experienced by patients when using one initial aligning arch wire over another. However, in view of the general poor quality of the including trials, these results should be viewed with caution. Further RCTs are required...|$|R
40|$|Gravicentric visual {{alignments}} {{become less}} precise when {{the head is}} roll-tilted relative to gravity, which is most likely due to decreasing otolith sensitivity. To align a luminous line with the perceived gravity vector (gravicentric task) or the perceived body-longitudinal axis (egocentric task), the roll orientation of the line on the retina and the torsional position of the eyes relative to the head must be integrated to obtain the line orientation relative to the head. Whether otolith input contributes to egocentric tasks and whether the modulation of variability is restricted to vision-dependent paradigms is unknown. In nine subjects we compared precision and accuracy of gravicentric and egocentric <b>alignments</b> in various <b>roll</b> positions (upright, 45 °, and 75 ° right-ear down) using a luminous line (visual paradigm) in darkness. Trial-to-trial variability doubled for both egocentric and gravicentric alignments when roll-tilted. Two mechanisms might explain the roll-angle-dependent modulation in egocentric tasks: 1) Modulating variability in estimated ocular torsion, which reflects the roll-dependent precision of otolith signals, affects the precision of estimating the line orientation relative to the head; this hypothesis predicts that variability modulation is restricted to vision-dependent alignments. 2) Estimated body-longitudinal reflects the roll-dependent variability of perceived earth-vertical. Gravicentric cues are thereby integrated regardless of the task's reference frame. To test the two hypotheses the visual paradigm was repeated using a rod instead (haptic paradigm). As with the visual paradigm, precision significantly decreased with increasing head roll for both tasks. These findings propose that the CNS integrates input coded in a gravicentric frame to solve egocentric tasks. In analogy to gravicentric tasks, where trial-to-trial variability is mainly influenced by {{the properties of the}} otolith afferents, egocentric tasks may also integrate otolith input. Such a shared mechanism for both paradigms and frames of reference is supported by the significantly correlated trial-to-trial variabilities...|$|R
