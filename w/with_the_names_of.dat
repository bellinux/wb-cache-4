5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became evident that the soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost.

A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts.

5|$|In 1666 as the Great Fire of London {{swept through}} the city, Derby Place, the College's home since 1555, was {{completely}} gutted and destroyed.

5|$|In April {{and early}} May, ethnic {{tensions}} in Zadar and northern Dalmatia escalated after increased sabotage activities targeting communications, the power distribution grid and other property.

The news incited riots in Zadar that day, with crowds marching through the city centre demanding weapons to confront the Croatian Serbs and smashing the windows of shops owned by Serbian companies and Serbs living in the city. Croat-owned businesses in Knin were destroyed in retaliation during the night of 7–8 May.
