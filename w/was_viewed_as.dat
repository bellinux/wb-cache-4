The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{too old and}} {{out of touch with}} the players.|$|E

Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

30|$|For the {{state-dependent}} relay channel with orthogonal components {{considered in}} this paper, the channel states SR and SD <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the signals of corresponding primary communication; {{the source and}} the relay <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the secondary users which are capable of acquiring the channel state information. Thus, the model studied in this paper can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a secondary relay communication with cognitive source and cognitive relay.

50|$|In {{digital signal}} processing, linear {{prediction}} {{is often called}} linear predictive coding (LPC) and can thus <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a subset of filter theory.

50|$|Stealth taxes can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> regressive, as more {{affluent}} people are less affected by VAT, for example.

5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East.

Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight.

5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a desertion of his duties. Historians {{in the 21st century}} see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education.

With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
