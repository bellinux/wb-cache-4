25|$|A walker or <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> or Rollator is a {{tool for}} {{disabled}} people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker {{may or may not}} have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.|$|E
500|$|Late 20th {{and early}} 21st-century fashion {{designers}} such as Alexander McQueen and John Galliano often used crinolines in their designs, with the skirt {{of one of}} Galliano's ballgowns for Dior in 1998 reaching a width of 9 feet. Galliano specifically visited the original crinoline manufacturers that Christian Dior himself had used in order to inform and influence his own designs. McQueen {{was fascinated by the}} crinoline and often referenced it in his collections, cutting away leather ballgowns to reveal the cage beneath, or making it out of silver-decorated cut metal. [...] One of McQueen's most notable crinoline designs was modelled by the amputee model Aimee Mullins in a series of photographs by Nick Knight for Dazed and Confused, in which Mullin's cage crinoline, deliberately worn without overskirts in order to reveal her prosthetic legs, was described as suggesting both a <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> and a cage to [...] "contain the unruliness of the unwhole". The images from this shoot were declared among the most significant commercial images of 1998, representing Knight and McQueen's dedication to presenting alternatives to the traditional concepts of fashion and physical beauty. After McQueen's death in 2010, his successor, Sarah Burton, continued the tradition of designing crinolines for the McQueen brand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{population}} ageing, {{the number of}} people that depend on mobility aids, such as <b>walking</b> <b>frames,</b> mobility scooters, or wheel chairs, will increase steadily over the next decades. In order to support the physical impaired outside traffic participants, barrier-free navigation and trip planning solutions have been developed. In this work, we go beyond these approaches and investigate potential benefits arising from the integration of mobility aids in vehicle-to-x communication. We argue that this can lead to increased safety for all traffic participants as well as to a more efficient mobility for the physically impaired people as individual requirements can be met. I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Independent mobility is a key aspect for self-determined living and social inclusion. However, with the demographic change leading towards population ageing, more and mor...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an exploratory study {{performed in the}} context of the assistive products for walking. The aim was to verify the applicability of design strategies to increase the users' perceived value via the offer of controlled levels customization. For that, lean principle of standardization and the taxonomy of customization levels from the mass customization approaches guided this study. These concepts focused the research into design patterns identification, allowing the use of combinatorial modularization. The efforts consisted in a technologic research made in Abledata and Assisdata AT databases, which resulted in a selection of 200 walking aids and accessories. After, their features were analyzed, with special attention to the products architecture. The investigation concluded that assistive products for walking are able to incorporate high levels of product customization. This may be implemented by the design of a flexible modular product body configurable in different ways. Thus, the product differentiation between canes, crutches and <b>walking</b> <b>frames,</b> for example, will be done by an adaptable body and the respective accessories to complete the product structure...|$|R

40|$|Background: Women {{with disabilities}} in Zimbabwe face {{numerous}} challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health. Cultural belief still regards them as not sexually active. The government has also failed to promote policies that facilitate access to sexual and reproductive services by women with disabilities. Objectives: The reseach objectives were to explore the challenges faced by women {{with disabilities in}} accessing sexual and reproductive health in Zimbabwe. Method: The data were gathered using in-depth interviews with 23 purposively selected respondents. Thirteen women had physical disabilities, five were visually impaired, three were deaf and two were stammering. The respondents with physical disabilities were using wheelchairs, <b>walking</b> <b>frames,</b> prosthesis, crutches and caliper shoes. The participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 45 years. All interviews were transcribed and translated verbatim into English, and passages were extracted from the transcripts. Key themes and concepts were identified and coded to offer a rich framework for analysis, comparisons and presentation of the data. Results: Negative perceptions of health personnel towards people with disabilities, disability-unfriendly infrastructure at health facilities and absence of trained personnel {{for people with disabilities}} (sign language) are some of the challenges involved. Conclusion: The government, in partnership with other stakeholders, should address challenges faced by women with disabilities when accessing sexual and reproductive health services. Non-government, private hospitals and profit-making organisations should join hands with government in funding health requirements for women with disabilities...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{hearing aid}} fitting {{occurs when the}} person fitted wears the aid/s {{on a regular basis}} and reports benefit when the aid/s is used. A {{significant}} number of people fitted with unilateral or bilateral hearing aids for the first time do not continue to use one or both aids in the long term. In this paper, factors consistently found in previous research to be associated with unsuccessful fitting are explored; in particular, the negative attitudes of some clients towards hearing aids, their lack of motivation for seeking help, inability to identify goals for rehabilitation, and problems with the management of the devices. It is argued here that success in hearing aid fitting involves the same dynamics as found with other assistive technologies (e. g., wheelchairs, <b>walking</b> <b>frames),</b> and is dependent on a match between the characteristics of a prospective user, the technology itself, and the environments of use (Scherer, 2002). It is recommended that for clients who identify concerns about hearing aids, or who are unsure about when they would use them, and/or are likely to have problems with aid management, only one aid be fitted in the first instance, if hearing aid fitting is to proceed at all. Rehabilitation approaches to promote successful fitting are discussed in light of results obtained from a survey of clients who experienced both successful and unsuccessful aid fitting...|$|R
