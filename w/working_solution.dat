25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a <b>working</b> <b>solution</b> for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E

30|$|All {{chemicals}} {{used in this}} study were of analytical grade. Deionised water was used to prepare solutions of different concentrations. A stock standard copper solution of 1000  mg/L was prepared by dissolving an appropriate quantity of copper in a 1 -L volumetric flask and making to the mark with deionised water. The <b>working</b> <b>solutions</b> were prepared by diluting the stock solution with deionized water to give the required concentrations of the <b>working</b> <b>solutions.</b> Six different concentrations of the adsorbate were prepared as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60  ppm.|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, Dorothy is swept from her farm to Oz by a cyclone, which was frequently compared to the Free Silver movement in Baum's time. The yellow brick road represents the gold standard, and the Silver Shoes, which enable Dorothy to travel more comfortably, symbolizes the Populist Party's desire to construct a bimetallic standard of both gold and silver in place of the gold standard. [...] "Oz" [...] is the abbreviated form of ounce, a standard measure of gold. When Dorothy and the Scarecrow walk through the forest, the road begins to be rough and patchy, causing the Scarecrow to trip and fall numerous times. The Scarecrow's falls on the yellow brick road resemble the damage farmers faced owing to deflation caused by the scarcity of gold. Dorothy, however, simply [...] "walks around" [...] the holes in the road, showing that the bimetallic standard works. Even when gold was scarce, the other metal in the bimetal system would be relatively cheap, therefore one bypasses deflation. Throughout the book, most of the characters do not know the magic behind the silver shoes. It is not until Dorothy meets Glinda, the good Witch of the South, that she finds out that the silver shoes have had the power to transfer her back to Kansas all along. Baum is possibly alluding {{to the fact that the}} bimetallic standard has been a <b>working</b> <b>solution</b> to the economic crisis all along, though no one knows how to do it. Once Dorothy clicks her heels three times, she returns to Kansas, where she realizes that [...] "The Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert." [...] The silver shoes were lost, much like the fight for the bimetallic standard, which began to fade away in 1900.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{since our}} {{imaginary}} New Republic, {{which is to}} set itself to {{the making of a}} better generation of men, will find the possibility of improving the race by selective breeding too remote for anything but further organised inquiry, it is evident that its first point of attack will have to be the wastage of such births as the world gets to-day.

Upon the theory of New Republicanism as it was discussed in our first paper an effective solution (effective enough, let us say, to abolish seventy or eighty per cent.) of this scandal of infantile suffering would have precedence over almost every existing political consideration.|$|E
