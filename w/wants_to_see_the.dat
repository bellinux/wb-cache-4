5|$|Villagers {{gathered}} around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster (Boris Karloff). Their joy is tempered by the realization that Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead. Hans (Reginald Barlow), father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster– having survived the fire– strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and {{is a story of}} how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, {{a number}} of female authors have risen to prominence, {{including}} Alison Tyler, Rachel Kramer Bussel and Carol Queen. Janine Ashbless, Kristina Lloyd, and Portia da Costa are well known for their erotic novels and short stories. Kristina Wright {{is well known for}} her bestselling genre themed anthologies through Cleis Press, including steampunk erotica, paranormal erotic romance, and fairy tale erotica, exemplified by authors such as Shanna Germain and Michelle Augello-Page. Mitzi Szereto is an editor and author who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> term 'erotica' removed from novels and anthologies that include depictions of sexual activities. Other authors celebrate the term 'erotica' but also question why literature 'with the sex left in' should be considered outside literary fiction.|$|E
500|$|A live-action {{version of}} Ariel {{appeared}} in the ABC television series Once Upon a Time, where she was played by JoAnna Garcia. Showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz had wanted to introduce the character for a while but saved her for season three when the show's setting temporarily moved to the fictional Neverland, a land with mermaids. Ariel's highly anticipated appearance was announced with a teaser trailer at the show's panel at the San Diego Comic-con on July 20, 2013, during the hiatus between {{the second and third}} seasons. The showrunners provided their own [...] "spin" [...] on the character of Ariel for the show, but maintained her spirit as someone [...] "who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world and who wants to experience things outside of what they know". In portraying the role, García had to film scenes swimming in the cold ocean water of Vancouver with her legs bound, which was additionally challenging since it was her first role after giving birth. Ariel's main arc took place over several episodes of the 2013-2014 third season, and she later appeared in one episode each of the fourth and sixth seasons.|$|E

500|$|It is {{time for}} farewells, with the Stark family having to split apart. Ned's two daughters journey with their father to the capital. Jon Snow {{journeys}} to join his uncle Benjen {{as a man of}} the Night's Watch at the Wall. Tyrion, who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> [...] "edge of the world", accompanies them. Before leaving, Jon gives a sword to his sister Arya as a present. Lady Catelyn Stark is devastated by her husband's imminent departure and has stood vigil beside her son Bran since his fall. Having always deeply resented Jon, Catelyn asks him to leave when he comes to say goodbye to Bran and then chastises her husband Ned for leaving her and giving in to the demands of King Robert. Before they part, Jon asks Ned about his mother, and Ned promises to tell Jon about her the next time they meet. While stopping for a meal, Robert tells Ned that he has received word about Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo and voices concern about the possibility of Viserys crossing the Narrow Sea with a Dothraki army to overthrow him with help from those in the Seven Kingdoms who still support the Targaryens' claim to the throne and think of Robert as a usurper.|$|E
500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving {{at the speed of}} innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and I love the idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

2500|$|June 15, 2005 - It is {{appearing}} {{less likely}} {{the bill will}} be out of 3rd reading stage by the time MPs recess from the summer on June 23 (unless sittings area extended) due to Conservatives stalling the budget bill (C-48), and the Government wants to deal with C-48 before C-38. The Government can invoke closure and force a vote on C-38 immediately, but it seems unlikely to happen since even the Liberal Government has disgruntled MPs against C-38 [...] that want more debate now that the committee has reported. Weeks ago, Pat O'Brien left the Liberal caucus over the same-sex marriage legislation, that he felt was being rushed through the Commons.
