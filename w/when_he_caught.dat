5|$|In {{the season}} opener, the Wolverines played the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium. The Wolverines scored first, {{midway through the}} first quarter, with a 27-yard {{touchdown}} (TD) pass from Tate Forcier to Junior Hemingway. They added to their lead five minutes later when Denard Robinson ran in a TD from 43 yards out. In the second quarter, Michigan added 17 more points: two TDs and a field goal. First was a 7-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier to Kevin Koger. 6 minutes later, Jason Olesnavage kicked a 44-yard field goal. Junior Hemingway scored Michigan's final points <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> a 44-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier, putting the Wolverines up 31–0 at halftime.

5|$|Leading all Tech {{receivers}} was Josh Morgan, {{who caught}} eight passes for 55yards and a touchdown. Eddie Royal {{also had an}} excellent game for the Hokies, catching twolong passes of 18yards and 11yards on subsequent plays in the second quarter. Royal's 2catches drove the Hokies deep into Boston College territory, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman that tied the game at halftime. Royal's biggest play, however, came halfway through the fourth quarter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> the go-ahead touchdown pass from Sean Glennon. The 24-yard reception was Royal's longest catch of the day, and the touchdown gave the Hokies a lead they would not relinquish {{for the rest of}} the game.|$|E

Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor. Dickov joined the youth ranks of Arsenal in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under George Graham chances were limited for Dickov {{as he struggled to}} break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as Ian Wright. He helped the club win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994, and beforehand he {{had been a member of}} Arsenal's squad during its first season in the Premier League.

5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

During the EuroBasket 2007, Parker averaged 20.1 points per game and 2.8 assists per game in nine tournament games, but France was defeated in the quarter-finals by the Russian national team. He passed the 2010 FIBA World Championship to recover fully from some injuries he had during the 2009–10 NBA season. Parker returned to the team in 2011, and France reached the finals of the 2011 EuroBasket, losing to Spain. Parker also joined the team for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In 2013, Parker and the French national team won the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket tournament.|$|E

5|$|Born in England, Brooks {{emigrated to}} Australia {{as a toddler}} and started {{swimming}} lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, {{but it was not}} until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4100m medley relay, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.|$|E
5|$|Roundtree redshirted for the 2008 season. He {{made his}} college debut on September 5, 2009 against the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium as a slot receiver. That year, he roomed with Trotwood {{teammates}} Shaw and Moore. He had just two receptions {{in the first}} eight {{games of the season}} while playing as a backup. He became a starter for the team's final four games, and finished as the leading receiver for the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team in terms of both yards and receptions per game, despite the limited playing time. One of the two early-season receptions occurred on October 3 against Michigan State in the Paul Bunyan Trophy game <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> the game-tying touchdown with two seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. He made his first start on October 31 against the Illinois Fighting Illini as a slot receiver. On November 7, against Purdue he had ten receptions for 126 yards. He also had nine receptions for 116 yards in the November 21, 2009 game against the rival Ohio State Buckeyes. Following the season, he was named a CollegeFootballNews.com Freshman All-America honorable mention, and a Sporting News Freshman All-Big Ten selection.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his third pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, with a time of 1:18.439. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard who qualified 0.098 seconds behind Michael Schumacher's time having battled the Ferrari driver for grid position throughout the session. Barrichello qualified in 3rd position and was happy with his Ferrari. Häkkinen encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and managed fourth. Frentzen, who qualified 5th, had to overcome heavy gusts at the L'Epingle hairpin where he found it difficult to find his braking spot. Villeneuve was sixth with teammate Zonta in eighth. Trulli split them for seventh position. Pedro de la Rosa in an Arrows car and Fisichella completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two hundredths of a second though {{he said that he was}} happy with his car. Ralf Schumacher set the 12th quickest time despite his Williams suffering a lack of mechanical grip. He was ahead of Verstappen who crashed his car at turn 4 which caused a temporary suspension to qualifying. The resultant damage caused him to use his team's spare monocoque. Wurz, in the second Benetton, lost time <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> the aftermath of Verstappen's collision and was 14th fastest. Salo battled with his rear wheel locking on downshifts and took 15th. He started in front of Irvine in the slower of the two Jaguars. Jean Alesi's Prost qualified 17th despite an engine failure, ahead of Button and Diniz. The Minardi drivers qualified at the back of the grid, covering positions 20 to 22 with Heidfeld splitting them for 21st.|$|E

5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was a six-yard run by Linton, and it was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler. Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> a short pass for a first down from Keldorf. Now at the Hokies' 31, Linton ran straight ahead for a two-yard gain. Linton's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf, but rather than punt, the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down. The fourth-down pass fell incomplete, and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30-yard line. Clark completed a six-yard pass to Parker, then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the clock. On third down, Clark completed a nine-yard pass to Michael Stuewe for a first down. A first-down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense, but on second down, Clark completed a pass to Stuewe for a first down at the Tar Heels 40-yard line. After a deep pass went incomplete, Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball {{for the second time in}} the first half. The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field. North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into scoring position before the end of the half, but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 220 lead.|$|E
