5|$|Clemson's offense {{returned}} to the field at its 35-yard line after Georgia Tech's kickoff and a 30-yard return by C. J. Spiller. During the ensuing drive, Spiller <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> player for the Tigers. On five consecutive plays, he received the ball during rushing plays. He gained 3, 13, 6, 2, and 41 yards, respectively, {{on each of these}} plays en route to the end zone and a touchdown. Clemson attempted a two-point conversion, but the try failed and the Tigers simply tied the Yellow Jackets, 13–13.|$|E

Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|In June 1776, American Patriot {{officers}} Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, William Heath, and Israel Putnam {{examined the}} terrain on which Fort Washington would be located; {{they agreed that}} if the fort was properly fortified, it would be practically impossible to take. Later in June, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, inspected the location and determined that the area <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to defense of the lower Hudson.

5|$|On offense, the Jayhawks {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 344yards, 249of which came through the air. Quarterback Todd Reesing <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> contributor to the Kansas aerial attack, completing 20of his 37passes for 227yards and just one interception. The only other Kansas player to record passing yards was running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw a 22-yard first-down pass during a fake punt. Though under pressure {{for much of the}} game—Reesing was sacked four times—Kansas continued to maintain an effective pass attack throughout the game.|$|E

By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the success of the American dream.|$|E

5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Following Stanford's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field at its 25-yard line and {{embarked}} upon one of its longest drives {{of the game in}} terms of the number of plays. In the first seven plays of the drive, quarterback Taylor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> component. He threw six passes, completing 3 for 39yards, and ran once, for no gain. On the eighth play of the drive, running back Ryan Williams gained one yard, then committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. Tech's drive faltered after the penalty: Taylor threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a 16-yard loss, and the Hokies punted to the Stanford 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of his navy at Salamis, Xerxes retreated to Asia with {{the bulk of his}} army. According to Herodotus, this was because he feared the Greeks would sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges, thereby {{trapping}} his army in Europe. He left Mardonius, with handpicked troops, to complete the conquest of Greece the following year. Mardonius evacuated Attica and wintered in Thessaly; the Athenians then reoccupied their destroyed city. Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension among the Allies. The Athenians in particular, who were not protected by the Isthmus but whose fleet <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the security of the Peloponnese, felt hard done by and demanded that an Allied army march north the following year. When the Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, stationed itself off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet remained off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|Home Rule <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{issue in}} British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there was}} some tension among the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the Isthmus, but whose fleet <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{to the security of}} the Peloponnesus, felt that they had been treated unfairly, and so they refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus. Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace to the Athenians, using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediate. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the Persians' offer. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if they were not aided. In response, the Spartans summoned a large army from the Peloponnese cities and marched to meet the Persians.|$|E

Kratos rescued Pandora after he learned that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to pacifying the Flame of Olympus that surrounded Pandora's Box. Kratos reluctantly allowed Pandora to sacrifice herself to open the Box and mourned her death, as Pandora {{reminded him of his}} deceased child Calliope. Pandora reappeared in Kratos' psyche and helped him find the power of hope locked deep inside himself, which allowed him to overcome and kill Zeus. The character was voiced by Natalie Lander in God of War III.|$|E

5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
5|$|The moral {{defense of}} the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an {{argument}} that they saved lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded {{that the effects of}} strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian Barrett Tillman has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their bombsight and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.|$|E
