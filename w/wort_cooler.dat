50|$|Cold liquor {{tanks are}} used for brewing process and CLT’s also called buffer tanks. Buffer tanks contain cold water used {{for the purpose of}} cooling the bitter wort {{temperature}} down to the fermentable level range after boiling. This process is done by <b>wort</b> <b>cooler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Smaller breweries often {{served a}} local area. The {{appearance}} of the brewery, especially when tall, was often a major advertising site. Some tower breweries were bluff brick-faced towers but many were highly distinctive and used architectural whimsy to make them distinctive. Brewing was a profitable business and brewers could afford to indulge their architects with details such as Mock Tudor half-timbering and polychrome brick. The timbered architecture was encouraged by the necessary timber louvres forming the upper story of the tower around the <b>wort</b> <b>cooler.</b> Roof shape was often complicated, with many sections of hipped roof and triangular dormers.|$|E
50|$|Immersion {{chillers}} work by circulating {{a cooling}} fluid (usually tap {{water from a}} garden hose or faucet) through a copper/stainless steel coil that is placed directly in the hot <b>wort.</b> As the <b>cooling</b> fluid runs through the coil it absorbs and carries away heat until the <b>wort</b> has <b>cooled</b> to the desired temperature.|$|R
50|$|A {{coolship}} (Anglicized {{version of}} the Dutch/Flemish koelschip) {{is a type of}} fermentation vessel used in the production of beer. Traditionally, a coolship is a broad, open-top, flat vessel in which <b>wort</b> <b>cools.</b> The high surface to mass ratio allows for more efficient cooling. Contemporary usage includes any open fermentor used in the production of beer, even when using modern mechanical cooling techniques. Traditionally, coolships were constructed of wood, but later were lined with iron or copper for better thermal conductivity.|$|R
50|$|Millet kernels are {{soaked in}} warm water until they sprout, with the goal to {{increase}} the content of maltose in the grain. The millet is then dried out to arrest the germination process. The malted grain is then pulverized and mixed with water. This mixture {{is commonly known as}} wort. The wort is later boiled in order to remove any potential bacterial threat. Once the boiling process is complete and the <b>wort</b> <b>cools</b> down yeast is added. The mixture is then allowed to ferment. The entire process takes five days.|$|R
50|$|While boiling, it {{is useful}} to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which {{unheated}} water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary. Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the <b>wort</b> <b>cooling.</b> When cold water is used to <b>cool</b> the <b>wort</b> in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.|$|R
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The <b>wort</b> is <b>cooled</b> overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the <b>wort.</b> While this <b>cooling</b> method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|R
50|$|Fermenting - The <b>cooled</b> <b>wort</b> is {{saturated}} with air, and yeast is {{added in the}} fermentation tank. Different strains of yeast will create different styles of beer. This step takes around ten days.|$|R
5|$|After boiling, the hopped <b>wort</b> is now <b>cooled,</b> {{ready for}} the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped <b>wort</b> is simply <b>cooled</b> for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|R
50|$|Fermentation {{takes place}} in {{fermentation}} vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats. After the <b>wort</b> is <b>cooled</b> and aerated - usually with sterile air - yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the malt are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the product can be called beer for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} boiling, the hot <b>wort</b> {{is quickly}} <b>cooled</b> (in homebrewing, often using an {{immersion}} chiller) to a temperature favourable to the yeast. Once sufficiently cooled, the yeast is added, or [...] "pitched", to begin the fermentation process.|$|R
5000|$|Aroma hops are {{typically}} {{added to the}} wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart [...] "hop taste" [...] (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or [...] "hop aroma" [...] (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). Aroma hops are often added after the <b>wort</b> has <b>cooled</b> and while the beer ferments, a technique known as [...] "dry hopping", which contributes to the hop aroma. Farnesene is a major component in some hops. The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavor and aroma.|$|R
500|$|After the boil, the <b>wort</b> was <b>cooled</b> and {{fermented}} in open wooden vats at [...] [...] The two {{strains of}} yeast were added at the same time, and fermentation would proceed rapidly. [...] After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed {{on the top of}} the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse. [...] The beer was then pumped with sterile air into clarification tanks. [...] Isinglass was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.|$|R

40|$|Microorganisms {{are able}} to spoil foods with their {{presence}} in food plants, therefore, there is necessary to perform the monitoring of microbial air quality. The aim of this Bachelor thesis was {{to confirm that the}} air quality in the food plant is better than in the current environment. Microbial cleanliness should be at the highest level, especially in places where is risk of contamination of the products. Air composition was observed in microbrewery by Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. It was evaluated {{by the total number of}} microorganisms and number of moulds. In the case of moulds there was also determined gender representation. Samples of air with present microorganisms were collected from five parts of the brewery, using active air intake with airsampler MAS 100 Eco (Merck, Germany). It was a sanitation station, lager beer cellar, section <b>wort</b> <b>cooling,</b> boiling room and to compare the hall. Air analysis was performed twice with intervals of two months. According to the findings, in sanitation station can be found higher total number of microorganisms than in the hall. However, this increased incidence could be related to microbial penetration from the outside environment due to the use of makeshift door leading into the room. In other parts of the operation has already been confirmed less than the total number of microorganisms in the hall. Enumeration of molds revealed that the entire operation were lower than the concentrations of these microbes in the corridor. Dangerous place in the brewery in terms of contamination of the product is lager cellar, because here with maturation occurs also his tapping. Here upheld a lower incidence of microorganisms than in the current environment, and as other parts of the plant do not pose a risk of product degradation, the objective has been achieved. Of the native representation of mould in the air microbrewery it shows that the most abundant mould genus was Cladosporium and Penicillium followed. Cladosporium occupied on average 54, 8 % of the total number of mould. At lower concentrations, there have been also genera Alternaria and Aspergillus...|$|R

50|$|A Yorkshire Square vessel is a two-storey system {{consisting}} of a shallow chamber approximately two metres high, above which is a walled deck. <b>Cooled</b> <b>wort,</b> the liquid extracted from malted barley, is fermented in the lower chamber, while the yeasty head settles on the deck above. During {{the first stage of}} fermentation, the fermenting wort is periodically pumped {{from the bottom of the}} chamber over the yeasty head, to keep the yeast mixed in with the wort. Later, the mixing is stopped and the wort in the chamber allowed to settle and cool gently. Most of the yeast rises onto the deck, and is left behind when the beer is drained from the chamber. The whole process takes at least six days. However, beer straight from a Yorkshire Square vessel will still have a harsh flavour, so the residual yeast is allowed to ferment any remaining sugar, producing a little extra alcohol and carbon dioxide, which mellows the beer. This conditioning begins in tanks at the brewery and continues after the beer is filled into casks, hence the phrase 'Cask Conditioned'.|$|R
40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a {{contaminant}} {{of grain}} and fruit and {{has one of}} the highest levels of carcinogenicity of any natural toxin. AFB 1 and the fungi that produce it can also contaminate the raw materials used for beer and wine manufacture, such as corn and grapes. Therefore, brewers must ensure strict monitoring to reduce the risk of contamination. In this study, the fate of AFB 1 during the fermentation process was investigated using laboratory-scale bottom and top beer fermentation and wine fermentation. During fermentation, <b>cool</b> <b>wort</b> beer samples and wine must samples were artificially spiked with AFB 1 and the levels of AFB 1 remaining after fermentation were analyzed. AFB 1 levels were unchanged during both types of fermentation used for beer but were reduced to 30 % of their initial concentration in wine. Differential analysis of the spiked and unspiked wine samples showed that the degradation compound was AFB 2 a, a hydrated derivative of AFB 1. Thus, the results showed that the risk of AFB 1 carryover was still present for both types of beer fermentation but was reduced in the case of wine fermentation because of hydration...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic amines are biomolecules {{synthesized}} by eukaryotic and prokaryotic {{cells that}} can affect human health. Histamine and tyramine {{are the most important}} and can cause important troubles like headache and severe forms of allergy. Secondary biogenic amines can also be involved in the synthesis of nitrosamines in the stomach. In beer, the presence of biogenic amines is mainly due to the activity of contaminants that develop during fermentation but their synthesis was detected during malting too. The microorganisms involved are the Enterobacteria sp., possibly active at the early stage of the fermentation, and many lactic acid bacteria. Some strains of S. cerevisiae produce different biogenic amines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine mainly. Some speciality beers such as sour beers and beers produced by mixed cultures are characterized by a constitutive presence of biogenic amines due to the metabolism of the typical microflora involved. This paper demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} reduce the level of the biogenic amines significantly (up to 95 %) in speciality beers by keeping the process as traditional as possible.

5000|$|There {{have been}} various {{explanations}} {{for the use of}} the name [...] "steam beer". According to Anchor Brewing, the name [...] "steam" [...] came from the fact that the brewery had no way to effectively chill the boiling wort using traditional means. So they pumped the hot wort up to large, shallow, open-top bins on the roof of the brewery so that it would be rapidly chilled by the cool air blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. Thus while brewing, the brewery had a distinct cloud of steam around the roof let off by the <b>wort</b> as it <b>cooled,</b> hence the name. Another explanation is that the carbon dioxide pressure produced by the 19th-century steam-beer-making process was very high, and that it may have been necessary as part of the process to let off [...] "steam" [...] before attempting to dispense the beer. It is also possible that the name or brewing process derive from Dampfbier (literally steam beer), a traditional German beer that was also fermented at unusually high temperatures and that may have been known to 19th-century American brewers, many of whom were of German descent; Dampfbier is an ale, however, not a lager.|$|R

50|$|Fermentation {{begins as}} soon as yeast {{is added to the}} <b>cooled</b> <b>wort.</b> This is also {{the point at which the}} product is first called beer. It is during this stage that {{fermentable}} sugars won from the malt (maltose, maltotriose, glucose, fructose and sucrose) are metabolized into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation tanks come in many shapes and sizes, from enormous cylindroconical vessels that can look like storage silos, to five-gallon glass carboys used by homebrewers. Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels (CCVs), which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's aperture is typically around 70°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow smoothly out through the cone's apex at the end of fermentation, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out through a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, making it easy to harvest top-fermenting yeasts. The open tops of the vessels increase the risk of contamination, but proper cleaning procedures help to control the risk.|$|R
5000|$|After the whirlpool, the wort {{is drawn}} {{away from the}} {{compacted}} hop trub, and rapidly cooled via a heat exchanger to a temperature where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or glycol run in channels {{in the opposite direction}} of the wort, causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to quickly <b>cool</b> the <b>wort</b> to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above [...] After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the <b>cooled</b> <b>wort</b> goes into a fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or [...] "pitched", to the fermentation tank. When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other components. When the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. [...] Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer may be filtered and force carbonated for bottling, or fined in the cask.|$|R
50|$|Barley is {{soaked in}} {{water from the}} source {{for two to three}} days then spread over the floor of the malting house. The green malt is then dried in a kiln over peat smoke. The malt is then milled into grist, which is like a coarse flour. Grist is then mixed with hot water in the mash tun at about 70 °C for about an hour. This is drained off and the second water, which is hotter, is added and allowed to run {{straight}} through. The third water is even hotter and is used as the first water for the next batch. The sugary <b>wort</b> is collected, <b>cooled</b> and then fermented in large pine vessels called wash backs. Yeast is added and after 48 hours of fermentation the wash is made. The wash is then pre-heated in a wash-charger and from there goes to the wash still. This is a traditional pot still made of copper and is of a shape unchanged in the history of Scotch whisky making. The wash is heated in the pot still so the alcohol vapour rises up and cools and condenses in the low wines receiver. The low wines then passes through to the spirit still where it is distilled again. The spirit running through the pot and spirit stills is subject to Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Duty and so is kept under lock and key. It can be sampled and tested by the stillman via the spirit sample safe. The spirit from the spirit still is divided in three parts, but only the middle cut or “Heart of the Run” is suitable to be made into malt whisky. The other two parts are fed back into the low wines receiver to be re-distilled. The middle cut then goes to an oak spirit receiver and from there to the filling vats in the spirit store.|$|R
