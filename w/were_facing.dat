5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E

5|$|Back at {{the regular}} front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to {{increase}} their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau to make the Italians believe that they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> superior forces. They used shoot-and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire and leaving the Italians {{with the impression that}} they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> multiple consistent points of fire. In response, the General Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison. The Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and were heading southeast to cut the Saïo-Yubdo road. By {{the end of the month}} the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo and make a final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF further complicated their situation.|$|E
5|$|The pie {{originates}} {{from the}} fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with {{many parts of}} Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the pie is served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning {{that none of the}} fishing boats had been able to leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> starvation.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that}} the government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within {{a few months after the}} storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County, {{they took the}} lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the League five times, and by 1982 they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> a financial crisis which they survived thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the highest position they achieved in the Football League since {{the introduction of the}} four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Allen {{began the}} {{season on the}} {{practice}} squad while he recovered from a knee injury, but he replaced Doug Hocking as a starter in Week 3. By late August, the Lions <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> the return of several key import players, including Stewart Hill and Lee Johnson. To meet CFL import ratio requirements, which require each team to field {{a certain number of}} Canadian players, the Lions replaced Allen again with Hocking. Allen's season was hampered both by his early injury and import ratio troubles, limiting him to three games in which he recorded 13 tackles. While on the practice squad, the Calgary Stampeders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts tried to recruit him, but he declined to leave the Lions.|$|E
5|$|Leeds City had {{finished}} 19th in the Second Division {{in the season}} preceding Chapman's arrival, and <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> re-election. Chapman played an essential part in lobbying for the side's readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected. That done, Chapman signed new talent such as Jimmy Speirs from Bradford City and despite some erratic performances – losing 6–0 in between two 5–1 wins, for example – City finished sixth in 1912–13, Chapman's first season. Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8,500 to 13,000 in his first year, as Chapman's attacking side scored 70goals, the second-highest total in the entire division.|$|E

5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
5|$|Sterling Products, {{equipped}} {{with all of}} Bayer's U.S. intellectual property, tried {{to take advantage of}} its new brand as quickly as possible, before generic ASAs took over. However, without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals, they had only a finite aspirin supply and <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> competition from other companies. Sterling president William E. Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin not only in the U.S., but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well. Taking advantage of the losses Farbenfabriken Bayer (the German Bayer company) suffered through the reparation provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share profits in the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs, in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{advanced}} to the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, whom they defeated four games to three. While the Cardinals <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> the Dodgers, the Red Sox faced a team of American League All-Stars in an exhibition match. During the game, Ted Williams injured his elbow. He recovered in time {{to play in the}} World Series, but manager Joe Cronin blamed the injury on having to wait for the three-game series to finish, and pushed for future tie-breakers to be a single game. Cronin got his wish in the American League, as the 1948 American League tie-breaker was only a one-game matchup. However, the National League hosted three more series-style tie-breakers in later seasons before converting to a single-game format.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{were under}} the {{impression}} that they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May, French morale was low. They had {{suffered}} terrible losses at Ostrach and Stockach, although these {{had been made}} up by reinforcements. Two senior officers of the Army of the Danube, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen and Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> courts-martial on charges of misconduct, professed by their senior officer, Jourdan. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr were sick, or claimed they were, and had left the army's encampments to recover their health. Masséna's force had been repelled by Hotze's army at Feldkirch, and forced to fall back, and LeCourbe's failure to push through against Bellegarde's Austrian force in the Tyrol, meant Masséna had to pull his southern wing back {{as well as his}} center and northern wing, to maintain communication with the retreating armies on his flanks. At this point, also, the Swiss revolted again, this time against the French, and Zürich became the last defensible position Masséna could take.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs <b>were</b> <b>facing</b> an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings.
