Bedigan enjoyed the soundtrack, saying that every song was [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "suits the game's 'extreme' feel". Kauderer thought that the game had an exceptional soundtrack, stating that since the use of licensed music in Wipeout 2097, the franchise had [...] "changed the face of the industry forever", although he opined that Wipeout Fusion had lost [...] "that cool edge". Davis praised the [...] "hard hitting" [...] techno soundtrack; saying that it was a type of music [...] "you'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to even when you weren't playing the game".

Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E
