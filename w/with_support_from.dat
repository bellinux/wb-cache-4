40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the differential relationships between different types and sources of social support and physical and mental health. Methods: Using data from the Normative Aging Study, 1, 386 older men (Mage = 62. 7) were categorized into four groups separately for frequency of interaction with networks and perceived support: those <b>with</b> high <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both family and friends, high <b>support</b> <b>from</b> family only, high <b>support</b> <b>from</b> friends only, and low <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources. Results: Over half the sample reported high levels of <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources; low support was relatively rare, although the old-old did report less frequent contact. One-way ANOVAs revealed that those <b>with</b> high perceived <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources reported better physical health and fewer depressive symptoms than those <b>with</b> low <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources or high <b>support</b> <b>from</b> family alone. Similarly, those <b>with</b> high perceived <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources had lower levels of depressive symptoms than those <b>with</b> low <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both sources, but frequency of contact was unrelated to physical health. Discussion: There was some support for differential benefits {{depending on the type}} or source of support, but, in general, those <b>with</b> high <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both family and friends reported the highest level of well being.
