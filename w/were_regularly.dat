5|$|Although his Parisian {{audience}} deserted him, Offenbach had by {{now become}} highly popular in England. John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre presented Offenbach's operettas to large and enthusiastic audiences. Between 1870 and 1872, the Gaiety produced 15 of his works. At the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte presented La Périchole in 1875. In Vienna, too, Offenbach works <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> produced.

5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization.

5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} road haulage had drawn away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> derailing on the line.|$|E
5|$|In Berlin Busoni was at {{the heart}} of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> programmed.

His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.|$|E

5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} supply lines, which {{stretched across the}} Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> carried out to protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts.

5|$|The Ottoman Empire spread {{further the}} use of this type of knife. In the Balkans, where it was known as Handschar, such knives <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> carried by Ottoman policemen, and it {{remained}} in local use also after the end of Ottoman rule. During the Second World War, the knife's name was bestowed on the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers; the knife also appeared on the division's emblem.|$|E
5|$|Anfield {{has been}} the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the {{finishing}} line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield. Boxing matches <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters {{was held at the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> {{travelling}} to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E

5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which {{at this stage of}} the war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E

At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that <b>were</b> <b>regularly</b> beaten heavily, though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot-stopping skills.|$|E
