50|$|Unlike LPB, {{traditional}} burnishing tools {{consist of}} a hard wheel or fixed lubricated ball pressed into the surface of an asymmetrical work piece with sufficient force to deform the surface layers, usually in a lathe. The process does multiple passes over the work pieces, usually under increasing load, to improve surface finish and deliberately cold work the surface. Roller and ball burnishing have been studied in Russia and Japan, and were applied most extensively in the USSR in the 1970s. Various burnishing methods are used, particularly in Eastern Europe, to improve fatigue life. Improvements in HCF, corrosion fatigue and SCC are documented, with fatigue strength enhancement attributed to improved finish, {{the development of a}} compressive surface layer, and the increased yield strength of the cold <b>worked</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

Although she made many drawings and prints, she is best known for her bronze outdoor sculpture, which has a distinctive cut and <b>worked</b> <b>surface.</b> This is created by her adding plaster to an armature, which she then worked back into with a chisel and surform.

After the coarse removal, the <b>worked</b> <b>surface</b> is polished with high-energy radiation, the surface contour and surface roughness of the surface are optically measured and compared with a desired surface contour and a desired surface roughness. If the measured surface contour or surface roughness deviates from the desired surface contour and desired surface roughness outside predetermined tolerance limits, extremely fine removal of material is performed by means of high-energy radiation until the deviation lies within the predetermined tolerance limits. The method is particularly suitable for the flexible production of optical elements with diameters greater than 1 mm and aspherical or freeform surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presents}} a multi response optimization approach {{to determine the}} optimal process parameters in {{wire electrical discharge machining}} process. Experiments have been conducted using six process parameters such as discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension and dielectric flow rate each at three levels for obtaining the responses like material removal rate, roughness value of the <b>worked</b> <b>surface</b> (a measure of surface finish), and kerf. Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array is used to gather information regarding the process with less number of experimental runs. Traditional Taguchi approach is insufficient to solve a multi response optimization problem. In order to overcome this limitation, a multi criteria decision making method, techniques for order preference by similarity to idealsolution (TOPSIS) is applied in the present study. In order to consider experimental uncertainty, the responses are expressed in linguistic terms rather than crisp values. The weight for each criterion (response) is obtained by analytical hierarchy process instead of using intuition and judgement of the decision maker...|$|E

Some microbes in biofilms can damage stone surfaces and cause discolouration. Although biofilm research has been carried out in Mediterranean regions, few studies cover temperate Northern Europe climates, or the UK oceanic climate. In a previous study we recorded env ironmental conditions of damaged, with deterioration of the <b>worked</b> <b>surface</b> to greater than 10 mm depth, and undamaged limestone at fifteen sites across two locations in Lincoln, UK, and sampled surfaces to detect biofilm associated bacterial species. A correlation between low surface pH and damage was observed, and bacterial species were isolated from the samples using media which would select for species which could survive {{in a wide range of}} conditions and identified at the genetic level. The isolated bacteria from that study have been tested for their ability to dissolve limestone, as well as resistance to commonly used biocides. We have identified species which, within our dataset, are solely or predo minantly associated with damaged limestone and also tested positive for dissolution of limestone. Many of these species have been previously associated with biodeterioration in studies from Tropical and Mediterranean climates.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{quadratic}} mathematical {{models have been}} derived to represent the process behavior of {{wire electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) operation. Experiments have been conducted with six process parameters: discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension and dielectric flow rate; to be varied in three different levels. Data related to the process responses viz. material removal rate (MRR), roughness value of the <b>worked</b> <b>surface</b> (a measure of surface finish, SF) and kerf have been measured for each of the experimental runs; which correspond to randomly chosen different combinations of factor setting. These data have been utilized to fit a quadratic mathematical model (Response Surface Model) for each of the responses, which can be represented {{as a function of the}} aforesaid six process parameters. Predicted data have been utilized for identification of the parametric influence in the form of graphical representation for showing influence of the parameters on selected responses. Predicted data given by the models (as per Taguchi’s L 27 (3 * 6) Orthogonal Array (OA) design) have been used in search of an optimal parametric combination to achieve desired yield of the process: maximum MRR, good surface finish (minimum roughness value) and dimensional accuracy of the product. Grey relational analysis has been adopted to convert this multi-objective criterion into an equivalent single objective function; overall grey relational grade, which has been optimized (maximized) by using Taguchi technique. Optimal setting has been verified through confirmatory test; showed good agreement to the predicted value. This indicates utility of the grey-Taguchi technique as multi-objective optimizer in the field of wire EDM...|$|E

40|$|Size {{effects in}} metals have {{received}} considerable attention in {{literature in the}} last decades. For preparing specimens dedicated processing techniques, such as laser-cutting, micro-milling, turning, etc., are used. Most of these processing methods intrinsically damage crystals just below the <b>worked</b> <b>surface.</b> In macroscopic applications, {{the effect on the}} overall mechanical behaviour can safely be neglected in most cases. Upon miniaturisation, however, the influence of the affected region becomes more important and may induce a processing induced size effect, which is far from negligible. Processing induced size effects are analysed by carefully characterising the plastic yielding in uniaxial tension of rectangular, 300 micrometer thick aluminium sheet specimens, with a well-defined homogeneous microstructure containing through-thickness grains. The specimens are processed to different widths by three independent machining techniques: (1) laser-cutting, (2) mechanical cutting, and (3) extensive grinding from a larger width. These independent techniques all result in a distinct processing induced size effect upon miniaturisation, i. e. an increase of up to 200 % in yield stress for a decrease from about 12 to 3 grains over the specimen width. Using a simple Taylor averaging model, it is shown that the yield stress in the affected edge region increased to 210 ¿ 350 % of its initial (or bulk) value. In addition, it is found that even a prolonged anneal near the melting temperature can only partially remove the processing induced size effect. The results clearly demonstrate that processing induced size effects have to be considered in the design of miniaturised devices and parts as well as in scientific research relying on the testing of manufactured small-scale test specimens...|$|E
