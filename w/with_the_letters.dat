5|$|The {{original}} NBN logo, {{featuring the}} numeral three inside a ring {{was replaced by}} several others over the years. The three was used due to the station's frequency allocation, being transmitted on VHF channel 3 from a transmitter atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. On 22 November 1979 the logo was updated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> NBN replacing the numeral three. The blue and green logo coincided with the renaming of the station from Channel Three to the current name, NBN Television, and its parent company renaming from the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation to NBN Limited.|$|E
5|$|When a {{tropical}} depression intensifies into {{a tropical}} storm {{to the north of}} the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W, it will be named by the NHC. There are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> A—Z used, skipping Q and U, with each name alternating between a male or a female name. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named using the letters of the Greek alphabet.|$|E

5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} dress of the Military Police Corps is a IDF regular uniform, {{with a white}} peaked cap, a brassard <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> Mem and Tzadik on the left arm, and a white belt.

30|$|The {{availability}} heuristic: Captures {{how people}} make judgements {{based on what}} is easily retrievable from memory, or simply what comes easily to mind. An example is when asked to list as many English words as possible that begin <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A. This is a simple task, because words beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A are fairly easily retrievable from memory. However, consider listing as many words as possible that have <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A as <b>the</b> third <b>letter</b> in <b>the</b> word. This {{is a much more}} difficult task, because words <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A as <b>the</b> third <b>letter</b> are less easily retrievable. As a consequence, one may conclude that there are more English words beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A, than words having <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> A as <b>the</b> third <b>letter,</b> simply because instances of the former is more easily accessible.|$|R

25|$|The names Aswarby and Swarby {{directly}} {{translate to}} two previous farm owners within each area.
