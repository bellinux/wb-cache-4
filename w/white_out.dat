25|$|White served {{five years}} of his seven-year {{sentence}} at Soledad State Prison and was paroled on January 7, 1984. Fearing White might be murdered in retaliation for his crimes, California State Corrections Officials secretly transported him to Los Angeles, where he served a year's parole. At the expiration of that year, White sought to return to San Francisco; Mayor Dianne Feinstein issued a public announcement of his plans, and a statement formally asking White not to return. (Joel Wachs, a Los Angeles City Council member, also argued to keep <b>White</b> <b>out</b> of Los Angeles.) White did move back to San Francisco and attempted to rebuild his life {{with his wife and}} children, but his marriage soon ended.|$|E
500|$|When {{the seventh}} game ended in victory, Flames fans in both Calgary and at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton spilled {{onto the streets}} in celebration. The [...] "C of Red" [...] was born in that playoff series as fans responded to a {{promotion}} to wear the colour with such enthusiasm that many stores across the city sold out of red clothing. The effect was most pronounced during games, where nearly every fan in the Saddledome was in red. [...] The C of Red inspired the Winnipeg Jets to create their <b>White</b> <b>Out</b> the following year.|$|E
500|$|It was on {{the back}} of this form that White once again toured Pakistan with the Australia A squad, but he {{finished}} the series with just two wickets, both coming in the first-class matches, and a handful of runs. Two months into the Australian domestic season, White was forced to retire hurt after colliding with Queensland bowler Lee Carseldine, and after the match it was revealed he'd fractured his foot. He'd been carrying the injury {{since the start of the}} season, and the collision led to a full break, putting <b>White</b> <b>out</b> for six weeks. [...] White conceded that the injury would almost certainly rule out any chance he had of playing for the national team that summer. He returned in early January, playing the last three matches of the Twenty20 tournament, including the final which Victoria won by 32 runs, although White only managed to make one run off eight balls. For the second season in a row, White was named as captain of the Prime Minister's XI, and claimed two Sri Lankan wickets in the 50-over contest. White led Victoria to both Pura Cup and Ford Ranger Cup finals in 2007–08, but they lost both, to New South Wales and Tasmania respectively.|$|E

500|$|White was {{recalled}} to the Australian ODI and Twenty20 squads for the 2008 {{tour of the}} West Indies. He scored 10runs off 6balls in a rain-reduced 11-over Twenty20 contest, and in a 50-over tour {{match against}} University of West Indies Vice-Chancellor's XI, made 34 but remained wicket-less in his eight overs with the ball. By this stage in his career, White was generally considered a middle-order batsman who bowled a bit, but Australia captain Ponting saw {{his place in the}} team as that of the front-line spinner. [...] "White's obviously been picked as the spinner on this tour. We just need to keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure. Hopefully he plays a big role for us during the series." [...] Despite Ponting's comments, he used White as the fourth-change bowler in the first ODI, bringing the slow left-arm spin of Michael Clarke on first. White conceded 32runs in his six overs without a breakthrough, and did not bowl at all in the second match, as Clarke claimed the man of the match award for his half-century and three wickets. [...] Although White scored 40* at quicker than a run a ball, the return of Andrew Symonds for the last three ODIs left <b>White</b> <b>out</b> of the team again.|$|E

2500|$|The Winnipeg Whiteout is {{a hockey}} {{tradition}} {{that dates back}} to 1986 when fans were asked to wear white clothing to home playoff games, creating a very intimidating effect and atmosphere.

The Jets eliminated the Flames in six games, and fans wore white for every home playoff game thereafter. Fans dubbed it the [...] "White Out." [...] Marketing for the team during the playoff referred to the [...] "charge of the white brigade."

2500|$|Due in part {{to public}} discontent and {{in part to}} a {{campaign}} for re-examination by Vette himself, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was formed on 7 July 1980 to examine the TAIC's finding of pilot error. Vette's research, along with other evidence, was presented to High Court Judge Peter Mahon, {{who was in charge of}} the commission. Vette served as an adviser to Mahon during the proceedings, and his findings proved especially influential. Justice Mahon even took a helicopter ride to Mt. Erebus during the course of his investigation to experience the phenomenon of sector whiteout for himself. As he later described it, [...] "I was taken for a flight myself in <b>white</b> <b>out</b> conditions and saw with my own eyes the flat terrain of ice and snow stretching forth for more than forty miles when in fact right in front of us there was a snow ridge several hundred feet high". Mahon's final report was published on 27 April 1981, and it largely agreed with Vette's hypotheses. Mahon found Air New Zealand to be financially responsible, describing their attempts to shift the blame on to the late flight crew as [...] "very clearly part of an attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders". ANZ appealed the ruling to the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and, although the financial penalties were ultimately removed, the court declined to overturn any of Mahon's factual findings.|$|E

Jan. 22, 1983, NFC Championship Game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, prior to the game the stadium {{physically}} shook as a capacity crowd of 54,000 chanted [...] "We Want Dallas!" [...] The game is best remembered for the quarterback hit by Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley that knocked Cowboys' quarterback Danny <b>White</b> <b>out</b> for the rest of the game and sent him into the locker room shortly before halftime, and Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grant's interception which he returned for a 10-yard touchdown off one of Cowboys' backup quarterback Gary Hogeboom's passes which was tipped by Dexter Manley to score the decisive points. John Riggins rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries and the Redskins went on to defeat the Cowboys' by a score of 31–17. The Redskins' first Super Bowl win, and their first NFL Championship in 40 years, was in Super Bowl XVII, where the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–17 on January 30, 1983. [...] Riggins provided the game's signature play when, on 4th and inches, with the Redskins down 17–13, the coaches called [...] "70 Chip", a play designed for short yardage.
