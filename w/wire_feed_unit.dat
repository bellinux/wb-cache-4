Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed should increase as well.

Originality/value: This research revealed the relationship between the welding speed and the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed considering the welding productivity and quality. In addition, the criterion to evaluate the degree of weldability during lap welding is suggested according to the quality and objective functions...|$|R

Most of the grains in the samples are equiaxed grains, and a small amount of short columnar grains exist which are parallel to each other. The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire.</b> The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|R

40|$|Control of the Gas Metal Arc {{welding process}} is {{becoming}} increasingly sophisticated, due to improvements in technology and {{a better understanding of}} the process itself. To effectively conduct research in this area, it is necessary to have equipment that is extremely flexible in both architecture and operation. Experimental power sources and a welding test facility have been developed at the University of Wollongong which meet these criteria. The core time-critical control functions are performed by an independent digital signal processor (DSP). Non time-critical functions such as data storage and operator interface are performed by a desktop personal computer. Both computing platforms are readily programmable, allowing a variety of control strategies to be tested merely by changing software. Welding current is supplied to the process using a custom-built electronic power source with very high dynamic response and rapid current turn-off. The electrode feeding is accomplished by a bidirectional <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> <b>unit</b> with a time constant of approximately 2 milliseconds. Visualisation of the welding process is achieved through the use of a CCD camera and high-power xenon flash unit, which are both synchronised to process events by the DSP controller.

The inherent flexibility of the architecture also allows for another arc welding process, such as Gas Tungsten Arc welding, to be operated simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|As laser brazing {{benefits}} from advantages such as smooth joints and small heat-affected zones, {{it has become}} established as a joining technology that is widely used in the automotive industry. With the processing of complex-shaped geometries, recent developed brazing heads suffer, however, from the need for continuous reorientation of the optical system and/or limited accessibility due to lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> This motivates {{the development of a}} laser brazing head with coaxial <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and enhanced functionality.
