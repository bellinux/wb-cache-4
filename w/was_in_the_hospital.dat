5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E

25|$|A major {{reference}} source used by Basquiat {{throughout his career}} was the book Gray's Anatomy, which his mother had given him while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> at age seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' Symbol Sourcebook, Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Brentjes' African Rock Art.|$|E
25|$|By 1954 Robert F. Kennedy and McCarthy's chief aide Roy Cohn had had {{a falling}} out, and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy.

Joe Kennedy strongly supported McCarthy to the end.|$|E

25|$|The Vanderbilt Commodores {{beat the}} Mississippi A & M Aggies {{in the seventh}} week of play 18–0. Coach Lewie Hardage had come back from {{scouting}} the Aggies, giving the sense the Commodores were sure to lose. Mississippi A & M gave Tulane its only loss this year.

The Aggies were coached by Earl Abell.|$|E
25|$|While Morenz <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> {{plans for}} a game for Morenz's benefit were already under way. However, the game was not as {{successful}} as Bailey's game, partially because it took place many months after Morenz's passing (on November 3 at the Forum) and partially because Morenz had not survived. The game saw two All-Star teams, the first being a team of stars from the Canadiens and the Montreal Maroons, the second being an All-Star team made of players from the other teams, with the latter team winning 6–5.|$|E
40|$|Over 20 months, we prospectively {{assessed}} the yield of cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter spp. from adults and children. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first 10 months, 53 % (567 of 1, 097) of specimens from adults were from {{patients who had}} <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for > 3 days.

Thirty percent (368 of 1, 229) of specimens were rejected. Concurrently, 7. 5 % (51 of 677) of stool specimens from children were positive. Only one positive specimen came from a child who had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for > 3 days. Neither stool consistency nor fecal leukocytes were useful predictors {{for the presence of}} an enteric pathogen. We recommend that specimens from both adults and children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for > 3 days not be cultured unless there are delineated plausible clinical or epidemiological reasons to do so...|$|R

25|$|When Morton {{was stabbed}} and wounded, a nearby whites-only {{hospital}} refused to treat him, {{as the city}} had racially segregated facilities. He was transported to a black hospital farther away. When he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury. His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath. Morton made {{a new series of}} commercial recordings in New York, several reprising tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically {{in the center of}} action. His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554.

They had held a prayer vigil for him while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> which transitioned directly into a memorial on hearing of his death. The funeral was held a few days later with contributions from some ministers as well as friends and a memorial a couple days after that.
