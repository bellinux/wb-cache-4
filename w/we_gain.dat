25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, {{and how do we}} know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E
25|$|Adventitious {{ideas are}} those {{concepts}} that <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> through sense experiences, ideas {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends, and fairy tales are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas we have {{as a result of}} mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E

25|$|Plato was {{the first}} philosopher who {{systematically}} inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but {{it is from the}} Meno that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> through experience.|$|E
25|$|As yet an {{alternative}} {{set of rules}} that takes this into account has not been fully developed. Most {{progress has been made}} based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting, whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices. For every stellation of some polyhedron, there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron, and vice versa. By studying facettings of the dual, <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> insights into the stellations of the original. Bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual, the dodecahedron.|$|E
2500|$|The Indispensability of Reason Thesis has the {{following}} rationale, [...] "The knowledge <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> in subject area, S, by intuition and deduction, {{as well as}} the ideas and instances of knowledge in S that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience." [...] In short, this thesis claims that experience cannot provide what <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> from reason.|$|E

2500|$|According to Stephen Laumakis, pratītyasamutpāda {{is also an}} {{epistemological}} principle; that is, {{a theory}} about how <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality. The 'dependent origination' doctrine, states Peter Harvey, [...] "highlights the Buddhist notion that all apparently substantial entities within the world are in fact wrongly perceived. We live under the illusion that terms such as 'I', [...] self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things. The doctrine teaches this is not so." [...] There is nothing permanent (anicca), nothing substantial, no unique individual self {{in the nature of}} becoming and existence (anatta), because everything is a result of [...] "dependent origination". There are no independent objects and independent subjects, according to the Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine, there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{it covers}} both how <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> {{knowledge}} about objects and our reflections {{on our own}} actions, Piaget's model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for. For example, by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting {{on the effects of}} their own previous knowledge, they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures. Thus, once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals, he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as [...] "birds", [...] "fish", and so on. This is significant because they are now able to know things about a new animal simply {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is a bird – for example, that it will lay eggs.|$|E
2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, [...] "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems." [...] The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either consciously or unconsciously, a rationalist claims we don't really [...] "learn" [...] things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.|$|E

2500|$|The Last Break Southward (1995) is the magnum opus of Zhirinovsky {{in which}} he {{expressed}} his worldview. [...] "Since the 1980s, I have elaborated a geopolitical conception—the last break southward, Russia's reach to {{the shores of the}} Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean." [...] This is [...] "really the solution for the salvation of the Russian nation … It solves all problems and <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> tranquility." [...] Russia will rule the space [...] "from Kabul to Istanbul." [...] The United States would feel safer with the Russian rule in the region, since wars there would cease under the Russian rule. Perhaps, some people in Kabul, Teheran, or Ankara would not like it but many people would feel better. [...] "The Persians and Turks would suffer a bit but all the rest would gain." [...] The [...] "bells of the Orthodox Church must bell from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean." [...] And Jerusalem becomes close. It is necessary that [...] "the Christian world reunifies in Jerusalem." [...] The Palestinian problem can be solved by partial transfer of the Palestinian population to the former territories of Turkey and Iran. The great Russian language and Russian ruble would wield Near Eastern and Central Asian peoples into one Russian citizenship.|$|E
2500|$|Ptolemy first {{proposes that}} it is not [...] "useless" [...] to create {{predictions}} of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in Cicero's text De Divinatione, in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they [...] offer no means of escape. Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject [...] "by which <b>we</b> <b>gain</b> full view of things human and divine", which, he argues, gives a better perception of [...] "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament". He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; {{the same can be said}} of all philosophy, which concerns itself with [...] "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because [...] "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".|$|E
