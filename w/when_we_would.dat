500|$|When portraying Ellie, Johnson faced {{challenges}} in performing scenes {{that made her}} feel uncomfortable. [...] "There were some days <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> shoot things that even at my age made me feel a little uncomfortable," [...] Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never {{included in the final}} game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.|$|E

Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding {{in the face of}} efforts by other ministers to [...] "spare" [...] their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying [...] "If I change anything, everything will unravel".

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said.
