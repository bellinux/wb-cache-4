5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> {{from other}} working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding <b>with</b> <b>dogs,</b> while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it <b>with</b> <b>dogs.</b> The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E

5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} England, the breed flourished under the {{patronage}} of Queen Victoria. Her many Pugs, which she bred herself, included Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima and Venus. Her involvement <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> in general helped {{to establish the}} Kennel Club, which was formed in 1873. Queen Victoria favoured apricot and fawn colours. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was {{possible}} to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting <b>with</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported {{back to where they}} were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|E

5|$|Outside of India, golden jackals in the Caucasus and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} golden jackals of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. Golden jackals in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. Golden jackals from both the Balkans and the Caucasus are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, golden jackals from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli jackals having hybridized <b>with</b> <b>dogs,</b> gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Reckless {{hunting and}} loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human {{settlement}} have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. Natural calamities, like drought, are also major threats. While populations have declined in northern Cameroon due to degradation of floodplains through the construction of upstream dams, their habitat has been destroyed in Chad and Tanzania due to expansion of agriculture and settlement. Several deaths occur due to roadkill and drowning as well. During the dry season, bohor reedbuck are hunted <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> and nets in Uganda. Reedbuck with the largest horns are prized by hunters.|$|E
5|$|The Hunting Bill was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} Labour’s 2001 general election manifesto pledge to hold a free vote on banning fox hunting and would make it illegal to hunt wild animals in England and Wales <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> except in limited circumstances. The bill {{was passed by the}} House of Commons on 3 December 2002 but rejected by the House of Lords. It was reintroduced to, and passed by, the House of Commons on 9 September 2004, but was significantly amended by the House of Lords. The House of Commons rejected the amendments on 18 November and the bill was granted Royal Assent later that day through the use of the Parliament Acts. The Hunting Act was due to come into force on 18 February 2005.|$|E

5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted {{to break up the}} melee <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport the day after the game.|$|E
5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts dog show. Charles first became {{involved}} <b>with</b> <b>dogs</b> {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem <b>with</b> <b>dogs.</b> A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} serum {{concentrations of}} biochemical markers and survival time in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 29 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE and 18 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> food-responsive diarrhea (FRD). PROCEDURES: Data regarding serum concentrations of various biochemical markers {{at the initial}} evaluation were available for 18 of the 29 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE and compared <b>with</b> findings for <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> FRD. Correlations between biochemical marker concentrations and survival time (interval between time of initial evaluation and death or euthanasia) for <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum C-reactive protein concentration was high in 13 of 18 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE and in 2 of 18 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> FRD. Serum concentration of canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity was high in 3 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE but within the reference interval in all <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> FRD. Serum α 1 -proteinase inhibitor concentration was less than the lower reference limit in 9 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE and 1 <b>dog</b> <b>with</b> FRD. Compared <b>with</b> findings in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> FRD, values of those 3 variables in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE were significantly different. Serum calprotectin (measured by radioimmunoassay and ELISA) and S 100 A 12 concentrations were high but {{did not differ significantly}} between groups. Seventeen of the 29 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE were euthanized owing to this disease; median survival time was 67 days (range, 2 to 2, 551 days). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Serum C-reactive protein, canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, and α 1 -proteinase inhibitor concentrations differed significantly between <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE and FRD. Most initial biomarker concentrations were not predictive of survival time in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> PLE...|$|R
