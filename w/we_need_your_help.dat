Thankfully, many of you wanted to join the conversation and add your voice to the newsletter. This is evidenced by ten terrific articles written by members of the community that span everything from high school to undergraduates to 1 st year of graduate school and to mid-career computer scientists. We urge our community to continue to add to the conversations we have started here. Please consider submitting an article proposal for our winter issue with new ideas and perspectives — or challenge some ideas presented here. In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not sure who to ask, but really need an answer for.

5000|$|Subject: SABRINA HAS ESCAPEDSelect fellow {{members of}} the class of 2008:This email has been sent to 50 {{hand-picked}} {{members of the}} class of 2008. We ask for your assistance in a matter of the greatest importance.As our time as Amherst undergraduates comes to a bittersweet close, we are not quite ready to let it go just yet--such a small community is not easily left behind. Therefore we find ourselves, in these final days, wishing for a capstone occasion for class-wide collaboration, collective spirit, and yes, a little mischief. And so we write to you with a proposition:As many of you may know, Amherst was blessed long ago with the protection and guidance of the river goddess Sabrina. In 1857 the governor of Massachusetts bestowed a bronze statue of the water nymph upon the College on the Hill, and since that time she has excited generations of Amherst students, inspiring legendary battles between odd year classes and even year classes over her custody. During one year, she was dangled over the campus in a plane; another year, she was held out of a passing train, causing athletes to drop their equipment {{in the middle of a}} game, and charge after the elusive statue.Sabrina's ventures, however, were recently halted. Several years ago, she was returned to the College administration, who hid her away in dark and secret location, bringing her into daylight for only the occasional class reunion. This neglect has no doubt saddened our fair protectress, and even worse, we fear she has begun to slip from the collective memory of Amherst undergraduates. You will surely agree that she hardly deserves such a fate, and so we are certain that you will be excited by the news we bring today:SABRINA HAS BEEN LIBERATED! Some time ago, a few of your fellow classmates crept into a bunker, hidden in the mountains around our valley, and absconded the beautiful goddess. (And the administration may not yet even know she's gone!) We cannot, of course, disclose our identities just yet, nor can we display Sabrina publicly, for fear that the administrative forces of the College will work fervently to repossess her. We can, however, tell you that we are {{members of the class}} of 2008, and that Sabrina is currently in our safekeeping. We hope you find the attached photo of bikini-clad-Sabrina (posed with a recent copy of the Amherst Student) sufficient evidence of our sincerity. We now turn to you, fellow class members, and ask for your assistance in bringing Sabrina back into the Amherst public eye.The plan is this:This Friday, May 9, is our last day of class as Amherst students, and it is also the day of our senior dinner and assembly. As such, it is the perfect occasion to celebrate the fact that the class of 2008 has liberated Sabrina, but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> <b>help</b> to pull it off. Imagine the following: Friday morning, the Amherst community awakes to find painted posters inside Keefe and outside Val, proclaiming the liberation of Sabrina. Sidewalk chalk scrawled throughout campus reads [...] "Where is she? Liberated! -Class of 2008." [...] Flyers are posted on bulletin boards everywhere, showing pictures of Sabrina, free of her confines, and messages celebrating her escape. Students enter Valentine to find copies of the History of Sabrina beside the day's New York Times. Even the public computers on campus have had their boring old wallpaper replaced by pictures of Sabrina. (Anyone have connections with IT?) And so on--suggestions are welcome.For those of you who are willing to help out in the early hours Friday morning (distributing a few flyers, painting a sign, writing on sidewalks, or any other ideas you may have) reply to this email as soon as possible. We will orchestrate the efforts from here, and we're confident that together our class can turn this occasion into one hell of a memory. Please pass this email along and invite fellow members of 2008 to participate, or invite members of our fellow even year class, 2010, to help out. But please, DO NOT breath a word of the endeavor to either the College faculty or to members of odd-year classes. The better we can keep these plans under wraps until Friday, the more impressive the roll-out will be. Needless to say, those of you who are willing to help out will be first in our minds when we organize a secret meeting between Sabrina and the members of our class.Again, we want to reiterate how great these four years have been, and we are optimistic that Friday will be the perfect way to top it all off. But we can only make it happen with your help. Who's in?Yours,'08 ...|$|E

40|$|A satire on the Barnburners, {{a radical}} faction of New York State Democrats, led by John Van Buren, whose {{commitment}} {{to social and}} monetary reforms was likened to a farmer's burning his barn to rid it of rats. Here the barn is ablaze, trapping several of the movement's leaders on its roof. Benjamin F. Butler, raising his arms, vows, "If I ever {{get out of this}} scrape safe it's the last act of Barn burning that I'll be guilty of. " New York "Evening Post" editor and radical spokesman William Cullen Bryant despairs, "Woe is me! I can't get off, and if I stay up here it's sure destruction!" An unidentified man says, "Alas! alas! we're caught in a tight fix. " At right John Van Buren vainly tries to raise a ladder to the roof, complaining, "I can't get near enough to help them down with the ladder, so old Dad you'd better jump off. " His father, Martin Van Buren, appearing here as a fox, leaps {{from the other end of}} the roof, saying, "Our sufferings is intolerable! I'll take your advice my son and jump off [...] So here goes!" On the far right New Hampshire Democrat Franklin Pierce has mired his wagon in a muddy lane. It is loaded with boxes "Free Trade" and "No Internal Improvements," traditional Democratic planks. Pierce calls to Bryant, "there's more truth than poetry in what you say. <b>We</b> never <b>needed</b> <b>your</b> <b>help</b> more, for <b>we</b> are stuck in the mud and want your shoulder to the wheel. " Although Weitenkampf tentatively dates the cartoon 1847, the inclusion of Franklin Pierce suggests a later date.
