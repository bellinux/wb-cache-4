50|$|Some coco peat is {{not fully}} {{decomposed}} when it arrives and will use up available nitrogen as it does so (known as drawdown), competing with the plant {{if there is not}} enough. This is called nitrogen robbery; it can cause nitrogen deficiency in the plants. Poorly sourced coco fibre can have excess salts in it and needs washing (check electrical conductivity of run-off <b>water,</b> <b>flush</b> if high). It holds water well and holds around 1000 times more air than soil. Adding slow release fertilizers or organic fertilizers are highly advised when growing with coco fibre.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{contamination}} was revealed to {{be a combination of}} different events. A maintenance man in the Nokia waterworks had opened a valve between tap water and sewage water pipes to let some tap <b>water</b> <b>flush</b> out the sewage pipe. The valve had been previously installed against regulations. Because of pressure differences, the water flowed in the opposite direction, contaminating the tap water. At the same time, maintenance work was being carried out at another site, so the first calls from people complaining about the water were not taken seriously because they were thought to be connected with that event. It took two days until an official warning was given that the water was contaminated and until bottled water deliveries were started.|$|E

[...] This is an important precedent because it reversed the 1st Graham's factor (commercial success).

5000|$|The patent in {{this case}} covered [...] "a <b>water</b> <b>flush</b> system to remove cow manure {{from the floor of}} a dairy barn." [...] The system was a {{combination}} of conventional, well-known elements, using flowing water to flush cow manure from a barn. [...] "Systems using flowing water to clean animal wastes from barn floors have been familiar on dairy farms since ancient times." [...] The Court cited the fifth labor of Hercules (cleaning the Augean stables) as an example. It was conceded that each element of the claimed combination was found in the prior art. [...] "The only claimed inventive feature of the patented combination of old elements is the provision for abrupt release of the water from the tanks or pools directly onto the barn floor, which causes the flow of a sheet of water that washes all animal waste into drains within minutes and requires no supplemental hand labor." ...|$|E
50|$|With {{the design}} complete, {{construction}} {{is the next}} step. Most soil nail wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and hydraulic drills. Next, holes for the soil nails are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground. For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and <b>water</b> <b>flush</b> or hollow stem auger methods are used. With the holes drilled, {{the next step is to}} install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain. A layer of shotcrete is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the soil nail wall. Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Maya - Bee. The series main protagonist. She loves freedom, {{living in}} the meadow by herself unlike other bees {{who live in the}} hive. She is good, fair, happy and willing to help everybody. She was born in a bee hive. At the {{beginning}} of the third season Bella wanted Maya ejected from the hive, because she was worried that other bees would copy her behaviour of waxing. The Queen Lara/Lala of the hive dissuaded King, (tale of two tulips), after Maya saved her teacher Cassandra. Maya is very adventurous, and this often causes problems. For example, Maya got lost in underground corridors due to cascading <b>water</b> <b>flush</b> out of tulips. Her appearance with other animated characters is about 70/20. In first season her feature is rounded, but in second season it is more geoid. In the third season she is very intelligent, her features is thinly rounded and she has elongated aerial antennae. Although Maya is a nimble bee, she has wasp colours (yellow-black). Maya is the most popular and most influential character on the meadow. Her best friend is Willy a bumble bee and she does not like or avoids the spider Theklari. Her main enemies are wasps (mainly in third season) and hornets. Peter, Phillip and Gucio also makes up a characters good or bad.|$|E

40|$|In this work, fresh {{soybean meal}} {{was used as}} the {{substrate}} for both batch and continuous experiments in a rotational drum fermentation (RDF) system to characterize the acidogenic process of solid organic waste degradation at high unionized volatile acid (U-VA) level and evaluate the effect of <b>water</b> <b>flushing</b> on the acidogenic performance. The experiments were conducted under mesophilic condition with a reaction time of 20 days. The results of the batch experiment showed that U-VA had a growing adverse effect on the volatile acid (VA) production and hydrolysis of the substrate as the initially added U-VA concentration increased (0, 5, 15, 25 g/L). VA formation deteriorated drastically when the initial U-VA concentration exceeded 5 g/L. VS degradation ratios decreased from 43. 8 % to 7. 3 %, and the hydrolysis rate constants varied between 28. 8 and 3. 8 × 10 − 3 /d in response to the initial U-VA concentration. In the continuous experiment, two cascade process configurations (CP 1 and CP 2) without and with VA removal by <b>water</b> <b>flushing,</b> respectively, were developed. The results showed that the hydrolysis rate constants and VS degradation ratios were 13. 1 × 10 − 3 /d and 23 %, respectively, in CP 2, while only 9. 1 × 10 − 3 /d and 16. 7 % in CP 2. Compared to CP 1, the VA spectrum varied little in CP 2 with <b>water</b> <b>flushing.</b> It suggested that the higher U-VA level had a significant inhibition on the acidogenic process of solid organic waste degradation, and the VA removal by <b>water</b> <b>flushing</b> improved the acidogenic performance...|$|R
