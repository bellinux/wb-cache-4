40|$|Abstract—This work {{demonstrates}} that the integration of vari-able-speed <b>wind</b> <b>systems</b> with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) and a four-quadrant ac-to-ac converter connected to the rotor windings increases the transient stability margin of the electrical grids, {{when compared with the}} case where the fixed speed <b>wind</b> <b>systems</b> with cage generators are used. It is due to the influence of the two dedicated rotor current regulators of the DFIG on the dynamic behavior of the other generators in the system. Besides, adequate models to represent the behavior of the DFIG in transient stability studies are presented. From the simulation results, some important conclusions can be extracted to guide the integration of the wind farms on weak or strong grids.
