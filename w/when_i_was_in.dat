30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that the values of m(i) are {{influenced}} by the position of i in the topology. In particular, nodes that are close to the periphery will have larger values compared to nodes that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the center of the topology. This can be explained noting that <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the periphery of the network, its average distance from the other nodes <b>is</b> larger than <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the center, so m(i) is higher on the periphery. It is also easy to see that in this simple topology, if we compute t(i) excluding the packets that <b>are</b> generated by <b>i</b> itself, t(i) <b>is</b> constant. This would make the ratio t(i)/m(i) decrease for nodes close to the extreme ends of the network. In the figure, instead, we plot t(i) including also the packets generated by node i, which increases the values of t(i) on the periphery. This takes into account that in our scenario, each node is a gateway for its own subnet, so the first hop <b>is</b> counted <b>in</b> its own subnet. Even in this case, t(i)/m(i) is still larger for nodes that <b>are</b> central <b>in</b> the topology.|$|R
