Three major radiations of New World Typhlops are postulated to account for the radiations of the present species groups...|$|R

50|$|These cranes are omnivores, eating plants, seeds, grain, insects, frogs, <b>worms,</b> <b>snakes,</b> {{small fish}} and the eggs of aquatic animals. Stamping their feet as they walk, they flush out insects which are quickly caught and eaten.

At night, the crowned crane spends its time in the trees sleeping and resting.|$|R
