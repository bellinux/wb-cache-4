60|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether the fertility of the self-fertilised plants had been lessened by the plants having been self-fertilised for the three previous generations, thirty flowers on the crossed plants were fertilised with their own pollen. These yielded only five capsules, and their seeds being placed in separate <b>watch-glasses</b> did not seem more numerous than those from the capsules on the self-fertilised plants self-fertilised for the fourth time. So {{that as far as}} can be judged from so few capsules, the self-fertility of the self-fertilised plants had not decreased in comparison with that of the plants which had been intercrossed during the three previous generations. It should, however, be remembered that both lots of plants had been subjected in each generation to almost exactly similar conditions.|$|R

60|$|Seeds {{from plants}} {{of the fifth}} {{generation}} crossed and self-fertilised in the usual manner were sown {{on opposite sides of}} several pots. On the self-fertilised side every single plant belonged to the tall white variety. On the crossed side some plants belonged to this variety, but the greater number approached in character to the old and shorter kinds with smaller yellowish flowers blotched with coppery brown. When the plants on both sides were from 2 to 3 inches in height they were equal, but when fully grown the self-fertilised were decidedly the tallest and finest plants, but, from want of time, they were not actually measured. In half the pots the first plant which flowered was a self-fertilised one, and in the other half a crossed one. And now another remarkable change was clearly perceived, namely, that the self-fertilised plants had become more self-fertile than the crossed. The pots were all put under a net to exclude insects, and the crossed plants produced spontaneously only fifty-five capsules, whilst the self-fertilised plants produced eighty-one capsules, or as 100 to 147. The seeds from nine capsules of both lots were placed in separate <b>watch-glasses</b> for comparison, and the self-fertilised appeared rather the more numerous. Besides these spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, twenty flowers on the crossed plants again crossed yielded sixteen capsules; twenty-five flowers on the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised yielded seventeen capsules, and this is a larger proportional number of capsules than was produced by the self-fertilised flowers on the self-fertilised plants in the previous generations. The contents of ten capsules of both these lots were compared in separate <b>watch-glasses,</b> and the seeds from the self-fertilised appeared decidedly more numerous than those from the crossed plants.|$|R
60|$|Seeds {{from the}} {{foregoing}} plants, fertilised {{in the manner}} just stated, were sown on the opposite sides of a small pot (1) and came up crowded. The four tallest crossed seedlings, {{at the time of}} flowering, averaged 8 inches in height, whilst the four tallest self-fertilised plants averaged only 4 inches. Crossed seeds were sown by themselves in a second small pot, and self-fertilised seeds were sown by themselves in a third small pot so that there was no competition whatever between these two lots. Nevertheless the crossed plants grew from 1 to 2 inches higher on an average than the self-fertilised. Both lots looked equally vigorous, but the crossed plants flowered earlier and more profusely than the self-fertilised. In Pot 1, in which the two lots competed with each other, the crossed plants flowered first and produced a large number of capsules, whilst the self-fertilised produced only nineteen. The contents of twelve capsules from the crossed flowers on the crossed plants, and of twelve capsules from self-fertilised flowers on the self-fertilised plants, were placed in separate <b>watch-glasses</b> for comparison; and the crossed seeds seemed more numerous by half than the self-fertilised.|$|R
60|$|As I {{wished to}} ascertain, firstly, whether those self-fertilised plants {{of the last}} generation, which greatly {{exceeded}} in height their crossed opponents, would transmit the same tendency to their offspring, and secondly, whether they possessed the same sexual constitution, I selected for experiment the two self-fertilised plants marked A and B in Pot 3 in Table 6/85, as these two were of nearly equal height, and were greatly superior to their crossed opponents. Four flowers on each plant were fertilised with their own pollen, and four others on the same plants were crossed with pollen {{from one of the}} crossed plants growing in another pot. This plan differs from that before followed, in which seedlings from crossed plants again crossed, have been compared with seedlings from self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised. The seeds from the crossed and self-fertilised capsules of the above two plants were placed in separate <b>watch-glasses</b> and compared, but were not weighed; and in both cases those from the crossed capsules seemed to be rather less numerous than those from the self-fertilised capsules. These seeds were planted in the usual manner, and the heights of the crossed and self-fertilised seedlings, when fully grown, are given in Tables 6/86 and 6/87.|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to apply the {{assumption}} that a monolayer of serum exists at a certain dilution, in order to calculate the thickness of this layer or, that is to say, the mean value of one of the dimensions of the molecules of the serum proteins. The criterion taken for the existence of such a monolayer was the existence at a given concentration (1 / 11, 000 for rabbit serum) of a maximum drop in the surface tension of serum solutions kept in <b>watch-glasses.</b> A series of preliminary experiments showed: 1. That the maximum drop in 2 hours took place, for the material used, at a concentration of 1 / 11, 000, and that it always corresponded to an absolute minimum value of the surface tension of the solution, this minimum being quite sharp and well defined. 2. That adsorption took place on the glass {{as well as on the}} free surface of the liquid, and that apparently the same part of the molecule, in both cases, was drawn toward the water. 3. That the specific gravity of the anhydrous proteins of the rabbit serum studied was 1. 275, whence it followed, on the basis of 6. 51 per cent protein content, that the mean thickness of the protein molecules was 35. 4 x 10 – 8 cm. The same method applied to crystalline egg albumin, pH 6. 8, in water, gave 52. 8 x 10 – 8 cm. for the probable molecular length...|$|R
60|$|A fine plant {{growing in}} my garden (one of the {{foregoing}} seedlings) {{was covered with a}} net, and six flowers were crossed with pollen from another flower on the same plant, and six others were fertilised with their own pollen. All produced good capsules. The seeds from each were placed in separate <b>watch-glasses,</b> and no difference could be perceived by the eye between the two lots of seeds; and when they were weighed there was no difference of any significance, as the seeds from the self-fertilised capsules weighed 7.65 grains, whilst those from the crossed capsules weighed 7.7 grains. Therefore the sterility of the present species, when insects are excluded, is not due to the impotence of pollen on the stigma of the same flower. Both lots of seeds and seedlings were treated in exactly the same manner as in Table 3/23, excepting that after the pairs of germinating seeds had been planted on the opposite sides of eight pots, all the remaining seeds were thickly sown on the opposite sides of Pots 9 and 10 in Table 3/24. The young plants during the following spring were turned out of their pots, without being disturbed, and planted in the open ground in two rows, not very close together, so that they were subjected to only moderately severe competition with one another. Very differently to what occurred in the first experiment, when the plants were subjected to somewhat severe mutual competition, an equal number on each side either died or did not produce flower-stems. The tallest flower-stems on the surviving plants were measured, as shown in Table 3/24.|$|R
60|$|This salt is more {{powerful}} than the nitrate, even in a greater degree than the nitrate is {{more powerful}} than the carbonate. This is shown by weaker solutions of the phosphate acting when dropped on the discs, or applied to the glands of the exterior tentacles, or when leaves are immersed. The difference in the power of these three salts, as tried in three different ways, supports the results presently to be [page 154] given, which are so surprising that their credibility requires every kind of support. In 1872 I experimented on twelve immersed leaves, giving each only ten minims of a solution; but this was a bad method, for so small a quantity hardly covered them. None of these experiments will, therefore, be given, though they indicate that excessively minute doses are efficient. When I read over my notes, in 1873, I entirely disbelieved them, and determined to make another set of experiments with scrupulous care, on the same plan as those made with the nitrate; namely by placing leaves in <b>watch-glasses,</b> and pouring over each thirty minims of the solution under trial, treating {{at the same time and}} in the same manner other leaves with the distilled water used in making the solutions. During 1873, seventy-one leaves were thus tried in solutions of various strengths, and the same number in water. Notwithstanding the care taken and the number of the trials made, when in the following year I looked merely at the results, without reading over my observations, I again thought that there must have been some error, and thirty-five fresh trials were made with the weakest solution; but the results were as plainly marked as before. Altogether, 106 carefully selected leaves were tried, both in water and in solutions of the phosphate. Hence, after the most anxious consideration, I can entertain no doubt of the substantial accuracy of my results.|$|R

60|$|Vapour of Nitric Ether.--This vapour {{seems more}} {{injurious}} {{than that of}} sulphuric ether. A plant was exposed for 5 m. in a 12-oz. vessel to eight drops in a <b>watch-glass,</b> and I distinctly saw a few tentacles curling inwards before the glass was removed. Immediately afterwards bits of meat were placed on three glands, but no movement ensued {{in the course of}} 18 m. The same plant was placed again under the same vessel for 16 m. with ten drops of the ether. None of the tentacles moved, and next morning those with the meat were still in the same position. After 48 hrs. one leaf seemed healthy, but the others were much injured.|$|E
60|$|The vapour {{of alcohol}} acts differently. A plant having three good leaves was left for 25 m. under a {{receiver}} holding 19 oz. with sixty minims of alcohol in a <b>watch-glass.</b> No movement ensued, but some {{few of the}} glands were blackened and shrivelled, whilst many became quite pale. These were scattered over all the leaves in the most irregular manner, reminding me of {{the manner in which}} the glands were affected by the vapour of carbonate of ammonia. Immediately on the removal of the receiver particles of raw meat were placed on many of the glands, those which retained their proper colour being chiefly selected. But not a single tentacle was inflected during the next 4 hrs. After the first 2 hrs. the glands on all the tentacles began to dry; and next morning, after 22 hrs., all three leaves appeared almost dead, with their glands dry; the tentacles on one leaf alone being partially inflected.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the ring method to the measurement of solutions of serum and of certain organic compounds has brought forth new facts, mainly the decrease of the surface tension of such solutions in function of time. 1. In serum diluted at such a low concentration as 1 : 1, 000, 000 in NaCl, physiological solution, the surface tension of the liquid is lowered by 3 or 4 dynes in 2 hours; at 1 : 100, 000, by about 11 dynes (mean value) in 2 hours, and by 20 dynes in 24 hours; at 1 : 10, 000 by about 13 to 16 dynes in 2 hours. 2. The drop in surface tension is much more rapid in the first 30 minutes and follows generally the law of adsorption in the surface layer in function of the time. 3. Stirring or shaking after the drop causes the surface tension to rise, but generally below its initial value. 4. The same phenomena occur when using sodium oleate, glycocholate, or saponin instead of serum. 5. For every serum, {{as well as for}} the substances mentioned above a maximum drop occurs in certain conditions at a given optimum concentration. 6. Not only are the substances which lower the surface tension adsorbed in the surface layer, in the case in which they are present with crystalloids, but also the crystalloids themselves, in contradiction to Gibbs' statement. This is plainly shown by the evaporation of such solutions in <b>watch-glasses</b> which, instead of a small group of sharp, large, well defined crystals at the bottom, leaves a white disc almost as large as the initial free surface itself, due to the liberation of the salt by the surface layer as it crawls down the concave surface of the glass. 7. In these conditions, solutions of serum are characterized by a very peculiar periodic and concentric distribution of the crystals, at a concentration of 1 : 100 only. The same ring-like aspect is observed with sodium oleate, glycocholate, and saponin, but not at the same concentration, as was to be expected, since serum is a solution in itself...|$|R
60|$|A second {{plant was}} left for only 5 m. with some alcohol in a <b>watch-glass,</b> under a 12-oz. receiver, and {{particles}} of meat were then {{placed on the}} glands of several tentacles. After 10 m. some of them began to curve inwards, and after 55 m. nearly all were considerably inflected; but a few did not move. Some anaesthetic effect is here probable, {{but by no means}} certain. A third plant was also left for 5 m. under the same small vessel, with its whole inner surface wetted with about a dozen drops of alcohol. Particles of meat were now placed on the glands of several tentacles, some of which first began to move in 25 m.; after 40 m. most of them were somewhat inflected, and after 1 hr. 10 m. almost all were considerably inflected. From their slow rate of movement {{there can be no doubt}} that the glands of these tentacles had been rendered insensible for a time by exposure during 5 m. to the vapour of alcohol.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time {{look at the}} change which {{has taken place in}} the water to which we have applied heat--it is losing its fluid state. You may tell this by two or three circumstances. I have covered the mouth of this glass flask, in which water is boiling, with a <b>watch-glass.</b> Do you see what happens? It rattles away like a valve chattering, because the steam rising from the boiling water sends the valve up and down, and forces itself out, and so makes it clatter. You can very easily {{perceive}} that the flask is quite full of steam, or else it would not force its way out. You see, also, that the flask contains a substance very much larger than the water, for it fills the whole of the flask over and over again, and there it is blowing away into the air; and yet you cannot observe any great diminution in the bulk of the water, which shews you that its change of bulk is very great when it becomes steam.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{experiments were}} tried {{during the summer}} of 1873, by placing the leaves, each in a separate <b>watch-glass</b> and pouring over it thirty minims (1.775 ml.) of the solution; other leaves being treated in exactly the same manner with the doubly distilled water used in making the solutions. The trials above given were made several years before, and when I read over my notes, I could not believe in the results; so I resolved to begin again with moderately strong solutions. Six leaves were first immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate to 8750 of water (1 gr. to 20 oz.), so that each received 1/320 of a grain (.2025 mg.). Before 30 m. had elapsed, four of these leaves were immensely, and two of them moderately, inflected. The glands were rendered of a dark red. The four corresponding leaves in water were not at all affected until 6 hrs. had elapsed, and then only the short tentacles on the borders of the disc; and their inflection, as previously explained, is never of any significance.|$|E
60|$|This {{simple method}} is often {{convenient}} for quickly noting {{the character of}} a finger pattern. The impression may be made on a window-pane, a <b>watch-glass,</b> or even an eye-glass, if nothing better is at hand. The impression is not seen to its fullest advantage except by means of a single small source of bright light. The glass or steel has to be so inclined as just not to reflect the light into the eye. That part of the light which falls on the oily impression is not so sharply reflected from it as {{from the surface of the}} glass or steel. Consequently some stray beams of the light which is scattered from the oil, reach the eye, while all of the light reflected from the highly-polished glass or steel passes in another direction and is unseen. The result is a brilliantly luminous impression on a dark background. The impression ceases to be visible when the glass or steel is not well polished, and itself scatters the light, like the oil.|$|E

The water here was constantly changing, a current flowing through it towards the sea. Then he brought up two or three more loads of wreckage and sat down under the awning, for it could scarcely be termed a tent, as both ends were open to allow a free passage for the air. Here he sat for some hours, occasionally getting up and looking over the sea to the right and left. It was not until it was nearly noon and the sun was overhead that he could try the experiment upon which he relied to obtain fire. When it was nearly vertical he went down to the well, opened his watch-case, and dipped the glass carefully into the water. He thought of trying to {{take it out of the}} case, but the risk of breaking it would have been too great.

60|$|The vapour {{produces}} a powerful {{effect on the}} glands, and induces inflection. Three plants with their roots in bottles, so that the surrounding air could not have become very humid, were placed under a bell-glass (holding 122 fluid ounces), together with 4 grains of carbonate of ammonia in a <b>watch-glass.</b> After an interval of 6 hrs. 15 m. the leaves appeared unaffected; but next morning, after 20 hrs., the blackened glands were secreting copiously, {{and most of the}} tentacles were strongly inflected. These plants soon died. Two other plants were placed under the same bell-glass, together with half a grain of the carbonate, the air being rendered as damp as possible; and in 2 hrs. most of the leaves were affected, many of the glands being blackened and the tentacles inflected. But it is a curious fact that some of the closely adjoining tentacles on the same leaf, both on the disc and round the margins, were much, and some, apparently, not in the least affected. The plants were kept under the bell-glass for 24 hrs., but no further change ensued. One healthy leaf was hardly at all affected, though other leaves on the same plant were much affected. On some leaves all the tentacles on one side, but not those on the opposite side, were inflected. I doubt whether this extremely unequal action can be explained by supposing that the more active glands absorb all the vapour as quickly as it is generated, so that none is left for the others, for we shall meet with [page 143] analogous cases with air thoroughly permeated with the vapours of chloroform and ether.|$|E

In deep nutrient agar, discrete, well-developed colonies can be obtained with regularity but their examination and removal can be difficult. This can be overcome by cultivating the microbes in a layer of agar contained between two plates of glass clamped on a U-shaped metal support (Mason, 1930). Unfortunately, because {{the edges of the}} agar are then exposed to air, contamination and shrinkage of the medium is the rule with this method.
