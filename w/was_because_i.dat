"The {{reason why}} I {{chose to do}} the {{recording}} in London this time <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make an album in a closed-off environment, {{sort of like a}} place where sunlight doesn't reach. The songs this time are like me. They're not liberal and open-minded. The songs which I've always made often share the same views and ideas as the listener, but this time, they're more like shouts and prayers from my individual innermost self. With this image, I've probably gotten closer to how I was like inside when I first debuted. What I do in America has always been liberal and open, so that's why I chose London this time instead..." ...|$|E
500|$|Fields edited Steven Spielberg's {{first major}} film, The Sugarland Express (1974). She became widely celebrated {{for her work}} as the film editor on Spielberg's next film, Jaws (1975), for which she won both the Academy Award for Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in 1976. Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets." [...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven told me it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had cut the first picture that was a monumental success {{in which you can}} really see the editing. And people discovered that it was a woman who edited Jaws." ...|$|E

500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Kunis {{comes from}} a Jewish family and has cited {{antisemitism}} in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States. She has stated that her parents [...] "raised [...] Jewish {{as much as they}} could," [...] although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: [...] "I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?" ...|$|E

500|$|Speer {{made himself}} widely {{available}} to historians and other enquirers. He did an extensive, in-depth interview for the June 1971 issue of Playboy magazine, {{in which he}} stated, [...] "If I didn't see it, then it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to see it." [...] In October 1973, Speer made {{his first trip to}} Britain, flying to London under an assumed name to be interviewed by Ludovic Kennedy on the BBC Midweek programme. Upon arrival, he was detained for almost eight hours at Heathrow Airport when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity. The Home Secretary, Robert Carr, allowed Speer into the country for 48 hours. In the same year he appeared in the television programme The World at War. While in London eight years later to participate in the BBC Newsnight program, Speer suffered a stroke and died on September1, 1981. Speer had formed a relationship with an Englishwoman of German origin, and was with her {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing. You have the gift, you have the soul, you have the spirit, you have the swagger ... you have the X Factor" [...] while Simon Cowell said: [...] "When I was asked by a lot of people why I was bringing this show to America, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hoped that we were going to find someone like you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fator says {{he found}} he {{had the ability to}} {{impersonate}} singers by practicing ventriloquism while driving his car.

He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who was I to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off.

2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical.

They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career.
