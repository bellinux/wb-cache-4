40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only <b>with</b> the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991 and 2000. An increase in M 1, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crises in 1993, 2000 and 2001...|$|R
50|$|Polymorphisms {{at sites}} 136, 154, and 171 <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> varying {{susceptibility}} to scrapie. Polymorphisms of the PrP-VRQ form and PrP-ARQ form <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> increased susceptibility, whereas PrP-ARR <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> resistance.|$|R
5|$|During 2005, {{the largest}} {{recorded}} epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> mutations in the rotavirus A genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlement}} of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> increased rates of erosion.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship {{is suggested by the}} fact that his funerary cult <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
2500|$|One may <b>associate</b> each divisor <b>with</b> the set {{of prime}} powers that divide it: thus, 12 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,3,4}, while 20 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,4,5}. Then 12∧20=4 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,3,4}∩{2,4,5}={2,4}, while 12∨20=60 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,3,4}∪{2,4,5}={2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet {{operations}} of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets.|$|R
50|$|Fish {{that are}} {{generally}} blackish <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the host anemone Stichodactyla mertensii, Mertens' carpet sea anemone.

Only orange or brown juveniles <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Heteractis aurora (beaded sea anemone).|$|R
5000|$|Porocephaliasis <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> {{contact with}} snakes. (This is in {{contrast}} <b>with</b> Linguatulosis, which <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> contact with dogs or wolves.) ...|$|R
5|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{the spider}} <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the goddess Neith in her aspect as spinner and weaver of destiny, this link {{continuing}} later through the Babylonian Ishtar and the Greek Arachne, who was later equated as the Roman goddess Minerva.|$|E
5|$|In Irish {{folklore}} and English folklore, the color was sometimes <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> witchcraft, and with faeries and spirits. The type of Irish fairy {{known as a}} leprechaun is commonly portrayed wearing a green suit, though before the 20th century he was usually described as wearing a red suit.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Classic, {{from around}} the 2nd century AD, the stela style that {{developed}} at Takalik Abaj and <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the portrayal of historic figures was adopted across the Maya lowlands, particularly in the Petén Basin.

T1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> finger abductors.|$|R
5|$|Joel Smilow {{became chief}} {{executive}} officer (CEO) of Playtex in 1969 and <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the company through five owners. The company was acquired by Esmark in 1975 for $210 million($ in modern dollars).|$|E
5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} opening, Ravenscroft {{appointed}} Robert Newman as manager. Newman {{had already had}} three different careers, as a stockjobber, a bass soloist, and a concert agent.

40|$|Sixty-one Burkholderia cepacia {{isolates}} {{from patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) and four plant isolates were screened for {{production of the}} siderophores salicylic acid (SA), pyochelin, cepabactin, and ornibactins and fingerprinted by a PCR-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. Of the 24 RAPD types determined, 22 (92 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced SA, 21 (87 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced ornibactins, 15 (60 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced pyochelin, and 3 (12 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced cepabactin.
