6000|$|The MS. of Lara is dated May 14, 1814. The opening lines, {{which were}} not prefixed to the {{published}} poem, and were first printed in Murray's Magazine (January, 1887), are {{of the nature of}} a Dedication. They <b>were</b> probably <b>written</b> {{a few days after the}} well-known song, [...] "I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name," [...] which was enclosed to Moore in a letter dated May 4, 1814. There can be little doubt that both song and dedication were addressed to Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster, and that Lara, like the Corsair and the Bride of Abydos, <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>con</b> amore, and because the poet was [...] "eating his heart away." ...|$|R
50|$|After leaving Invisible Records, Nocturne signed {{again with}} Triple X Records and began {{producing}} their third studio album. The album's themes deal with break-up and relationship, hinting at the 8 year-long relationship between lead singer Lacey Conner and Telkes, which ended shortly after beginning production for Guide to Extinction. The album's opening song <b>is</b> Shallow, <b>written</b> by Telkes, in which Conner's lyrics change harshly between screaming and emoting flirtatiously. The lead single I Lie <b>was</b> <b>written</b> by <b>Conner,</b> and its lyrics refer to relationships that go awry. The song is a Goth/Industrial metal record with some synthesizers and programming. Dirty Sanchez, Alibi and Passion all talk about break up, while songs like Class War and Dead Man are satirical {{criticisms of the}} government and actual politics.|$|R
