40|$|A {{new model}} system for mapping and {{forecasting}} nitrogen deposition to the Baltic Sea has been developed. The system {{is based on}} the Lagrangian variable scale transport-chemistry model ACDEP (Atmospheric Chemistry and Deposition model), and aims at delivering deposition estimates to be used as input to marine ecosystem models. The system is tested by comparison of model results to measurements from monitoring stations around the Baltic Sea. The comparison shows that observed annual mean ambient air concentrations and <b>wet</b> <b>depositions</b> are well reproduced by the model. Diurnal mean concentrations of NH x (sum of NH 3 and NH 4 +) and NO 2 are fairly well reproduced, whereas concentrations of total nitrate (sum of HNO 3 and NO 3 -) are somewhat overestimated. <b>Wet</b> <b>depositions</b> of nitrate and ammonia are fairly well described for annual mean values, whereas the discrepancy is high for the monthly mean values and the <b>wet</b> <b>depositions</b> are rather poorly described concerning the diurnal mean values. The model calculations show that the annual atmospheric nitrogen deposition has a pronounced south [...] north gradient with depositions in the range about 1. 0 T N km - 2 in the south and 0. 2 T N km - 2 in the north. The results show that in 1999 the maximum diurnal mean deposition to the Danish waters appeared during the summer in the algae growth season. For the northern parts of the Baltic the highest depositions were distributed over most of the year. Total deposition to the Baltic Sea was for the year 1999 estimated to 318 kT N for an area of 464 406 km 2 equivalent to an average deposition of 684 kg N/km 2...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{coherence}} or synchrony in {{the trends}} in SO 4 2 ? concentration {{in a set}} of 100 lakes in Norway that have a long-term chemical record was evaluated. Using a statistical technique that compares patterns or trends that are not uni-directional, the lakes were grouped into 18 subsets or clusters, each with between 2 and 11 lakes that had similar trends. These temporal trends were strongly correlated with several climate indices, notably the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) measured in the autumn, and the annual North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI). Because these clusters of lakes were spatially dispersed, they could not be compared directly with trends in <b>wet</b> S <b>deposition,</b> because S deposition varied substantially between lakes within each cluster. However, the average trend in SO 4 2 ? concentration was evaluated in each of 10 regions of Norway that were defined previously on the basis of pollution load, meteorological variables and biogeography. Although these regions did not match the statistically-selected clusters of lakes with equal trends very closely, there were similar, strong correlations between climate indices (the AOI and NAOI) and the 10 average SO 4 2 ? trends, although there were even stronger relationships with average <b>wet</b> S <b>deposition</b> in the regions.

40|$|Trend {{analysis}} and forecasting of time series data on air-pollutants {{is important to}} design effective measures to minimize damages to ecosystems and human health. In this study, autoregressive, moving average, autoregressive-moving average and autoregressive integrated moving average processes of different order were implemented to examine patterns of depositions and emissions. Analysis was undertaken to examine stationarity of the series or to design a method to create stationary series. The model that satisfied selected statistical criteria was chosen to make forecasts. Forecasts of depositions were compared with critical loads by watersheds. The {{findings of this study}} indicated that both <b>wet</b> <b>depositions</b> and emissions of SO 2 and NOx data exhibited non-stationarity. After removing non-stationarity, suitable time-series model was selected for short-run forecasting (1994 to 2005). The resulting depositions and emissions data were examined with respect to their long-run movement and critical deposition loadings. The analysis showed that excess <b>wet</b> <b>depositions</b> of SO 2 and NO 3 would be major problems at least for ten years. Most of these problems are observed in Atlantic Canada and few watersheds in Quebec and Ontario. Although emissions of SO 2 have declined, emissions of NOx remained unchanged or increased compared to the 1980 level. Considering the fact that these pollutants contribute to acidification, eutrophication and formation of secondary particulates that are hazardous to human health, it is necessary to find ways of further reducing emissions and depositions of these pollutants. While substantial progress has been made with respect to reduction of SO 2 emissions (especially in Canada), the analysis presented in this study indicated that there must be substantially more reductions to ensure the protection of sensitive ecosystems. Thus, evidences similar to those presented in this study should be gathered to initiate negotiations for reductions beyond the 2005 or 2010 commitments. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare 2 methods for measuring dry and <b>wet</b> atmospheric <b>depositions</b> in the urban environment, namely DAD and WAD (direct method) /TAD and WAD (indirect method). Trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pt and V) were used to carry out this comparison. TAD was collected with two open polyethylene containers (72 × 54 × 21 cm), while WAD was collected by means of an automated rainwater collector and DAD was determined from both air measurements (recorded by an air sampler) and 7 Be deposition velocities. This comparison showed a significant difference between the two methods. Dry and wet fluxes varied widely from one month to the next. Zn and Cu were the most abundant elements in both dry and <b>wet</b> <b>depositions.</b> The mean contribution of DAD to the total atmospheric deposition during this 9 -month study was significant for Zn, Cu and V (about 25 %) as well as for Pb (approx. 60 %). For this relatively unpolluted urban residential catchment, the contribution of atmospheric deposition to global load at the catchment outlet was low, between 10 % and 20 % for Zn, Cu, V and Pb, 25 % for Cr and about 30 % for Ni. For other urban sites exhibiting high atmospheric pollution however, the atmospheric contribution to the global pollution load could be much greater.
