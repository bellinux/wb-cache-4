500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed to Syco Music. Recording for their debut studio album, Up All Night, began in January 2011. In February 2011, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. [...] "Moments" [...] was written by Ed Sheeran and Si Hulbert, and produced by Hulbert. In an April 2012 interview with news.com.au, Sheeran said that he wrote the track [...] "years ago." [...] In 2011, Sheeran met One Direction's Harry Styles at his [...] "guitarist's friend's house". The group were putting their debut studio album together at the time. Sheeran had a CD with him of 40 songs {{that he was going}} to give to publishers. As the boy band did not have enough songs for their album, Sheeran told Styles, [...] "Here's a CD. If you <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these songs, have it." [...] The song ended up on the deluxe edition of the album. Sheeran acknowledged that he was happy with the outcome, [...] "It was a song I was never going to use. To have it on a multi-platinum selling album is quite nice." [...] During the album's UK launch in late 2011, member Louis Tomlinson referred to the song as his favourite track on the album. Niall Horan also commented, [...] "getting to write and record with Sheeran on our album was an honour." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Rod Smallwood, the band's manager, {{the brief}} given to Derek Riggs (the group's then regular artist) was, unlike with {{previous}} albums, to create [...] "simply something surreal and bloody weird". Riggs confirms that [...] "they {{said they wanted}} one of my surreal things. 'It's about prophecy and seeing into the future, and we <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your surreal things.' That was the brief ... I had a limited {{time to do the}} picture, and I thought it was pretty weird their concept, so I just went with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't <b>want.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{which of}} you will be staying here along with her, dears?" [...] said Matilda. [...] "She'll be <b>wanting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{you to be with}} her, any ways." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hirst {{said that}} he only painted five spot {{paintings}} himself because, [...] "I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it"; he described his efforts as [...] "shite"—"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel." [...] He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked {{for one of the}} paintings. Hirst told her to, [...] "'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'" [...] By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist: ...|$|E

'Now'--continued the old woman, with {{singular}} earnestness, yet smiling strangely {{at her own}} folly--'I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> you, my children--when {{your mother}} is dressed and in the coffin---I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> you to hold a looking-glass over my face.

6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those eggs," [...] muttered Blacky, as {{he settled}} himself in comfort {{on a certain}} {{particular}} spot on a certain particular branch of that tall pine-tree. Indeed, that particular branch might well be called the [...] "mischief branch," [...] for on it Blacky has thought out and planned most of the mischief he is so famous for. [...] "Yes, sir," [...] he continued, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those eggs, and what is more, I {{am going to have}} one." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{process was}} {{interrupted}} by an abrupt allocution from the conductor. [...] "I guess you change here for your place. You <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them blue cars." ...|$|E
50|$|Hamidullah later {{clarified}} {{in interviews}} {{that it was}} a closure more out of necessity than choice: she <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her daughters to take over, but neither obliged. As a result, her departure meant the end of the groundbreaking magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Duxie Zi (...) is a clan of assassins {{and also}} {{the name of the}} leader. Duxie means [...] "Venomous Scorpion." [...] It seems they hold people captive, ready to take them away. If someone <b>wants</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them, a price must be paid first.|$|R
6000|$|... "From Father Lucien," [...] said Scott, {{who took}} the folded paper. [...] "He's had a sick man on his hands {{for three or four}} days and <b>wants</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us to relieve him. I allow I'd sooner stop here. It's pretty fierce to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, {{when you}} write to-night," [...] Rosie said, [...] "please send her your {{photograph}} and ours, and say we all <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> our new relative that is to be." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the boys}} to take it. You can go along, if you wish," [...] went on James Monday. He was not quite willing to trust the old man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{already told}} Captain Tanner I <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those {{places at the}} north brook to-night. I don't intend to let you fellows do the work while I go and sleep. The women folks and the {{children}} {{are the only ones}} to take it easy." ...|$|R
5|$|Cromwell was {{a lawyer}} {{and a member of}} Parliament—a Protestant who saw how Parliament could be used to advance the Royal Supremacy, which Henry wanted, and to further Protestant beliefs and {{practices}} Cromwell and his friends <b>wanted.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> his closest friends was Thomas Cranmer, soon to be Archbishop.|$|R
25|$|When Starkad was so {{old that}} he wished to die and his {{eyesight}} was bad, he hung his gold {{around his neck and}} went out to wander.

6000|$|... "If you {{can afford}} to--yes," [...] she answered. [...] "But I <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two things. The first seems to scare you to death even to think of. The second is more money--a good deal more money." ...|$|E
50|$|Many critics {{regarded}} <b>Wanting</b> as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the best}} novels of the year.|$|R
6000|$|... “Why I {{suppose a}} fellow’s {{surprised}} at any <b>one’s</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his children. He sometimes feels {{the weight of}} that sort of thing so much, you know. He wonders what use on earth another man can make of them.” And Lord Canterville laughed pleasantly through the copious fringe of his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "N-no, he's not. In fact, he {{has more}} to do with spirits than bodies; but he <b>wants</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the latter--and I said I'd try to get him one--so, if you can help me, do so, like a good fellow. My friend is particular, however; he <b>wants</b> a man <b>one,</b> above six feet, thin and sallow, and with long black hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What will be {{the good}} of that?" [...] broke in Heron viciously. [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his accursed {{followers}} {{to be ready to}} give him a helping hand on the way if he tries to slip through our fingers? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon," [...] Mr. Barbo reflected, [...] "that you'll <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them Congregational boarding-houses.

60|$|HARRY. I don't {{hate and}} despise them. I think that's odious. But {{sometimes}} they're not very tactful. I don't know that I much <b>want</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my clerks {{to come and}} slap {{me on the back}} in the office and call me old chap.|$|E
50|$|This {{sparked the}} story, with Faraj {{looking for the}} money. However, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{neighbours}} disliked him because he <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his friends to rent the room. This made him hate Faraj and become suspicious of him. Faraj looked for the money, but couldn't find it, because there are four underground rooms and Assadi did not remember which one it was.|$|R
50|$|The family business, and his father’s success, made a large {{impression}} on Dino, {{and soon after}} he graduated high school he designed and created his own zip-up dress shirt.
