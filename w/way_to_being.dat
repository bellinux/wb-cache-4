Civilian losses were considerable, with 1,637 killed, 1,760 injured, and 50,000 homes destroyed or damaged. In comparison to The Blitz this was relatively minor; 30,000 civilians were killed and 50,000 injured {{by the end of}} that campaign. Luftwaffe losses were 40 bombers and 150 aircrew.

His drought in limited overs cricket has puzzled cricket experts because of the consistent performances in Test matches with a high scoring rate has not translated into significant contributions in the ODI format of the game. Sehwag was dropped from the ODI Squad for the WI-IND 4 Match ODI series. With debate over whether he deserved {{to be included in}} the 2007 Cricket World Cup squad, captain Dravid's insistence on his retention paved the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> named in the World Cup squad.

25|$|The Air Ministry still {{saw little}} {{immediate}} {{value in the}} effort (they regarded it as long-range research), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to build an experimental engine facility at a BTH factory in Rugby, Warwickshire. Work progressed quickly, {{and by the end}} of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were well on their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> completed, all within the original £2,000 budget. However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines (Herbert A.

25|$|Berthold took {{command of}} the big bomber. He left the Eindekker to Buddecke; this {{decision}} sped Buddecke on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> {{a member of the}} first wave of German aces that included Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Kurt Wintgens. Berthold knew he could cross the lines searching for opponents in the AEG G.II, while the Eindekker was ordered to patrol only behind German lines. However, Berthold damaged his original G.II in a landing accident on 15 September, and had to return to piloting an old two-seater. On 21 September 1915, Rudolf Berthold was promoted to Oberleutnant. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany to pick up a replacement G.II. By 1 October, he had it in action for bombing, as well as a gunship for air defense missions. On 6 November, one of those missions turned deadly; a British Vickers F.B.5 gunner mortally wounded Gruener. Berthold was depressed by his friend's death, and sent on home leave, vowing vengeance for Greuner's death.|$|E
