5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. <b>Whining</b> is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

40|$|The ocurrence of {{nonlinear}} vocal {{phenomena in}} frustration <b>whines</b> of the Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris) We analyzed quantitatively {{the occurrence of}} nonlinear vocal phenomena in <b>whines</b> of 9 Domestic Dogs of 6 breeds. The dogs produced <b>whines</b> {{in response to a}} frustration-provoking situation (impossibility to perform the desired action), designed with their owners. The <b>whines</b> could consist two fundamental frequencies – the low (f 0) and the high (g 0), that could occur both singly as separate vocalizations and together within the same vocalization. The f 0 varied between individuals from 0. 4 to 1. 4 kHz and either lacked nonlinear phenomena or bored deterministic chaos, subharmonics or frequency jumps within the f 0. The g 0 varied between individuals from 3. 1 to 11 kHz and also either lacked nonlinear phenomena or bored sidebands. The simultaneous occurrence of f 0 and g 0 within the same <b>whine</b> resulted in biphonation, whereas the f 0 following g 0 resulted in frequency jump between the fundamentals. We found, that in <b>whines</b> of our object dogs nonlinear phenomena occurred significantly more often within the f 0 than within the g 0, and significantly more rarely in <b>whines</b> consisting both f 0 and g 0 than in <b>whines</b> consisting f 0 or g 0 singly. The occurrence of nonlinear phenomena showed the noticeable interindividual variability. We discuss mechanisms for pro-duction of the f 0 and g 0 in the Domestic Dog. Also, we propose, that the strong variability in <b>whines</b> of Domestic Dogs has a function to attract attention of the dog owners in situation of frustration, when a dog can’t cope with a problem...|$|R
40|$|Empathy {{covers a}} wide range of {{phenomena}} varying according to the degree of cognitive complexity involved; ranging from emotional contagion, defined as the sharing of others' emotional states, to sympathetic concern requiring animals to have an appraisal of the others' situation and showing concern-like behaviors. While most studies have investigated how animals reacted in response to conspecifics' distress, dogs so far have mainly been targeted to examine cross-species empathic responses. To investigate whether dogs would respond with empathy-like behavior also to conspecifics, we adopted a playback method using conspecifics' vocalizations (<b>whines)</b> recorded during a distressful event as well as control sounds. Our subjects were first exposed to a playback phase where they were subjected either to a control sound, a familiar <b>whine</b> (from their familiar partner) or a stranger <b>whine</b> stimulus (from a stranger dog), and then a reunion phase where the familiar partner entered the room. When exposed to <b>whines,</b> dogs showed a higher behavioral alertness and exhibited more stress-related behaviors compared to when exposed to acoustically similar control sounds. Moreover, they demonstrated more comfort-offering behaviors toward their familiar partners following <b>whine</b> playbacks than after control stimuli. Furthermore, when looking at the first session, this comfort offering was biased towards the familiar partner when subjects were previously exposed to the familiar compared to the stranger <b>whines.</b> Finally, familiar <b>whine</b> stimuli tended to maintain higher cortisol levels while stranger <b>whines</b> did not. To our knowledge, these results are the first to suggest that dogs can experience and demonstrate "empathic-like" responses to conspecifics' distress-calls...|$|R

Crosby would later {{return to the}} game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2-1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky's suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: [...] "We're not going to <b>whine</b> here.

25|$|The stoat is a usually silent animal, but {{can produce}} a range of sounds {{similar to those of}} the least weasel. Kits produce a fine {{chirping}} noise. Adults trill excitedly before mating, and indicate submission through quiet trilling, <b>whining</b> and squealing. When nervous, the stoat hisses, and will intersperse this with sharp barks or shrieks and prolonged screeching when aggressive.|$|E

25|$|Due to the breed's stoic nature, {{injuries}} can {{go unnoticed}} {{for a time}} as the dog will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like <b>whining.</b> For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot {{a few days after}} the actual injury, so owners should be aware of their pets usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above.|$|E

Tennant also provides the narration and all the character voices for the audio book versions of the Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III stories by Cressida Cowell such as How to Train Your Dragon. In these audio books, he employs his vocal skills to create a vast cast of recognisably distinct voices. Some of his most memorable characterisations include the Norfolk yokel of Norbert the Nutjob, the broad Glaswegian of Gobber the Belch, the hissing and <b>whining</b> Cockney of Toothless the Dragon and the sly insinuations of Alvin the Treacherous.
