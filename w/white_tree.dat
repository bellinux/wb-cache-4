25|$|During the Battle for Minas Tirith, the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> of Gondor {{is shown}} to bear one white blossom, thus {{blooming}} by itself at Aragorn's coronation. Thereby the film ignores the book's story where Gandalf and Aragorn find a seedling of the <b>white</b> <b>tree</b> {{up in the mountains}} and plant in the courtyard in place of the still-dead tree.|$|E
25|$|In Isildur's youth, Númenor's King Ar-Pharazôn was {{corrupted}} by Sauron, who urged that Nimloth the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> be cut down. Isildur {{went to the}} court of the king in disguise and stole a fruit of the tree. He was severely wounded in his escape, but his sacrifice was not in vain: Nimloth was cut down and burned shortly afterward, but the line of the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> continued. When Númenor was destroyed by Ilúvatar, Elendil's family escaped in seven ships.|$|E
25|$|Some stylistic {{analyses}} {{consider the}} ultimate importance of Arnor is to {{stand as a}} literary device contrasting the southern kingdom of Gondor. Arguing that Arnor and Gondor {{are representative of the}} classical dichotomy of light and dark, blessed and forsaken, good and evil - these analyses reference the abandonment by the heirs of Valandil and the absence of a <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> as points of stylistic comparison to Gondor, with its fortresses and heavily populated capital city, its possession of a <b>White</b> <b>Tree,</b> and its well-equipped military and armaments.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Gandalf crowned Aragorn as King Elessar, {{and helped}} him find a sapling of the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> of Gondor. He {{accompanied}} the Hobbits back to {{the borders of the}} Shire, before leaving to visit Tom Bombadil.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of Elendil was the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> Nimloth with seven stars above it (representing {{each of the}} stars on the banners from the seven ships (of the nine ships that escaped the destruction of Númenor) that carried the palantíri), and above them a silver crown. This standard became the main symbol of royalty in Gondor.|$|E
25|$|Amandil, {{chief of}} the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of this. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion {{prepared}} to flee eastwards, taking with them a seedling of the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> of Númenor before Sauron destroyed it, and the palantíri, gifts of the elves. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down their guardianship {{of the world and}} called for Ilúvatar to intervene.|$|E

25|$|A line {{of unique}} trees similar in {{appearance}} to Telperion, {{except that they}} did not give light. The first of these was Galathilion of Tirion, from which were descended Celeborn of Tol Eressëa, Nimloth of Númenor and the <b>White</b> <b>Trees</b> of Gondor.|$|R

25|$|One main {{difference}} from the books {{can be seen in}} the heraldry of Gondor. In the books, the flag of Gondor under the Stewards was a plain white banner without device. In the movies, the flag of Gondor is the royal standard in various variations, including on a white field. The banners carried by Gondorian cavalry and infantry are black pennants, with the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> and three white stars.|$|E
25|$|Theodore David Sargent, {{professor}} of zoology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, published {{a critique of}} Kettlewell's work. Based on his experiments between 1965 and 1969, he concluded {{that it was not}} possible to reproduce Kettlewell's results, and said that birds showed no preference on moth on either black or <b>white</b> <b>tree</b> trunks. He suggested that Kettlewell had trained the birds to pick moths on tree trunks to obtain desired results.|$|E
25|$|The sacred plant haoma and {{the drink}} made from it. The {{preparation}} of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining <b>white</b> <b>tree</b> that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.|$|E

25|$|The Men who had {{remained}} faithful {{were given the}} island of Númenor, {{in the middle of}} the Great Sea, and there they established a great Kingdom; and the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> of Númenor was planted in the King's city of Armenelos; and it was said that while that tree stood in the King's courtyard, the reign of Númenor would yet last. The Elves were granted pardon for the sins of Fëanor, and were allowed to return home to the Undying Lands.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Sauron, {{the greater part of}} the army of Arnor {{returned}} home while Isildur stayed in Gondor for a year, restoring order and defining its boundaries. He planted the seedling of the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> in Minas Anor in memory of Anárion. As his brother's helm had been crushed during his death at Barad-dûr, Isildur left his own helm as Gondor's crown. He installed Anárion's son Meneldil as King of Gondor, and returned north en route to Arnor with his three sons. He made first for Rivendell, where his wife and fourth son Valandil had stayed behind throughout the War of the Last Alliance.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} the Citadel, the {{exterior}} of {{which was in the}} Stone Street Studios backlot, using forced perspective. It contains the withered <b>White</b> <b>Tree,</b> built from polystyrene by Brian Massey and the Greens Department with real branches, influenced by ancient and gnarled Lebanese olive trees. The interior was within a three-story former factory in Wellington, and colour wise is influenced by Charlemagne's Chapel, with a throne for Denethor carved from stone and polystyrene statues of past Kings. The Gondorian armour is designed to represent an evolution from the Númenóreans of the first film's prologue, with a simplified sea bird motif. 16th-century Italian and German armour served as inspiration, while civilians wear silver and blacks as designed by Ngila Dickson, continuing an ancient/medieval Mediterranean Basin look.|$|E

25|$|In Minas Tirith, Faramir and Éowyn {{meet in the}} Houses of Healing {{and fall}} in love with each other, with Éowyn {{choosing}} to eschew any further hopes of glory with Aragorn. Aragorn comes to Minas Tirith and is crowned King of Gondor outside the walls of the city in a celebration during which Frodo brings Aragorn the ancient crown of Gondor, and Gandalf places the crown on Aragorn. A healed Faramir is appointed Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond—who saved Faramir's life from the madness of Denethor—is named captain of Faramir's guard. Gandalf and Aragorn go off high above the city and find a seedling of the <b>White</b> <b>Tree,</b> which Aragorn then plants in Minas Tirith in place of the dead tree. Soon after, Arwen, daughter of Elrond of Rivendell, as well as Celeborn and Galadriel come to Minas Tirith, and Aragorn marries Arwen.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Tolkien {{gathered}} {{that originally}} his father imagined {{only two or}} three centuries between the first fall of Sauron and the War of the Ring, foreseeing no complicated events to have happened during this time. With the progress of the narrative during 1941–2 to the breaking of the Fellowship and the war in Rohan, particular aspects in the history and culture of the South-kingdom were introduced one by one: alliance with the Rohirrim and ceding a province to them, in gratitude for their help in the first war with Sauron; the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> and the winged crown, at first just as vague images in Aragorn's song; the spelling Gondor; and the Palantíri, with Hornburg and Isengard made into former Gondor fortresses and sites of two out of five Stones in the South-kingdom. At a later point, the fifth palantír was imagined to have been at Erech, before being discarded overall.|$|E
25|$|In December 1933, Rivera {{returned}} to Mexico, and he repainted Man at the Crossroads in 1934 in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. This surviving version was called Man, Controller of the Universe. On June 5, 1940, invited again by Pflueger, Rivera returned {{for the last}} time to the United States to paint a ten-panel mural for the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Pan American Unity was completed November 29, 1940. As he was painting, Rivera was on display in front of Exposition attendees. He received US$1,000 per month and US$1,000 for travel expenses. The mural includes representations of two of Pflueger's architectural works as well as portraits of Kahlo, woodcarver Dudley C. Carter, and actress Paulette Goddard, who is depicted holding Rivera's hand as they plant a <b>white</b> <b>tree</b> together. Rivera's assistants on the mural included the pioneer African-American artist, dancer, and textile designer Thelma Johnson Streat. The mural and its archives reside at City College of San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|Many frogs have webbed {{feet and}} the degree of webbing is {{directly}} proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water.

25|$|In 1636 the Great Plague {{claimed the}} life of the King of Gondor, and {{withered}} its <b>White</b> <b>Tree.</b> The plague spread north along the Great Road that joined the two kingdoms, and the population of Minhiriath was decimated. About this time the plague also wiped out the Dúnedain hiding in the Barrow-downs and evil spirits came to dwell there. When King Araval attempted to resettle Cardolan two centuries later, the settlers were killed and driven off by the wights. What few folk survived could offer little aid to Arthedain in 1974, when Angmar overwhelmed the last of the kingdoms of Arnor. Until the end of the Third Age, the Dúnedain of Cardolan were only a memory, their tombs and barrows haunted by the evil wights sent from Angmar; for the Rangers that wandered over the lands were descended from the people of Arthedain. Tharbad survived until it was destroyed by floods in 2912.|$|E
25|$|In The Return of the King, Aragorn used a palantír and {{revealed}} himself to Sauron as the heir of Isildur, {{in order to}} distract Sauron's attention from Frodo, who was approaching Mordor, and to draw Sauron forth from Mordor. Sauron subsequently made his assault on Minas Tirith prematurely and without adequate preparation. In order to reach the city in time to defend it, Aragorn entered the Paths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the heir of Isildur. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned to pay their debt for betraying Gondor millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated {{at the port of}} Pelargir. Aragorn then sailed up the Anduin to Minas Tirith with a small force of Rangers and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions of Gondor. As they approached Minas Tirith, Aragorn unfurled the royal standard that Arwen had made for him, showing both the <b>White</b> <b>Tree</b> of Gondor and the jewelled crown and seven stars of the House of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Gondor and Rohan rallied and defeated Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.|$|E
