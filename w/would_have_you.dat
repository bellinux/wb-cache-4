25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> {{believe that if}} there was an {{over-production}} of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E

In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Siskel wrote that [...] "Parker seems more concerned with style and with hiding the film's big mystery than with pacing."

Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if {{he would like to}} come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. [...] "As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled Welles. [...] "And Kane <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> know.

Neil Strauss, {{a writer for}} The New York Times, {{described}} [...] "Is It Scary" [...] as [...] "sounding more like the ghoulish rocker Marilyn Manson than the Motown prodigy that he is." [...] A longtime commentator on Jackson's public life, J. Randy Taraborrelli, gave a retrospective analysis on Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs critical reviews in the biography, The Magic & the Madness (2004). Taraborrelli argued that certain sections of the world took interest in tabloid stories about Jackson's personal life over his musical career.|$|E
500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E

The house's owner was a flight attendant who frequently met cast and crew members as they traveled in and out of Vancouver. The initial scene with Duchovny and Anderson in the bar was shot at a Vancouver restaurant called The Meat Market, which according to Carter was a much [...] "divier location than the production designers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe". The Meat Market was the only bar the crew could find that had not been renovated in the wake of Expo 86 and retained a [...] "well-travelled" [...] feel. It later appeared in the third season episode [...] "Piper Maru". The roadside diner used for interior shots of the [...] "Flying Saucer Diner" [...] was remote enough from the other filming locations that a bus was made available to transport crew members, to save on travel expenses. Only key grip Al Campbell made use of this bus service, causing producers to abandon the idea until the fourth season episode [...] "Herrenvolk".|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic {{initially}} {{seems to}} need no defense, given its success, {{it is considered}} a film [...] "for 15-year-old girls" [...] by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too." ...|$|E
500|$|Willis {{built up}} his {{reputation}} in the public {{at a time when}} readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the [...] "high life" [...] of the [...] "Upper Ten Thousand", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as Pencillings by the Way and Dashes at Life With Free Pencil, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you...</b> indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced Margaux". When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.|$|E

500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn't know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E

[...] He wrote that [...] "Losts tradition of opening the year with a killer, capture-the-imagination sequence is honored and upheld, though the thing I loved most was how it was brazenly frank (and engagingly funny) about the heady high-concept conceit that will define the season." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. [...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that [...] "the opening scene itself will leave your mouth wide open and you'll probably forget to close it for a few minutes." [...] He also wrote the premiere episodes [...] "are vintage Lost, full of some unbelievable twists and a whole lot of groundwork". [...] H.T.

"Altman was {{a genuine}} movie maverick," [...] states author Ian Freer, because he went against the {{commercial}} conformity of the movie industry: [...] "He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> believe."
