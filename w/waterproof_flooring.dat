25|$|The add-on side tent {{underwent}} a complete redesign. The new model (referred to in publicity materials as an Add-a-Room tent or a Motent) superficially resembles the late Split-windshield's framed tent in general shape and colors, but is otherwise quite different. For one, the tent's frame is now external, with the canvas supported by elastic loops and plastic hooks, somewhat like a shower curtain. Instead {{of a single}} opening front panel, there is a zippered screen door {{in the middle of}} the front (side away from the bus) with a small awning flap that can be lowered for wind and rain protection. This tent also features a <b>waterproof</b> <b>floor,</b> and the attachment method on the vehicle side results in a securely closable shelter (i.e., no more gap below the bus floor).|$|R

60|$|Alpine Tent.--Mr. Whymper {{contrived}} a tent for his alpine explorations, {{which he}} found eminently successful. It has a <b>waterproof</b> <b>floor,</b> continuous with the sides: it {{is supported by}} poles, that slip into hems of the cloth--two poles at either end. These tents have been used on various occasions by Mr. Whymper's brother in Alaska, and by Mr. Freshfield in the Caucasus, and were highly approved of, but I {{do not know whether}} these tents would be altogether suitable for more comfortable travel. I myself had a tent made on this principle some years ago, but disliked it, for I found the continuity of the floor with the sides to act unsatisfactorily; the tent retained the damp, and the weight of the body, acting {{on the floor of the}} tent, was apt to disturb its walls. Mr. Whymper's tent is procurable at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter, 295, Oxford Street, London.|$|R

5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a <b>waterproof</b> <b>floor,</b> {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|R
30|$|The {{program has}} {{successfully}} provided millions of poor South Africans with homes, but has also faced challenges. In many instances settlements {{are built on}} marginal land. As Huchzermeyer (2003, p. 130) argues, housing projects “perpetuate segregation by income group, allocating the most disadvantaged urban/peri-urban locations to the poorest sectors of society […] in places where no high income earner will wish to locate.” Dwellings have also been criticized for being poorly designed and constructed and badly finished (Gilbert 2004; Smith 2008; Bolnick 2009; Charlton 2009; Tomlinson 2011). Most pertinent to the flooding issue, dwellings frequently show structural flaws, lack basic weatherproofing, and are prone to leaks. Studies highlight problems, such as large, visible cracks, dampness, the absence of plastering (Govender et al. 2011; Ntema n.d.), poorly laid and inadequately <b>waterproofed</b> <b>floor</b> slabs (Ngxubaza 2010), and poor ventilation and thermoregulation (Aigbavboa and Thwala 2011). Data from Statistics South Africa’s 2011 General Household Survey (Statistics South Africa 2011) also highlights problems, particularly in the Western Cape. One out of three households living in subsidized housing in the province reported that their roofs (32  %) and walls (32  %) were “weak” or in need of minor repairs (both 32  %).|$|R

40|$|An {{elevated}} <b>waterproof</b> access <b>floor</b> system having subfloor channels or compartments {{for power}} lines, gas lines {{or the like}} is adapted such {{that it can be}} opened and subsequently resealed without destroying the waterproofing and without destroying its aesthetic appearance. A multiplicity of tiles are supported on a support grid, and a flooring sheet is supported on the tiles. Attachment means are provided to prevent lateral but not vertical movement of the flooring sheet with respect to the tiles so that the flooring sheet can be lifted off the tiles, but when the flooring sheet is supported on the tiles, no lateral slipping will occur. The flooring sheet is made of a heat resealable material, {{so that it can be}} cut away in sections, and the tiles therebelow lifted off, to provide access to subfloor compartments...|$|R
50|$|The mill {{was always}} worked by millers named Lowe or John Webb, thus gaining its names. The mill was last worked commercially in 1910. The mill was disused for {{over twenty years}} until the Thaxted Civic Trust carried out {{essential}} repairs and made the structure <b>waterproof.</b> The lower <b>floors</b> were used as a scout hut. The mill passed into the ownership of Thaxted Parish Council in the 1950s. The Thaxted Society, formed in 1964, {{has been instrumental in}} the restoration of the mill to full working order.|$|R
5000|$|Truscon {{laboratories}} waterproofing protection {{products were}} for residential housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, and manufacturing plants. They involved enamels and interior finishes. The products were coatings {{to provide a}} dustless waterproof washable surface for cement floors and walls. The Truscon laboratories slogan was Waterproof is Weatherproof. Some of the brand names of these specialized products were Asepticote, Sno-Wite, Industrial Enamel, Hospital Enamel, Dairy Enamel, Floor Finish, Edelweiss and Alkali-Proof Wall Size. Its Asepticote waterproofing product was used in houses, hospitals, and hotels for its eye-soothing finish. Truscon's [...] "Waterproofing Paste" [...] {{was an integral part}} of cement and used in floors, plaster, and stucco to <b>waterproof</b> walls and <b>floors.</b> [...] "Industrial White" [...] was used in the interiors of mills and factories because of its white brightness qualities. Truscon's [...] "Granatex Floor Varnish", a stain-resistant product, was a transparent waterproofing agent that was used on concrete and wood floors.|$|R
50|$|The same {{principles}} of access {{that apply to}} public buildings also apply to private homes and may be required as part of local building regulations. Important adaptations include external access, providing sufficient space for a wheelchair user to move around the home, doorways that are wide enough for convenient use, access to upper floors, where they exist, which can be provided either by dedicated wheelchair lifts, {{or in some cases}} by using a stairlift to transfer between wheelchairs on different floors, and by providing accessible bathrooms with showers and/or bathtubs that are designed for accessibility. Accessible bathrooms can permit the use of mobile shower chairs or transfer benches to facilitate bathing for people with disabilities. Wet rooms are bathrooms where the shower floor and bathroom floor are one continuous <b>waterproof</b> surface. Such <b>floor</b> designs allow a wheelchair user using a dedicated shower chair, or transferring onto a shower seat, to enter the shower without needing to overcome a barrier or lip.|$|R
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} [...] "Dolphinarium" [...] {{experiment}} was to teach dolphins human language. Over {{a period of two}} years, Lilly and Howe Lovatt, both with very different approaches, tried to prove that human language could be mimicked by dolphins. During the experiment Howe Lovatt reasoned that the lessons could be more successful if she would spend day and night with her dolphins. So she began completely <b>waterproofing</b> the upper <b>floors</b> of the lab so that she could actually flood the indoor rooms and an outdoor balcony with a couple of feet of water. This would allow a dolphin to live comfortably in the building with her for three months. As Howe Lovatt and the pubescent male dolphin Peter were spending all their time together in the isolated [...] "Dolphinarium", in week five Peter started to exhibit signs of sexual attraction toward Howe Lovatt. As Peter's frequent arousal and courtship behavior were proving too disruptive to Howe Lovatt's training, she chose to relieve his urges herself manually.|$|R

40|$|Tijekom lipnja 2012. nastavljena su istraživanja na rimskoj vili smještenoj u uvali Soline otoka Sveti Klement zapadno od grada Hvara (otoka Hvara). Tri sonde istražene su do živca, a izvršeno je i kraće podmorsko rekognosciranje plitke uvale uz lokalitet, uz mjerenje pregradnih zidova solane te šireg dijela uvale Soline. In June of 2012, the {{investigations}} of the Roman villa located in Soline Bay {{on the island of}} St. Clement (Sv. Klement near Hvar) continued in their six season. Researchers from four institutions (Hvar Heritage Museum, Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb, University of St. Thomas, Minneapolis, Institute of Archaeology at the University of Graz) collaborated on the project, with a number of student and volunteer participants. Three probes on parcel 4319 were excavated to the bedrock: 7, 8 and 10. Probe 7 was an expansion of Probe 6 from 2011, where stratigraphic units 700 - 731 were documented. The wall (SU 717) of E-W direction, presumed in the magnetometric survey from 2010 was now archaeologically documented, along with its original floor (SU 719, 721), both of which are connected with the Late Roman villa. Another mortar floor with two foundations in chipped stones (SU 712, 713, 715) was documented above, testifying to a later reconstruction of the villa, of a so far undetermined date. Probe 8 was an expansion of Probe 4 from 2011, where stratigraphic units 800 - 825 were documented. The continuation of the N-S wall (SU 812) was documented in its foundations, that with the partially recovered parallel wall {{on the west side of}} the trench (SU 819) enclosed the Late Roman room within the villa. The continuation (from trench 4 excavated in 2011) of the thick Roman <b>waterproof</b> mortar <b>floor</b> (SU 817) abutting the wall foundation (SU 818) was documented in its overall dimensions. On the south side of the trench SU 815 and SU 816, there are probably the remains of a small grave. Archaeological evidence for the earlier Roman walls, indicated by the magnetometry results were not documented. The area of Novak‘s trench from the 1950 s was carefully cleaned, and two small probes were opened on the N (9) and S (10) edges of it. Probe 9 yielded architectural remains continuing in the S, E, and W direction. A bronze Roman coin was documented within the remains of the wall. Probe 10 documented stratigraphic units from 1000 - 1006. A floor (SU 1001), made of ceramic tiles dim. 35 x 35 cm, on the mortar foundation (SU 1002), and a thin burned layer was documented. The Soline bay was subjected to the underwater survey for the purpose of beginning the documentation and protection of the underwater architectural and material findings...|$|R
