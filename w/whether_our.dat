25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that we could not infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha {{released}} a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{issue in}} the study of the emotion-memory relationship is <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> emotions are influenced by our behavioral reaction to them, and whether this reaction—in the form of expression or suppression of the emotion—might affect what we remember about an event. Researchers have begun to examine whether concealing feelings influences our ability to perform common cognitive tasks, such as forming memories, and found that the emotion regulation efforts do have cognitive consequences. In the seminal work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins." ...|$|E

No one in Russia desired a war. The disastrous consequences of the Russo-Japanese War had shown the grave danger which Russia would run in case of hostilities.

If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.|$|E

2500|$|In humans, {{the lips}} are {{important}} {{for the production of}} stops and fricatives, in addition to vowels. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in tarsiers, monkeys and apes (the haplorhines) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the rhinarium or [...] "wet nose" [...] was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. [...] "Hence", according to one major authority, [...] "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines". It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.|$|E
2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, <b>whether</b> <b>our</b> plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E
