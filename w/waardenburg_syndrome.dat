50|$|<b>Waardenburg</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} genetic disorder. Its {{symptoms}} include deafness, minor defects, and abnormalities in pigmentation. Mutations in the MITF gene {{have been found in}} certain patients with <b>Waardenburg</b> <b>syndrome,</b> type II. Mutations that change the amino acid sequence of that result in an abnormally small MITF are found. These mutations disrupt dimer formation, and as a result cause insufficient development of melanocytes. The shortage of melanocytes causes some of the characteristic features of <b>Waardenburg</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{connection}} between albinism and deafness is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin observed that [...] "cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf". In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur {{together in the}} rare <b>Waardenburg's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> predominantly observed among the Hopi in North America. The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. It {{is interesting to note}} that similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin per se does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function. Instead the absence of melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in cochlear impairment, though why this is, is not fully understood.|$|R

40|$|Melanin {{protects the}} skin and eyes from {{the harmful effects of}} UV irradiation, protects neural cells from toxic insults, and is {{required}} for sound conduction in the inner ear. Aberrant regulation of melanogenesis underlies skin disorders (melasma and vitiligo), neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s disease), auditory disorders (<b>Waardenburg’s</b> <b>syndrome),</b> and opthalmologic disorders (age related macular degeneration). Much of the core synthetic machinery driving melanin production has been identified; however, the spectrum of gene products participating in melanogenesis in different physiological niches is poorly understood. Functional genomics based on RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) provides the opportunity to derive unbiased comprehensive collections of pharmaceutically tractable single gene targets supporting melanin production. In this study, we have combined a high-throughput, cell-based, one-well/one-gene screening platform with a genome-wide arrayed synthetic library of chemically synthesized, small interfering RNAs to identify novel biological pathways that govern melanin biogenesis in human melanocytes. Ninety-two novel genes that support pigment production were identified with a low false discovery rate. Secondary validation and preliminary mechanistic studies identified a large panel of targets tha...|$|R
40|$|<b>Waardenburg's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WS) is an {{autosomal}} dominant combination of deafness and pigmentary disturbances, probably caused by defective {{function of the}} embryonic neural crest. We have mapped one gene for WS to the distal part of chromosome 2. On {{the basis of their}} homologous chromosomal location, their close linkage to an alkaline phosphatase gene, and their related phenotype, we suggested that WS and the mouse mutant Splotch might be homologous. Splotch is caused by mutation in the mouse Pax- 3 gene. This gene is one of a family of eight Pax genes known in mice which are involved in regulating embryonic development; each contains a highly conserved transcription control sequence, the paired box. Here we show that some families with WS have mutations in the human homologue of Pax- 3. Mutations in a related gene, Pax- 6, which, like Pax- 3, has both a paired box and a paired-type homeobox sequence, cause the Small-eye mutation in mice and aniridia in man. Thus mutations in the Pax genes are important causes of human developmental defects...|$|R

40|$|The {{genetics}} of both syndromic (SHL) and non-syndromic {{hearing loss}} (NSHL) {{is characterized by}} a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. We analyzed whole exome sequencing data of 102 unrelated probands with apparently NSHL without a causative variant in known NSHL genes. We detected five causative variants in different SHL genes (SOX 10, MITF, PTPN 11, CHD 7, and KMT 2 D) in five (4. 9 %) probands. Clinical re-evaluation of these probands shows that some of them have subtle syndromic findings, while none of them meets clinical criteria for the diagnosis of the associated <b>syndrome</b> (<b>Waardenburg</b> (SOX 10 and MITF), Kallmann (CHD 7 and SOX 10), Noonan/LEOPARD (PTPN 11), CHARGE (CHD 7), or Kabuki (KMT 2 D).

40|$|Ophthalmo-acromelic {{syndrome}} (OAS), {{also known}} as <b>Waardenburg</b> Anophthalmia <b>syndrome,</b> {{is defined by the}} combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, with post-axial oligosyndactyly. Homozygosity mapping and subsequent targeted mutation analysis of a locus on 14 q 24. 2 identified homozygous mutations in SMOC 1 (SPARC-related modular calcium binding 1) in eight unrelated families. Four of these mutations are nonsense, two frame-shift, and two missense. The missense mutations are both in the second Thyroglobulin Type- 1 (Tg 1) domain of the protein. The orthologous gene in the mouse, Smoc 1, shows site- and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. We also report a targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc 1 (Smoc 1 (tm 1 a)) that reduces mRNA to ∼ 10 % of wild-type levels. This gene-trap results in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly in homozygous mutant animals (Smoc 1 (tm 1 a/tm 1 a)). Eye malformations, most commonly coloboma, and cleft palate occur in a significant proportion of Smoc 1 (tm 1 a/tm 1 a) embryos and pups. Thus partial loss of Smoc- 1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the human disease. SMOC- 1 is one of the two mammalian paralogs of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic. The orthologous gene in Xenopus laevis, Smoc- 1, also functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mic...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature and}} prevalence of ophthalmological findings for a cohort of children in a paediatric cochlear implant program and to assist the clinician in devising an investigative plan for this population. Retrospective medical record review of children who underwent multichannel cochlear implantation at a tertiary care hospital between February 1996 and July 2008. In all, 141 children (mean age 28 months, range 16 months to 9 years) had complete medical record documentation consisting of orthoptic and opthalmological examination, including cycloplegic refraction. A total of 59 children (41. 8 %) had ocular abnormalities with refractive errors being the most common abnormality. Hypermetropia {{was the most common}} refractive error and was found in 21 children (14. 8 %). Strabismus was found in six patients, with constant esotropia being the most common. Ocular pathology (excluding refractive or muscle abnormalities) were found in nine patients (6. 3 %). Three patients had syndromes associated with ocular findings including <b>Waardenburg</b> and Usher <b>syndrome.</b> During the follow-up period, 14 children were fitted with prescription lenses, 3 had strabismus surgery, and 2 underwent ptosis. Routine orthoptic and ophthalmologic examination can be beneficial in the initial evaluation of children assessed for cochlear implants. Electroretinography is useful in evaluating children with unexplained congenital sensorineural hearing loss, suggestive symptoms including night blindness, unexplained reduction in visual acuity, or delayed motor milestones.
