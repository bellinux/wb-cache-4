5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies <b>were</b> <b>everywhere</b> abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.

25|$|In 1822, a bill {{to authorize}} the {{collection}} of tolls on the Cumberland Road (which provided for yearly improvements to the road) was vetoed by the President.

Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it could not undertake the construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country.

[...] She was still photogenic, but so thin that she was sometimes described as [...] "frail" [...] or [...] "waiflike", and her husband sometimes worried about her weight. [...] She issued a half-hour campaign film that featured endorsements from many national and state party leaders {{as well as from}} celebrities Bob Hope and Art Linkletter, and showcased her family role and her concern for disadvantaged people. [...] Huber, in contrast, emphasized his edge in political experience, derided her [...] "motherly concern", and criticized the [...] "bossism" [...] that he said was trying to force another Romney into statewide office.|$|E

500|$|The 5th-century {{historian}} Zosimus strongly criticised {{the establishment}} of the large comitatus, accusing Constantine of wrecking his predecessor Diocletian's work of strengthening the border defences: [...] "By the foresight of Diocletian, the frontiers of the Roman empire <b>were</b> <b>everywhere</b> studded with cities and forts and towers... and the whole army was stationed along them, so it was impossible for the barbarians to break through... But Constantine ruined this defensive system by withdrawing the majority of the troops from the frontiers and stationing them in cities which did not require protection." [...] Zosimus' critique is probably excessive, both because the comitatus already existed in Diocletian's time and because some new regiments were raised by Constantine for his expanded comitatus, as well as incorporating existing units. Nevertheless, the majority of his comitatus was drawn from existing frontier units. This drawdown of large numbers of the best units inevitably increased the risk of successful large-scale barbarian breaches of the frontier defences.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{was a hit}} for Fox Broadcasting Company {{from the}} start and the network {{instantly}} received hundreds of requests from sellers wanting to create merchandise based on the show, such as clothing, alarm clocks, bubble gum, notebooks, posters, and air fresheners. The merchandise was highly successful, generating an estimated US$750 million in revenue {{during the first year}} of sales. As commented by AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny, [...] "an LP proved inevitable" [...] when, after the series premiere, [...] "the characters' licensed images <b>were</b> <b>everywhere</b> from T-shirts to action figures". In 1990, David Geffen, founder of the record label Geffen Records, decided to record an album featuring characters from The Simpsons. His idea was approved by Fox and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, and the show's writers were assigned to write original, humorous lyrics for the cast members to perform. The finished result became the hip-hop blues album The Simpsons Sing the Blues, released in December 1990. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 1991.|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They <b>were</b> <b>everywhere</b> on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E
