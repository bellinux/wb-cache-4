2500|$|Later {{randomized}} controlled trials trials {{failed to find}} any improvement in survival, For example, in a trial of the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with either cisplatin and vinblastine or these drugs plus hydrazine sulfate, saw complete tumor regression in 4% of the hydrazine group, versus 3% in the control group, and tumor progression in 36% of the hydrazine group, versus 30% of the control group; however, none of these differences <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> Some trials even found both significantly decreased survival and significantly poorer {{quality of life in}} those patients receiving hydrazine sulfate. These consistently negative results have resulted in hydrazine sulfate being described as a [...] "disproven cancer therapy" [...] in a recent medical review.

[...] between {{the years of}} 1988 and 1991 has found a correlation between Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates (TSP) and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing. A group of 74,671 pregnant women, in four separate regions of Beijing, were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of Sulfur Dioxide and TSP (along with other particulates). [...] The estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g for every 100µg/m3 increase in SO2 and 6.9g for each 100µg/m3 increase in TSP. These associations <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> in both summer and winter, although, summer was greater. The proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution, was 13%. This is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight. Coal stoves, which are in 97% of homes, are {{a major source of}} air pollution in this area.|$|E

2500|$|A {{critical}} review of 14 cases where VAN claimed 10 successes showed only one case where an earthquake occurred within the prediction parameters. The VAN predictions not only {{fail to do}} better than chance, but show [...] "a much better association with the events which occurred before them", according to Mulargia and Gasperini. Other early reviews found that the VAN results, when evaluated by definite parameters, <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> Both positive and negative views on VAN predictions from this period were summarized in the 1996 book [...] "A Critical Review of VAN" [...] edited by Sir James Lighthill and in a debate issue presented by the journal Geophysical Research Letters that was focused on the statistical significance of the VAN method. VAN had the opportunity to reply to their critics in those review publications. In 2011, the ICEF reviewed the 1996 debate, and concluded that the optimistic SES prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.|$|E
2500|$|One study {{published}} in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol concluded that high doses (0.28mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average [...] man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%.|$|E

Specifically, there <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> decreases in one measure of electoral competition - the winner's margin of victory - in legislative races in both states. However, GAO could not directly attribute these decreases to the programs due to other factors, such as the popularity of candidates, which affect electoral outcomes. We found no change in two other measures of competition, and there were no observed changes in voter choice - the average number of legislative candidates per district race. In Maine, decreases in average candidate spending in House races <b>were</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> but a state official said this was likely due to reductions in the amounts given to participating candidates in 2008, while average spending in Maine Senate races did not change. In Arizona, average spending has increased in the five elections under the program. There is no indication the programs decreased perceived interest group influence." ...|$|E
