"I {{also found}} my three nieces at Elmhurst, and {{it struck me}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to study their characters; for like Jane I had a fortune to leave behind me, and I was curious {{to find out which}} girl was the most deserving. No one {{suspected}} my disguise.

I went more slowly, and at last I stopped and sat down under the shade of a way-side tree. I thought for a few minutes, and then I said to myself, [...] "It seems to me this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to take one of those capsules," [...] and I took one.

"That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> indeed, Sir Thomas," [...] {{the queen}} said, with a smile; [...] "but methinks there is but {{little chance of}} its coming about, for at present {{it seems to me}} that the vassals are better able to make or unmake kings, than kings are able to deprive the great vassals of power; and never since Norman William set foot in England were they more {{powerful}} than they are at present. What does my chance of recovering our throne rest upon? Not upon our right, but on the quarrel between Warwick and the House of Rivers. We are but puppets that the great lords play against each other. Did it depend upon my will, it should be as you say; I would crush them all at a blow. Then only should I feel really a queen. But that is but a dream that can never be carried out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know your}} doctrine. But I mean the Last Day. We {{ought to have}} {{something}} in anticipation of it, here, in our social system. Character is a superstition, a wretched fetish. Once a year wouldn't be too often to seize upon sinners whose blameless life has placed them above suspicion, and turn them inside out before the community, so as to show people how the smoke of the Pit had been quietly blackening their interior. That would destroy character as a cult." [...] He laughed again. [...] "Well, this isn't business,--though it isn't pleasure, either, exactly. What I came for was to ask you something. I've finished at the Law School, and I'm just ready to begin here in the office with you. Don't you think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> for me {{to give up the}} law? Wait a moment!" [...] he said, arresting in Atherton an impulse to speak. [...] "We will take the decent surprise, the friendly demur, the conscientious scruple, for granted.

60|$|Luckily Hayward's letters came seldom, {{and in the}} {{intervals}} Philip settled down again to his industrious life. He had matriculated at the university and attended one or two courses of lectures. Kuno Fischer was then {{at the height of}} his fame and during the winter had been lecturing brilliantly on Schopenhauer. It was Philip's introduction to philosophy. He had a practical mind and moved uneasily amid the abstract; but he found an unexpected fascination in listening to metaphysical disquisitions; they made him breathless; it was a little like watching a tight-rope dancer doing perilous feats over an abyss; but it was very exciting. The pessimism of the subject attracted his youth; and he believed that the world he was about to enter was a place of pitiless woe and of darkness. That made him none the less eager to enter it; and when, in due course, Mrs. Carey, acting as the correspondent for his guardian's views, suggested that it was time for him to come back to England, he agreed with enthusiasm. He must make up his mind now what he meant to do. If he left Heidelberg at the end of July they could talk things over during August, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to make arrangements.|$|E
