25|$|Some U.S. {{retailers}} offer {{opportunities for}} consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of end-of-life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs {{that use the}} strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry <b>would</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E

500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still <b>would</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{twenty years}} after his last work on Doctor Who, {{he was invited to}} direct four episodes of the 2006 series, {{starring}} David Tennant. Having previously worked with the new series' executive producer Russell T Davies on the programmes On the Waterfront and The House of Windsor, Harper had contacted Davies soon after the announcement of Doctor Whos revival in September 2003, to say that he <b>would</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> to work on it. Scheduling conflicts meant that he was unable to work on the first series of the revival in 2005, but for the second series in 2006 he directed two two-part stories featuring the Cybermen; [...] "Rise of the Cybermen" [...] / [...] "The Age of Steel", and the series finale [...] "Army of Ghosts" [...] / [...] "Doomsday".

50|$|In fact, {{recent studies}} of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold {{minerals}} that point {{to the existence of}} plate tectonics as early as 4 billion years ago.

That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface <b>would</b> be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby eliminating greenhouse effects, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.|$|R

40|$|A {{proposed}} instrumented robotic vehicle {{called an}} "aerover" would fly, roll along the ground, and/or float on bodies of liquid, as needed.

60|$|It was {{two hours}} later when he {{and one of the}} Canarios who had worked on board the coaling company's tug departed, and the rest, {{clustering}} along the Cumbria's rail, watched them wistfully as the little clanking craft slid down the creek. They <b>would</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> have <b>liked</b> to have gone in her, and might have done so had not Jefferson had the forethought to promise them a small share of the profit when the work was done, and fed them well. There are also men who inspire confidence in those they lead, and sailormen capable of carrying out a bargain.

60|$|Frank {{agreed with}} this, {{but he had}} never {{realized}} the truth of it as he did just then. It was clear that the man who made all he wanted must live as the Indians or grosser savages did, and that it was only the division of employments that provided one with the comforts of civilization. Every man, it seemed, lived by the toil of another, for while on the Pacific Slope they turned the forests into dressed lumber and raised fruit and wheat, the clothes they wore, and their saws and plows and axes, came from the East. One could clear a ranch on Puget Sound only because a host of other men puddled liquid iron or pounded white-hot steel in the forges of, for instance, Pennsylvania.

50|$|For {{nearly two}} years after its formation, {{the men of the}} RFA mostly wore {{civilian}} clothing, essentially, whatever they were wearing when enlisted. This caused them great hardship in winter, and Goreham permitted them to wear blankets or rugs in lieu of greatcoats when on sentry at Fort Cumberland. They <b>would</b> have looked <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> their rebel opponents during the siege. Their first uniforms arrived in early 1777, green coats faced white, with white smallclothes, in common with most other Loyalist corps of the American command at that time. Officers wore silver lace. By 1780 the regiment was wearing red coats faced black, probably with white lace for other ranks.|$|R
