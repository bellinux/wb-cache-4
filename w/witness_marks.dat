A geometric geoid model for Singapore was also computed from the geoidal heights derived from the RTK ellipsoidal heights and the adjusted reduced levels of 406 marks which comprise PLBMs, <b>witness</b> <b>marks,</b> offset marks and ISN marks. 43 independent variables dependent on the easting and northing coordinates were initially used to compute the multiple regression surface to best fit 464 benchmarks with geoid separations (GS) which are the dependent variable in the formulation. 58 benchmarks {{were found to have}} outlying GS and subsequently found to have gross errors in their RTK heights.

Stepwise multiple regression using the method of forward selection was used to compute the polynomial equation for the geometric geoid.

The geometric geoid as determined using multiple regression forward stepwise method, RTK heighting and the precise leveling, is able to achieve accuracy to within ± 0. 030 m, ± 0. 040 m and ± 0. 050 m for 82 %, 95 % and 99 %, respectively, of the 464 benchmarks/offset marks/witness marks surveyed...|$|E

Here we report on a new, third type of striation that is visible at higher magnifications on ESEM images. These striations are formed from the imperfections on the cutting teeth of saws and give real possibilities of uniquely identifying whether or not a particular saw was used to cause the mark.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model for slipper-pads which allows lift and tilt behaviour to be predicted, including {{the effects of}} possible contact with the swashplate or slipper retaining plate. This model has been incorporated in the Bathfp simulation package and {{used to examine the}} dynamic stability of slipper-pads over the pumping cycle, and to compare the behaviour over a range of pump speeds. The centripetal tilting moments acting on the slipper-pad increase with speed and as a consequence can lead to contact between the slipper and the swashplate at high speed. This is particularly likely to occur as the piston makes the transition between suction and delivery, where the pressure forces acting on the piston-slipper assembly change abruptly. The predicted nature of the swashplate contacts at high speeds correspond closely with <b>witness</b> <b>marks</b> on a dismantled pump. The model presented may also be used for predicting slipper behaviour in other types of pump, for example wobble-plate type pumps, or in piston motor...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Spatial {{technologies}} such as LiDAR scanning are still in their infancy, yet they are quickly becoming part of our daily lives through their employment as sensory systems in self-driving cars, aerial scans of entire cities and landscapes, or portable terrestrial units. As the increasingly becomes a lens through which we view the physical world, {{there is a greater}} need for designers to explore the opportunities inherent in this technology. The process of scanning produces a highly accurate spatial model of an existing space, providing a simulacrum of the physical world. This 3 -dimensional collage contains not only the banal information of the architectural environment, but includes artifacts of use and inhabitation. This detritus captured in the scans serves as <b>witness</b> <b>marks,</b> or physical manifestations of human intervention whether accidental, incidental or intentional. This project explores the human interaction on the built environment through a forensic study of the present condition of the Metropole Building, a historic site in Seattle’s Pioneer Square. The spatial data of the existing conditions gathered through scanning becomes the foundation for a designed intervention. Antecedents in art and theory are used to provide a framework for the design of a series of architectural interventions into the existing space that form a continual conversation between the building’s history and inherent memory inscribed on the architecture...|$|E

With countless families reliant on remittance inflows as a source of income maintaining their economic livelihood, a reduction would put many at risk of falling below or deeper into poverty. Recognizing the importance of remittance inflows as a lifeline to the poor, policy should aim to (1) reduce the barriers to remit in both sending and receiving nations thus easing the decline in transfers; (2) leverage the development impacts of remittances; and (3) buffer vulnerable groups dependent on remittance transfers as a source of livelihood through sound countercyclical macroeconomic policies.

40|$|Brush seals {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a brush seal occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company seal test program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative brush seal tuft tester that slides a single tuft of brush seal wire against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the brush seal tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale seal tests. Previous {{to the development of the}} brush seal tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale seal tests conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed <b>witness</b> <b>marks.</b> In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded chrome carbide. The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These tests corroborated full-scale seal test results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new brush seal materials combinations must be considered. Future brush seal tuft testing will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings. The ultimate goal of this work is to expand the current data base so that seal designers can tailor brush seal materials to specific applications...|$|E
