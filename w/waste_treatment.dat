At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) incineration is linked intimately {{to the history of}} landfills and other <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technology. The merits of incineration are inevitably judged in relation to the alternatives available. Since the 1970s, recycling and other prevention measures have changed the context for such judgements. Since the 1990s alternative <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technologies have been maturing and becoming viable.|$|E
25|$|The {{methodology}} and other assumptions may also influence the results significantly.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the compostability of food industry process wastes with different bulking agents for disposal and recovery, and to determine the effect of treatment sludge which was used as inoculation agent.

Both the aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment techniques can be used for amine <b>wastes</b> <b>treatment,</b> providing culture adaptation and maintaining suitable operating conditions. Aerobic treatment can, generally, provide higher biodegradation rates while anaerobic processes can be much more energy efficient. A combination of aerobic and anaerobic treatment is promising.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> process removes/prevents the development of floating and bulking sludge by means of ultrasonic emissions in a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> basin. Floating sludge is exposed to an energy intensity of from 0. 1 to 1 kWs/l which drives off gas from the suspension, minimizing formation of sludge. Bulking sludge is exposed to 10 to 80 kWs/l which ruptures chlamydo-bacteria call walls. The energy is introduced to the sludge using 1 kW rod emitters and {{in the presence of}} free phosphor bonds. USE - Process {{to reduce or}} prevent the formation of floating and bulk sludge in a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant.

40|$|Slovenia {{has with}} its {{accession}} to the European Union committed to construct public sewage system and {{wastewater treatment plant}} within deadlines that are written in the Operational programme on discharge and <b>treatment</b> of <b>waste</b> water. Due to scattered settlements in Slovenia the construction of public sewage system and <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plants for each settlement is not economically eligible. Residents of scattered areas which will not be equipped with public sewage systems will have to drain and treat waste water in another way, that is with individual small <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plants or cesspools without outflow. For the inhabitants of these areas the thesis addresses investment costs, operating and maintenance costs of individual <b>treatment</b> of <b>waste</b> water. In the thesis {{it is estimated that}} the costs of providing individual <b>treatment</b> of <b>waste</b> water in a small <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant are ten times lower than the costs of providing individual <b>treatment</b> of <b>waste</b> water in cesspool without outflow, that is why investment in the small <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant for the inhabitants of scattered areas is economically more eligible.
