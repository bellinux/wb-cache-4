5|$|In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 {{adopted by}} the Cortes de Cadiz served {{as the basis for}} {{independence}} in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|Many radical Northerners withdrew {{their support}} for land reform in the years {{following}} the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.|$|E
25|$|This {{transition}} {{left the}} region with some oddities, such as the entire Virginia portion of the Great Dismal Swamp being located entirely within cities (Chesapeake and Suffolk) {{and the rise of}} Virginia Beach to the most populous city in the state (usurping Norfolk), even though it lacks the urban characteristics typically associated with large cities. It was noted by some academicians that the primary motivation for the changes in most, if a not all instances, <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> of annexation, rather than more positive factors.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} to England from India in April 1784, Phillip {{remained}} {{in close contact with}} Townshend, now Lord Sydney, and the Home Office Under Secretary, Evan Nepean. From October 1784 to September 1786 he was employed by Nepean, {{who was in charge of}} the Secret Service relating to the Bourbon Powers, France and Spain, to spy on the French naval arsenals at Toulon and other ports. There <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> that Britain would soon be at war with these powers as a consequence of the Batavian Revolution in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of the early Polish state was Mieszko's military force. The ruler managed to create an army composed of about 3,000 mounted warriors. This increasingly powerful force allowed the Polans to attack weaker neighboring tribes and conquer their lands. A key factor promoting cohesion of the growing state <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> of the invaders impressed by them among local populations. The first Piasts reinforced their rule by burning local strongholds and replacing them with new larger fortresses, located in strategic positions. Archaeological studies show that this practice was abandoned {{only at the end}} of Mieszko's reign, when his position was already well-established.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song lyrics}} {{demonstrates}} a more genuine approach of Fear Factory, {{and according to}} Burton C. Bell, this song illustrates that this present world <b>was</b> shaped by <b>fear</b> and not necessarily concealing it from insanity as seen in science fiction. Bell said {{at the end of}} his quote: [...] "Fear <b>is</b> bondage. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> slavery. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> Hell. <b>Fear</b> <b>is</b> control." [...] Lyrically, this song <b>is</b> about <b>fear</b> of a variety of sufferings, including war, hate, enemy, loss, and failure, plus god and savior. The final line is 'Fear is your god'.|$|R

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> {{later in}} the day that the whale could have perished, as she had not been seen for some time; however, she was spotted by a Port Authority boat at 9:26 am near Albert Bridge. The BDMLR {{decided it was time to}} act. With {{significant}} help from the Port of London Authority and the Metropolitan Police BDMLR medics decided to deliberately beach the whale at low tide on a sandbank, and then move her out of the Thames. At midday they captured the whale, covered her eyes to prevent her from panicking, and made a medical examination.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{proposed}} {{abandoning the}} severely deteriorated line under the failed Program for Action. At the time, only 10,000 passengers used the line per day. It was proposed that bus service along nearby Franklin Avenue could {{substitute for the}} line. During the winter, the line would often be closed because there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> that trains would derail. Stations were in horrible condition; portions of the wooden platforms were sealed off because they had burned or collapsed. In January 1982, the line needed to close for emergency repair work because a retaining wall along the line {{was in danger of}} collapse.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there were many}} {{uncertainties}} about moving to such a place as America. Stories had come back from there about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, {{that there would be}} no source of food or water, that exposure to unknown diseases was possible, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation that was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in what came to be known as the Eighty Years' War, and there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.|$|E

25|$|Fear of {{subversion}} {{was widespread}} throughout the state. In West and Middle Tennessee it <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> of pro-Union activism, which was countered proactively by numerous local Committees of Safety and Vigilance from 1860 to 1862. They emerged {{as early as}} the 1860 Presidential election, and when the war began activists developed an aggressive program to detect and suppress Unionists. The committees set up a spy system, intercepted mail, inspected luggage, forced the enlistment of men into the Confederate Army, confiscated private property, and whenever it seemed necessary lynched enemies of the Confederacy. The committees were disbanded by the Union Army when it took control in 1862.|$|E
25|$|The new Soviet {{government}} {{was anxious to}} establish diplomatic relations with China. It had sent a representative to Beijing; the Chinese government reciprocated with its own to Moscow. Perhaps the principal reason that the Soviets had hesitated to aid the Mongolians too openly <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> of prejudicing those negotiations. But by early 1921 whatever restraints there were upon open Soviet support for Mongolia had ended: China suspended talks with the Soviet government in January 1921; the Chinese government appeared to be incapable of dealing with von Ungern-Sternberg; and in early March it had refused Soviet military assistance against the White Guards. It was then that the Russians became firmly committed to the Mongolian revolution.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the funeral, Union {{headquarters}} ordered no spoken or sung words at the memorial service, and that only Dodd's relatives in Union-held territory (two aunts and their husbands) {{would be allowed to}} attend. The town was tense; a riot was possible and there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> that a Confederate raid would take advantage of the situation. Security around Gen. Steele's headquarters was increased; no one was allowed to see him except on official business. Calm prevailed, and David O. Dodd was buried in plot Elm 355 in the southeast portion of Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, in a grave donated by a Little Rock resident. This cemetery was also the eventual resting place of R.L. Dodge and Gen. Fagan.|$|E

25|$|The churchyard {{contains}} around 2,000 {{graves of}} patients who died at Kirkburton in Storthes Hall psychiatric hospital (1904–1991). Most of these graves are unmarked, in a separate field behind the church which was added by Rev. Arnold Escombe Jerram before he left in 1910. By 1913 there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> in the village that the pauper burials were causing epidemics, because the sexton was saving money by leaving graves open to rain and weather, and not filling them with earth until they each contained their full complement of four coffins. The authorities claimed that Storthes Hall's use of the graveyard benefited Thurstonland by the payment of rates and that only fifty paupers per year, who were unclaimed by relatives, were buried there. Rev. P.S. Brown, at that time vicar of Thurstonland and chaplain to Storthes Hall, claimed that the burials were no danger to health, even though the sexton had to ladle out water from open graves before subsequent funerals.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the Ontario {{government}} {{passed legislation}} requiring Metropolitan Toronto {{to include the}} rest of the Greater Toronto Area into its planning. Despite this however, there <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> different parts of the municipal system were working against one another. Because of this, Bob Rae, then the Premier of Ontario, appointed Anne Golden to head a GTA task force to govern the region's quality of life, competitiveness and governance. During this time, the Metro Toronto government advocated to the task force {{the creation of a new}} GTA authority, which would be made up of 21 of the 30 existing municipalities in the GTA at the time. The proposal from Metro Toronto would have resulted in 15 new municipalities. The City of Mississauga argued consolidation should only take place in such a way the new municipalities would have a population between 400,000 and 800,000. The Town of Markham had similarly advocated municipal consolidation in York Region, although it was opposed to complete consolidation into a single municipality. Municipal consolidation faced stiff opposition however from smaller communities such as Ajax, Milton, and the borough of East York. The task force's recommendation to eliminate the Metro Toronto government, and consolidate its remaining municipalities into an enlarged City of Toronto was completed in 1997, under Mike Harris. However, the task force's recommendation to create a GTA-tier municipality was not taken up by the Harris government, fearing a GTA-wide municipality would recreate the inter-municipal competitiveness that was believed to have impaired the former Metro Toronto government.|$|E

The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power.|$|E

500|$|In 1685, {{one element}} in support for James <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> {{of civil war}} if he were bypassed; anti-Catholic riots in towns {{throughout}} England and Scotland made it appear only his removal could prevent one. The trial of the bishops convinced the Tories to join their Whig opponents in agreeing James had to be deposed. Seven individuals representing elements from the aristocracy, Parliament, the Church, Army and Navy issued an Invitation to William asking him to assume the English throne. On 5th November 1688, William landed in Brixham; as he advanced slowly towards London, James' army deserted him and on 23rd December went into exile in France. In February 1689, the English Parliament declared this amounted to abdication and formally offered the English throne jointly to William and Mary.|$|E

[...] The operative word <b>was</b> <b>fear.</b> Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|His final preparatory {{race for}} the Kentucky Derby was the Wood Memorial, where he {{finished}} a surprising third to Angle Light and Santa Anita Derby winner Sham. Laurin was crushed, {{even though he had}} trained the winner, Angle Light, who set a slow pace and [...] "stole" [...] the race. Secretariat's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit. Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, Pancho Martin, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute centered around the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There <b>was</b> <b>fear</b> that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Lauren to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.|$|E
