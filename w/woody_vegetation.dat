25|$|Stream {{channels}} {{will often}} recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do {{not continue to}} maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation</b> will take hold, stabilizing the banks.

25|$|Extreme flood events often {{result from}} {{coincidence}} such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack, producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like beaver dams. Coincident events may cause extensive flooding {{to be more}} frequent than anticipated from simplistic statistical prediction models considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels. Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation</b> and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and railway equipment. Recent field measurements during the 2010–11 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations.

50|$|Lignin plays a {{significant}} role in the carbon cycle, sequestering atmospheric carbon into the living tissues of <b>woody</b> perennial <b>vegetation.</b> Lignin is one of the most slowly decomposing components of dead vegetation, contributing a major fraction of the material that becomes humus.

30|$|It is {{possible}} to estimate the sedimentation conditions in the original peat bog {{in connection with the}} temperature conditions. The high content of collotelinite (up to 59  vol.%, Table  3) with a discernible cellular structure of plant tissues indicates a humid environment and <b>woody</b> plant <b>vegetation,</b> whereas the higher content of collodetrinite (up to 13  vol.%, Table  3) indicates the subsequent intensive degradation of this <b>woody</b> plant <b>vegetation</b> or the decomposition of a higher amount of herbaceous vegetation. The observed increased liptinite and inertinite contents in durite, trimacerite and carbargilite (see Supplementary material, point 6, Figs VII–X) implies a more intensive decomposition of the organic matter in an arid and oxidizing environment. The ranges of the selected plant species in the Central and Western Bohemian Basins are reported by Pešek (2004) and Opluštil et al. (2016); the plants are described by Kvaček and Straková (1997) and Turek et al. (1998). Intensive degradation of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter under given sedimentation conditions suggests a relatively easy conversion of organic matter to coal, but there is nothing to indicate high temperatures during conversion.|$|R

40|$|Potential of <b>woody</b> species <b>vegetation</b> {{components}} {{is defined}} as the total ability of existing <b>woody</b> species <b>vegetation</b> components (hereinafter referred to as WSVC) of a particular object (or its parts) to ensure the composition stability.

Evaluation is based on mutual confrontation and interpretation of especially these woody species characteristics: taxon, age or development stage and landscaping value. These characteristics are surveyed during the evaluation of woody species as standard in the Czech Republic, or at least at a fairly regular basis. It proceeds from the lowest level (individual) to the highest level (the whole object).

2500|$|Moose lack {{upper front}} teeth, but have eight sharp incisors {{on the lower}} jaw. They also have a tough tongue, lips and gums, which aid in the eating of <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead of those, six pairs of premolars, to grind up their food. A moose's upper lip is very sensitive, to help {{distinguish}} between fresh shoots and harder twigs, and the lip is prehensile, for grasping their food. In the summer, moose may use this prehensile lip for grabbing branches and pulling, stripping the entire branch of leaves in a single mouthful, or for pulling forbs, like dandelions, or aquatic plants up by the base, roots and all. A moose's diet often depends on its location, {{but they seem to}} prefer the new growths from deciduous trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach branches up to [...] or higher above the ground.|$|E
60|$|From Dorjiling the {{appearance}} of parallel ridges {{is found to be}} deceptive, and due to the inosculating spurs of long tortuous ranges that ran north and south throughout the whole length of Sikkim, dividing deep wooded valleys, which form the beds of large rivers. The snowy peaks here look like a long east and west range of mountains, at an average distance of thirty or forty miles. Advancing into the country, this appearance proves equally deceptive, and the snowy range is resolved into isolated peaks, situated on the meridional ridges; their snow-clad spurs, projecting east and west, cross one another, and being uniformly white, appear to connect the peaks into one grand unbroken range. The rivers, instead of having their origin in the snowy mountains, rise far beyond them; many of their sources are upwards of one hundred miles in a straight line from the plains, in a very curious country, loftier by far in mean elevation than the meridional ridges which run south from it, yet comparatively bare of snow. This rearward part of the mountain region is Tibet, where all the Sikkim, Nepal, and Bhotan rivers rise as small streams, increasing in size as they receive the drainage from the snowed parts of the ridges that bound them in their courses. Their banks, between 8000 and 14,000 feet, are generally clothed with rhododendrons, sometimes to the almost total exclusion of other <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation,</b> especially near the snowy mountains--a cool temperature and great humidity being the most favourable conditions for the luxuriant growth of this genus.|$|E

6000|$|Looking to the {{two great}} {{northern}} continents, we see indications of a possible connection between them both in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans; and when we remember that from middle Tertiary times backward--so {{far as we know}} continuously to the earliest Palaeozoic epoch--a temperate and equable climate, with abundant <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation,</b> prevailed up to and within the arctic circle, we see what facilities may have been afforded for migration from one continent to the other, sometimes between America and Europe, sometimes between America and Asia. Admitting these highly probable connections, no bridging of the Atlantic in more southern latitudes (of which there is not a particle of evidence) will have been necessary to account for all the intermigration that has occurred between the two continents. If, on the other hand, we remember how long must have been the route, and how diverse must always have been the conditions between the more northern and the more southern portions of the American and Euro-Asiatic continents, we shall not be surprised that many widespread forms in either continent have not crossed into the other; and that while the skunks (Mephitis), the pouched rats (Saccomyidae), and the turkeys (Meleagris) are confined to America, the pigs and the hedgehogs, the true flycatchers and the pheasants are found only in the Euro-Asiatic continent. But, just as there have been periods which facilitated intermigration between America and the Old World, there have almost certainly been periods, perhaps of long duration even geologically, when these continents have been separated by seas as wide as, or even wider than, those of the present day; and thus may be explained such curious anomalies as the origination of the camel-tribe in America, and its entrance into Asia in comparatively recent Tertiary times, while the introduction of oxen and bears into America from the Euro-Asiatic continent appears to have been equally recent.[168] ...|$|E
60|$|Conclusions {{as to the}} Climates of Tertiary and Secondary Periods.--If now we look at {{the whole}} series of {{geological}} facts as to the animal and vegetable productions of the Arctic regions in past ages, it is certainly difficult to avoid the conclusion that they indicate a climate of a uniformly temperate or warm character. Whether in Miocene, Upper or Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous or Silurian times, and in all the numerous localities extending over more than half the polar regions, we find one uniform climatic aspect in the fossils. This is quite inconsistent with the theory of alternate cold and mild epochs during phases of high excentricity, and persistent cold epochs when the excentricity was as low as it is now or lower, for that would imply that the duration of cold conditions was greater than that of warm. Why then should the fauna and flora of the cold epochs never be {92} preserved? Mollusca and many other forms of life are abundant in the Arctic seas, and there is often a luxuriant dwarf <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation</b> on the land, yet in no one case has a single example of such a fauna or flora been discovered of a date anterior to the last glacial epoch. And this argument is very much strengthened when we remember that an exactly analogous series of facts is found over all the temperate zones. Everywhere we have abundant floras and faunas indicating warmer conditions than such as now prevail, but never in a single instance one which as clearly indicates colder conditions. The fact that drift with Arctic shells was deposited during the last glacial epoch, as well as gravels and crag with the remains of arctic animals and plants, shows us that there is nothing to prevent such deposits being formed in cold as well as in warm periods; and it is quite impossible to believe that in every place and at all epochs all records of the former have been destroyed, while in a considerable number of instances those of the latter have been preserved. When to this uniform testimony of the palæontological evidence we add the equally uniform absence of any indication of those ice-borne rocks, boulders, and drift, which are the constant and necessary accompaniment of every period of glaciation, and which must inevitably pervade all the marine deposits formed over a wide area so long as the state of glaciation continues, we are driven {{to the conclusion that the}} last glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere was exceptional, and was not preceded by numerous similar glacial epochs throughout Tertiary and Secondary time.|$|E
60|$|But besides {{having to}} protect {{themselves}} against competing plants and against destructive animals, there is a yet deadlier enemy in the forces of inorganic nature. Each species can sustain {{a certain amount of}} heat and cold, each requires a certain amount of moisture at the right season, each wants a proper amount of light or of direct sunshine, each needs certain elements in the soil; the failure of a due proportion in these inorganic conditions causes weakness, and thus leads to speedy death. The struggle for existence in plants is, therefore, threefold in character and infinite in complexity, and the result is seen in their curiously irregular distribution over the face of the earth. Not only has each country its distinct plants, but every valley, every hillside, almost every hedgerow, has a different set of plants from its adjacent valley, hillside, or hedgerow--if not always different in the actual species yet very different in comparative abundance, some which are rare in the one being common in the other. Hence it happens that slight changes of conditions often produce great changes in the flora of a country. Thus in 1740 and the two following years the larva of a moth (Phalaena graminis) committed such destruction in many of the meadows of Sweden that the grass was greatly diminished in quantity, and many plants which were before choked by the grass sprang up, and the ground became variegated with a multitude of different species of flowers. The introduction of goats into the island of St. Helena led to the entire destruction of the native forests, consisting of about a hundred distinct species of trees and shrubs, the young plants being devoured by the goats as fast as they grew up. The camel is a still greater enemy to <b>woody</b> <b>vegetation</b> than the goat, and Mr. Marsh believes that forests would soon cover considerable tracts of the Arabian and African deserts if the goat and the camel were removed from them.[6] Even in many parts of our own country the existence of trees is dependent on the absence of cattle. Mr. Darwin observed, on some extensive heaths near Farnham, in Surrey, a few clumps of old Scotch firs, but no young trees over hundreds of acres. Some portions of the heath had, however, been enclosed a few years before, and these enclosures were crowded with young fir-trees growing too close together for all to live; and these were not sown or planted, nothing having been done to the ground beyond enclosing it so as to keep out cattle. On ascertaining this, Mr. Darwin was so much surprised that he searched among the heather in the unenclosed parts, and there he found multitudes of little trees and seedlings which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point about a hundred yards from one of the old clumps of firs, he counted thirty-two little trees, and one of them had twenty-six rings of growth, showing that it had for many years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heather and had failed. Yet this heath was very extensive and very barren, and, as Mr. Darwin remarks, no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and so effectually searched it for food.|$|E
