5|$|Changes in the line-up of the band, due {{not only}} to its musical {{direction}} but also to external events, mark this album as {{a turning point in}} the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Did</b> on Our Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development.|$|E
5|$|Unhalfbricking is {{the third}} album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album {{released}} in 1969. It {{is seen as a}} transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Did</b> on Our Holidays and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E
25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} way we could operate, because we were so small. For us it was not a question of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E

We also looked back at <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that.

25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article aims to vindicate the commonsensical {{view that}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> In {{order to show}} that mental {{properties}} like believing, desiring and intending are causally explanatory, I propose a nonreductive, materialistic account that identifies beliefs and desires by their content, and that shows how differences in the contents of beliefs and desires can make causal differences in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> Key-words: mental causation; causal explanation; intentional properties; supervenience; counterfactuals. It is a truism that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> all suppose that we can change the way that people act by changing their minds. Otherwise, people would not spend {{billions of dollars on}} education, propaganda, advertising, fund-raising drives, political campaigns, or market research. As obvious as this point is, there lurks a philosophical scruple that makes reflective people stand back and wonder how it is possible that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think has any causal bearing on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> The problem is that deep-seated contemporary assumptions about the nature of reality seem to leave no room for our ordinary convictions such as “what <b>we</b> think affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> ” This is th...|$|R
500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> We got {{to the end of the}} second week before we even heard <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things.
