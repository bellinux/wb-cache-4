500|$|During production, Lumet {{felt that}} the {{finished}} film would be [...] "an absolutely unique experience that nobody has ever witnessed before." [...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there {{was nothing to be}} gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even though our concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that we never overlapped in any area." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that it was the}} best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that when it came on the radio, the average person knew {{that it must be}} One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

5000|$|According to Tom Sloper (senior producer) and Marc Metis (product producer) of Activision, [...] "We <b>wanted</b> {{our product}} <b>to</b> be unique. With so many first-person {{shooters}} - so many driving games, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something different {{that made a}} game what it's supposed to be - an original game that draws people in. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a game that's fun with one, two, three or four players." ...|$|R
500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} {{you can actually see}} it come out of his arm. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E

2500|$|No [...] "Crystal" [...] {{variants}} of characters {{have been designed}} for Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, unlike the first game. The Disney Infinity team wanted {{to focus on a}} more diverse array of characters, as said by John Vignocchi [...] "we're not planning on doing the crystal characters again. Our focus this time around – rather than create a whole series of chase characters, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that we had a wider variety of characters," [...] he said. [...] "What we decided to do instead was really put our horsepower into creating different characters as opposed to variants. We think our fans appreciate having a character like Star-Lord or Rocket Raccoon as opposed to another version of Mickey Mouse." [...] The game has been designed to be less violent, in order to appeal to a wider audience. Despite this, a Crystal variation of Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey Mouse will be released.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 2002, Sierra {{announced}} {{the game was}} also being released for Game Boy Advance, developed by Saffire Corporation. Sierra also revealed the GBA version would feature more stealth and less combat than the GameCube version, and would follow {{the plot of the}} novel a little more closely. On February 24, 2003, they {{announced the}} game would also be released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows, with Inevitable Entertainment handling the PlayStation and Xbox versions, and The Fizz Factor developing the Windows version. Ken Embery, Sierra's executive producer on the game, stated [...] "the plan all along was to be multiplatform. But we were starting out with GameCube as the lead and were just holding our cards close to our chest before announcing all of our other titles. The PS2 is, of course, the most problematic of all the platforms for developers to deal with and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that we had solid prototypes and running proof of concept versions before we made it public. Embery explained the art style of the game was influenced by the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, and in that sense, was aimed at a slightly younger audience than the Lord of the Rings films. Tory Skinner, of Vivendi Universal Games, further stated [...] "The Hobbit was written for a younger audience, so it made sense to create a game that would be enjoyable for younger kids, as well as adults. We looked at the different types of game we could do, and an action-adventure game with a heavy emphasis on the action seemed like the best way to go. We didn't want to make the game inaccessible by loading down gamers with hard-core RPG gameplay." ...|$|E

We weren't happy with Interscope at all. So we sat down and told them <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> both All and Descendents records {{whenever}} <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> at our choosing.

Nobody was going to tell us we had to put one out right now and then we’d rush through a bunch of songs to put out. <b>We</b> didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the album <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ...
