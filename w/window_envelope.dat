50|$|John Dickinson {{patented}} {{a method}} of paper-making in June 1807, that rendered his rivals' techniques (principally the Fourdrinier machine) obsolete. In 1850, the company started mechanical envelope manufacturing, with gummed envelopes for the first time.

5000|$|<b>Window</b> <b>envelopes</b> have a hole cut in {{the front}} side that allows the paper within to be seen. They are {{generally}} arranged so that the receiving address printed on the letter is visible, saving the sender from having to duplicate the address on the <b>envelope</b> itself. The <b>window</b> is normally covered with a transparent or translucent film to protect the letter inside, as was first designed by Americus F. Callahan in 1901 and patented the following year. In some cases, shortages of materials or the need to economize resulted in envelopes that had no film covering the window. One innovative process, invented in Europe about 1905, involved using hot oil to saturate {{the area of the}} envelope where the address would appear. The treated area became sufficiently translucent for the address to be readable. [...] there is no international standard for <b>window</b> <b>envelopes,</b> but some countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have national standards.|$|R

50|$|<b>Windowed</b> <b>envelopes</b> often create {{problems}} in recycling. Due {{to the fact}} that the window may be made of plastic while the letter itself is made of paper, simply putting one in a box intended for paper recycling may prevent the entire envelope or the entire box from being mechanically recycled, though some post-consumer paper mills may tolerate or remove the contaminants. Due to the potential problems, consumers are advised to rip out the plastic window before putting such an envelope in a box intended for paper recycling.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally Envelope Detection (ED) is {{implemented}} for detection of {{rolling element bearing}} faults by extracting the envelope of band-passed vibration signal and thereafter taking its Fourier transform. The performance of ED is highly sensitive to the <b>envelope</b> <b>window</b> (i. e. central frequency and bandwidth of the passband). This paper employs Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to select the most optimum <b>envelope</b> <b>window</b> to band pass the vibration signals emanating from rotating driveline that was run in normal and with faults induced rolling element bearings. The envelopes of band-passed signals were extracted {{with the help of}} Hilbert Transform. The performance of ED whose <b>envelope</b> <b>window</b> was optimised by PSO to identify various commonly occurring bearing faults such as bearing with Outer Race Fault (ORF), Inner Race Fault (IRF) and Rolling Element Fault (REF) were checked under varying load conditions. The performance of ‘ED enhanced by PSO’ was also checked with increase in the severity of defect. It was shown that the improved ED method is successfully able to identify all types of bearing faults under different load conditions. It was shown that the by selecting <b>envelope</b> <b>window</b> by PSO makes ED especially useful to identify bearing faults at the incipient stage of defect. It was also shown by presenting comparative performance that by optimising the <b>envelope</b> <b>window</b> by PSO the performance of ED gets significantly enhanced in comparison to the traditional ED method for bearing fault diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to predict the {{trajectory}} of an envelope when conveyed between two flat belts in a mail sorting machine, as it is often the case in postal centers. Each of the two sides of the envelope is in contact with one belt. The friction coefficient can vary between the two sides, e. g. for the cases of a postcard or a plastic <b>windowed</b> <b>envelope.</b> The two belts are assumed to travel horizontally with the same velocities, but in real world small velocity differ-ences can occur. Also, some deviation from the horizontality of the belts can be observed. These phenomena can lead to unexpected situations where the relative position of the envelope to the belt changes during transportation. The work focuses on the belt-envelope mechanical interac-tions in order to predict the envelope position during its conveying. A 2 D model is developed which considers the dynamic equilibrium of the envelope and simulates the transient behavior at different locations in the sorting machine. In the dynamic friction model, the contact surfaces between the envelope sides and the belts have to be determined at each time step. The belt/envelope friction forces are applied at the centers of these contact surfaces One side of the envelope is considered stuck (in adhesion) to the belt while the other is considered slipping. The position of the envelope center of gravity and the angle with the horizontal axis are calculated. For evaluation of the proposed dynamic model, several cases of operation are simulated. The results obtained are consistent with observations made on a real sorting machine. The influence of multiple driving parameters are highlighted: the plastic window location on the envelope, the friction coefficient and the speed difference between belts...|$|R
