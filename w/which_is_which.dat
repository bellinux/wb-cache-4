5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
2500|$|The term RAST {{became a}} {{colloquialism}} for all varieties of (in vitro allergy) tests. [...] This is unfortunate {{because it is}} well recognized that there are well-performing tests and some that do not perform so well, yet they are all called RASTs, {{making it difficult to}} distinguish <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> For these reasons, it is now recommended that use of RAST as a generic descriptor of these tests be abandoned.|$|E

For enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFET symbols (in columns two and five), the source terminal is the one connected to the triangle. Additionally, in this diagram, the gate is shown as an [...] "L" [...] shape, whose input leg is closer to S than D, also indicating <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> However, these symbols are often drawn with a [...] "T" [...] shaped gate (as elsewhere on this page), so it is the triangle which must be relied upon to indicate the source terminal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series has}} been {{described}} as the 21st century's answer to Yes Minister, highlighting the struggles and conflicts between politicians, party spin doctors, advisers, civil servants and the media. As with Yes Minister, the political parties involved are never mentioned by name, although the context makes clear <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> Iannucci describes it as [...] "Yes Minister meets Larry Sanders". The journalist and former civil servant Martin Sixsmith is an adviser to the writing team, adding to the realism of some scenes. The series became well known for its profanity and for featuring storylines which have mirrored, or in some cases predicted real-life policies, events or scandals.|$|E
2500|$|ESS-1 sonar and ESS-2 sonar are Chinese VDS and hull mounted sonars (HMS) {{developed}} from similar western counterparts. [...] The origin of ESS-1 VDS and ESS-2 hull mounted sonar {{are subject to}} debate {{due to lack of}} official information, with some sources claim that ESS-2/1 are the Chinese version of DE-1160/1162 HMS/VDS, while others claim that it is the Chinese version of DUBV-23/43 HMS/VDS. [...] Since the Italian and French sonars have similar performance (20 km for HMS, and 50 km for VDS), {{it is difficult to determine}} <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which,</b> since official Chinese governmental sources only confirms the 20/50 km ranges for HMS/VDS. ESS-2 sonar has bearing accuracy of 1 degree and like its predecessors SJD-1/2, it has a cylindrical transducer.|$|E
2500|$|Kenneth Lanning, an FBI {{expert in}} the {{investigation}} of child sexual abuse, has stated that pseudo-satanism may exist but there is [...] "little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies". There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true....I {{believe that there is a}} middle ground—a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be [...] "contaminated" [...] or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging [...] "ritual" [...] abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.|$|E

5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> coelurosaurs, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> theropods, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> saurischians, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> dinosaurs.|$|R
2500|$|Other episodes such as [...] "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", set in 1913, {{depict the}} racism {{of an earlier}} era (Edwardian era). For Orthia, the few Doctor Who serials that {{explicitly}} depict racism [...] "are remarkable by their presence: they carry rhetorical power {{because they are so}} rare in Doctor Who." [...] In [...] "Human Nature", in addition to the racist jibes of private school boys, [...] "we bear witness to how things have changed, when a white nurse refuses to believe that Martha is a medical student in the future, saying, [...] "Women might train to be doctors, but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour."" [...] When the TARDIS crew are nationally branded as terrorists in [...] "The Sound of Drums", the Master (Simm) says that the Doctor's current companions [...] "tick every demographic box"– referring to Martha's gender and ethnicity and Jack's sexual orientation. He later refers to Jack (Barrowman) and Martha as [...] "the girlie and the freak", adding to the insult by claiming he is not sure <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> Episodes set in the future, Orthia notes, are more often than not inclusive and [...] "cosmopolitan" [...] projections of societies which are as multi-racial (though not multi-ethnic) and sexually liberal as the present, if not more so. In 2009, Martha was listed among the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons by Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
2500|$|Some [...] "hospital services" [...] {{can be done}} as {{inpatient}} services, {{which would}} be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The [...] "Two-Midnight Rule" [...] decides <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>which.</b> In August 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a final rule concerning eligibility for hospital inpatient services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that “crosses two midnights,” Medicare Part A payment is “generally appropriate.” However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B. The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can {{take into consideration the}} pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient’s care will reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A. In addition to deciding which trust fund is used to pay for these various outpatient vs. inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.|$|E
