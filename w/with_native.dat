Using data from the Survey Integration Minorities (SIM, 2006), we aim to explain the influence of social interaction <b>with</b> <b>natives</b> on the identification of minority groups with the Netherlands by taking into account the mechanisms of cultural and economic integration. The results show that social interaction <b>with</b> <b>natives</b> is positively related to identification with the Netherlands. Both cultural and economic integration explained a significant part of this relation. In almost all models the positive effects were lowest for the Turkish group and highest for the Surinamese group...|$|R

5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America.

5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo along <b>with</b> <b>native</b> Indian birds. It {{depicts a}} slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A.

It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen dodos. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E

On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast.

Though park preservation efforts can conflict <b>with</b> <b>native</b> religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean <b>with</b> <b>native</b> starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} veiling as Muslim {{religious practice}} among {{first and second}} generation Turkish and Moroccan immigrant women in the Netherlands. Building on theoretical perspectives within the sociology of religion, it investigates whether strength of religiosity, education, contact <b>with</b> <b>natives,</b> gender role attitudes, unemployment and discrimination can explain who veils and why. The results support the scientific worldview and the social integration theory. Women who are more religious and endorse more traditional gender role attitudes {{are more likely to}} veil whereas higher educated and those with more contact <b>with</b> <b>natives</b> are less likely to wear a headscarf. When assessing whether the same predictors can explain who holds which motive for (not) veiling, our findings suggest that only contact <b>with</b> <b>natives</b> is related to motives for not veiling. Therefore, it is concluded that the framework of secularisation theory relates to whether one veils, but is less suitable to explain why...|$|R

5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met <b>with</b> <b>Native</b> Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E

Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E

By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
