5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E
500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for {{just a little bit of}} time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> a little bit when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew who we were, to the complete opposite".|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck, of the Hollywood Reporter, {{believed}} {{that even though}} Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so [...] "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guide's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a [...] "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more {{in the footsteps of}} Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's [...] "savage, greasy-haired '70s" [...] films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent [...] "torture porn" [...] horror films. Bill Gibron, of PopMatters, believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true [...] "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> would result in his [...] "desire for death".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He criticized {{the characterization of}} Andy {{and said that the}} character had [...] "hit a plateau when his fist <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> wall in season three" [...] and represented [...] "a grinning puppet who can be imbued with some of Michael Scott's leftover tics and remind people he went to Cornell". However, Adams enjoyed the episode's subplots and wrote that the episode really [...] "gave me a better picture of what makes Andy's girlfriend tick." [...] Furthermore, he praised many of her lines and her acting ability. Damon Houx of ScreenCrush said that the episode was a [...] "surprisingly strong Erin episode" [...] and that [...] "Dwight acting crazy was also well used". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a nice enough holiday episode". He was critical of the episode's Jim and Pam subplot, saying that it could have [...] "been left on the cutting room floor." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White awarded the episode a 7.9 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. She wrote that while the story had its limitations, [...] "Little lines and bits ... helped elevate 'Here Comes Treble.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> door.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{producers}} and songwriters {{who did not}} contribute to Metamorphosis worked on the album, including Andreas Carlsson and Desmond Child ("Who's That Girl?"), British songwriter Guy Chambers ("Shine"), Julian Bunetta and James Michael ("The Getaway") and Ty Stevens ("Rock This World"). Ron Entwistle is co-writer and co-producer of [...] "Weird", which Duff said is [...] "about someone that she's still obsessed with. And everything he does is like he says this, but he does this ... She's not really sure who he is or what he does, but she likes it." [...] Kevin De Clue contributed to [...] "The Last Song" [...] and [...] "Mr. James Dean" [...] (both co-produced by Haylie), which Duff has named her favorite track on the album and described as [...] "very funny"; in the song, she tells an ex-boyfriend that he'll [...] "never be James Dean". Duff neither confirmed nor denied whether the song was about fellow singer Aaron Carter, and she said [...] "it was definitely an experience that I <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> was interesting and I {{learned a lot from}} that time in my life." [...] In [...] "Hide Away", co-produced and co-written by Shaun Shankel, Duff discusses a relationship that isn't working because she is in a position where her life is [...] "figuratively under the microscope". Diane Warren wrote [...] "I Am", an empowerment song in which Duff lists positive and negative aspects about herself; she has said it is about being comfortable [...] "with all those feelings ... being who you are". David Campbell arranged and conducted strings for the tracks [...] "Someone's Watching Over Me" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl?".|$|E

6000|$|At last, {{the hands}} of the clock reached the hour, the hour that was wont to evoke Ned's last sigh and set him free; but it was an {{aggravating}} clock. Nothing would persuade it to hurry.

On the contrary, it <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> second quite as slowly as all the others. Ned fancied it went much slower at that one on purpose; and then, with a sneaking parade of its intention to begin to strike, it gave a prolonged hiss, and did its duty, and nothing but its duty; by striking the hour at a pace so slow, that it recalled forcibly to Ned Hooper's imaginative mind, [...] "the minute-gun at sea." ...|$|E

Then I entered into the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost half the way through it.[119] I thought I should have been killed there, over and over; but at last day broke, and the sun rose, and I <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> which was behind with far more ease and quiet.|$|E
