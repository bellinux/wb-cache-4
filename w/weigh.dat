5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through <b>weigh</b> stations at the borders of most states and some large cities. These <b>weigh</b> stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. <b>Weigh</b> stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|Dating {{the monuments}} remains {{difficult}} because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation. Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period (1500–1000BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC) period. The smallest <b>weigh</b> 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to <b>weigh</b> 40 to 50 tons, although it was abandoned and left uncompleted close {{to the source of}} its stone.|$|E
5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a <b>weigh</b> station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to <b>weigh</b> the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Automatic <b>weighing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk <b>weighing,</b> smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and <b>weighed</b> by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often <b>weighed</b> automatically by in-motion road vehicle <b>weighing</b> instruments or automatic rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, <b>weighing</b> of container wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for <b>weighing</b> building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry.

5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through <b>weigh</b> stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E
