5|$|Following Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about {{possible}} 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, {{director of the}} Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> for Gillibrand to hold in 2008, noting Republicans substantially outnumbered Democrats in the district.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, NHL Players' Association {{director}} Paul Kelly {{suggested that}} the World Championships be held every other year and that the NHL go on break to allow full player participation. IIHF president René Fasel responded that the tournament has television contracts and hosting commitments and that a large change <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to put in place.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained {{a position as}} a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, {{making it impossible for}} him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E

5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult,</b> but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult,</b> but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had {{the best chance to}} overcome the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> for them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|On {{the season}} {{having a big}} {{crossover}} in early 2017 like previous seasons, Bell said that any crossover {{will not be as}} large scale as the first season crossover with , which changed the premise of the series, and noted that the MCU film being released at that time is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to tie-in with as it is not set on Earth, and takes place earlier in the MCU continuity than the season is set.|$|E

5|$|Squall was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modelled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made so that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance {{was in the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify, since {{it would not be}} singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E

5|$|Two {{proposed}} {{forms for}} dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar {{fields such as}} quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his {{dissatisfaction with the}} position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect {{due to the}} strong glare of the nearby Sun, and {{ground-based}} searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E

Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E
