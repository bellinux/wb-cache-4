5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also {{thought it would be}} easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E

5|$|The Briscoe Brothers {{returned}} to ROH at the Fourth Anniversary Show in 2006, forcibly including {{themselves in a}} match that was at first between the teams of Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro and Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze. They won in their re-debut. They then feuded for the tag team championship again, but much as they had against Styles and Red three years earlier, they lost in three shots against the champions at the time, Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, at Ring of Homicide, Destiny, and Unified. As before, the storyline <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> cost them any chance at the belts {{for as long as}} those champs held them. It was around this time that the Brothers became enforcers for Jim Cornette's heel character as ROH Commissioner, fighting battles against his enemies, most notably Homicide and his partner Samoa Joe at Glory By Honor V: Night Two and in anything goes, falls count anywhere, elimination match at Dethroned. During this time, they also feuded with Kenta and his partners Davey Richards and Naomichi Marufuji, facing Kenta and Richards at Time to Man Up and Kenta and Marufuji at Glory By Honor V: Night One.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E
5|$|The problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> archiepiscopal status had {{not been}} cleared with the papacy, opening the way for English archbishops to claim overlordship of the whole Scottish church. The man {{responsible}} was the new aggressively assertive Archbishop of York, Thurstan. His easiest target was the bishopric of Glasgow, which being south of the river Forth was not regarded as part of Scotland nor the jurisdiction of St Andrews. In 1125, Pope Honorius II wrote to John, Bishop of Glasgow ordering him {{to submit to the}} archbishopric of York. David ordered Bishop John of Glasgow to travel to the Apostolic See in order to secure a pallium which would elevate the bishopric of St Andrews to an archbishopric with jurisdiction over Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Those ransomed were valued on {{a sliding}} scale, ranging from around 1,875DM for a manual worker to around 11,250DM for a doctor. The justification, {{according}} to East Germany, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was {{compensation for the}} money invested by {{the state in the}} prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E
25|$|During the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongol {{emperors}} made Esoteric Buddhism {{an official}} religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court. A common perception <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> patronage of lamas caused corrupt forms of tantra to become widespread. When the Mongol Yuan Dynasty was overthrown and the Ming Dynasty was established, the Tibetan lamas were {{expelled from the}} court, and this form of Buddhism was denounced as not being an orthodox path.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{following}} the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's Ages in Chaos series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised {{a conference in}} Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> particular revision of chronology was untenable, although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.|$|E

25|$|Line 1 {{opened with}} 20 cars of type TFS-1, {{this being the}} {{original}} variant of the Alstom TFS design. TFS stands for Tramway Français Standard, and the intention <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> design would become the standard for subsequent French tramway systems. However, {{in the end the}} design was significantly revised for the Grenoble tram system, the second system to open, introducing the low-floor TFS-2 variant. Consequently, only Nantes has ever operated the TFS-1 variant.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} {{there had been}} a spate of {{criticism}} of the South African Judiciary by Zuma supporters, amongst whom were some prominent legal minds, such as Paul Ngobeni. In that context, the irony <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the third time the South African Judiciary had found in his favour, including Zuma's acquittal of the rape charge brought against him. The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal the decision.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Khamenei {{requested}} that government officials speed up Iran's move towards economic privatization. Its last move towards such a goal was in 2004, when Article 44 {{of the constitution}} was overturned. Article 44 had decreed that Iran's core infrastructure should remain state-run. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights should be protected in courts {{set up by the}} Justice Ministry; the hope <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> new protection would give a measure of security to and encourage private investment.|$|E

25|$|After the lying-in-state and {{funeral of}} the popular but {{controversial}} Pope Pius X, cardinals assembled for the conclave {{at the end of}} August 1914. One major difference with earlier conclaves <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> time no secular monarch claimed a veto over whomever the cardinals could select as pope, as a result of legislation promulgated by Pius X, that established that whosoever attempted to introduce a veto in the conclave would incur automatic excommunication. For the first time in centuries the cardinals alone would make the choice.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer praises Kant for his {{distinction}} between appearance and the things-in-themselves that appear, whereas {{the general consensus}} in German Idealism <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the weakest spot of Kant’s theory, since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot {{be the cause of}} appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.|$|E
25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

25|$|An early {{problem for}} the escapees was that most were unable to find {{the way into the}} railway station, until {{daylight}} revealed it was in a recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either to walk across country or wait on the platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E
25|$|However, {{estimates}} of the Phalange's membership by Yezid Sayigh and other academic sources put them at a few thousand. Non-academic sources tend to inflate the Phalanges membership. What {{should be kept in}} mind <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> insurrection was met with widespread disapproval by many Lebanese who wanted no part in the regional politics and many young men aided the Phalange in their suppression of the insurrection, especially as many of the demonstrators were little more than proxy forces hired by groups such as the ANM and Fatah founders as well as being hired by the defeated parliamentary bosses.|$|E
25|$|It was {{determined}} the original site offered the best {{location in the}} town for a replacement town hall.

There were 86 entries to the competition, with the £500 top prize going to Bradshaw Gass & Hope from Bolton. Building work started in May 1935 and was completed the following year. One key design feature <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> time the building was to be constructed from fireproof materials.|$|E
