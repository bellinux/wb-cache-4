5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James {{wrote a letter to the}} Kansas City Times, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies. [...] "But I don't care what the degraded Radical party thinks about me," [...] he wrote, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> soon they would think I was a robber as not." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} written that male guardians such as fathers and husbands did not consent to their wives or daughters being {{examined}} by male practitioners unless absolutely necessary in life or death circumstances. The male guardians <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> soon treat their women themselves or have them be seen by female practitioners {{for the sake of}} privacy. The women similarly felt the same way; such is the case with pregnancy and the accompanying processes such as child birth and breastfeeding, which were solely reliant upon advice given by other women. The role of women as practitioners appears in a number of works despite the male dominance within the medical field. Two female physicians from Ibn Zuhr's family served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century, female surgeons were illustrated {{for the first time in}} Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu's Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye (Imperial Surgery). Treatment provided to women by men was justified to some by prophetic medicine (al-tibba alnabawi), otherwise known as [...] "medicine of the prophet" [...] (tibb al-nabi), which provided the argument that men can treat women, and women men, even if this means they must expose the patient's genitals in necessary circumstances.|$|E

2500|$|Falwell {{condemned}} homosexuality as {{forbidden by}} the Bible. Gay rights groups called Falwell an [...] "agent of intolerance" [...] and [...] "the {{founder of the}} anti-gay industry" [...] for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant's 1977 [...] "Save Our Children" [...] campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the repeal of the ordinance, Falwell told one crowd, [...] "Gay folks <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> soon kill you as look at you." [...] When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them [...] "brute beasts" [...] and stated, [...] "this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there'll be a celebration in heaven." [...] He later denied this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, [...] "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals." [...] Amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a Teletubby being a homosexual role model for homosexual recruitment and stating that LGBT organizations angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the September 11 attacks happen.|$|E
2500|$|As the franc was devalued by 20% to the Reichmark, which {{together}} with German policies of food requisition both {{to support their}} own army and the German home front, leading Ousby to write [...] "France was slowly being bled dry by the outflow not just of meat and drink, fuel and leather, but of wax, frying pans, playing cards, axe handles, perfume {{and a host of}} other goods as well. Parisians, at least, had got the point as early as December 1940. When Hitler shipped back the Duc de Reichstadt's remains for a solemn burial in Les Invalides, people said they would have preferred coal rather than ashes." [...] People could not legally buy items without a ration book with the population being divided into categories A, B, C, E, J, T and V; among the products rationed included meat, milk, butter, cheese, bread, sugar, eggs, oil, coffee, fish, wine, soap, tobacco, salt, potatoes and clothing. The black market flourished in occupied France with the gangsters from the milieu (underworld) of Paris and Marseilles soon becoming very rich by supplying rationed goods. The milieu established struggling networks bringing in rationed goods over the Pyrenees from Spain, and it was soon learned that for the right price, they were also willing to smuggle people out of France like Allied airmen, refugees, Jews, résistants and later on in the war, would smuggle in agents from the SOE. However, the milieu were only interested in making money, and <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> easily betray those who wanted to be smuggled in or out of France if the Germans or Vichy were willing to make a better offer.|$|E
