The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J.

It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2017, Dylan {{released}} his triple album, Triplicate, comprising 30 new recordings of classic American songs, including [...] "As Time Goes By" [...] by Herman Hupfeld and [...] "Stormy Weather" [...] by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. Dylan's 38th studio album {{was recorded in}} Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. [...] "Nostalgic? No I wouldn’t say that. It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for {{the good old days}} or fond memories of what’s no more. A song like [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] is not a <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> song, it doesn’t emulate the past, it’s attainable and down to earth, it’s in the here and now." [...] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: [...] "For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good old days of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just like you did <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party. [...] have the option to interject some special comment into a conversation that might open up otherwise unavailable avenues". [...] Reviewers were grateful that the time-based, [...] "spirit-eating" [...] gameplay mechanic of Mask of the Betrayer was not included.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rodríguez, {{the origins}} of the film go back to Desperado. He says, [...] "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>when,</b> never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature." [...] In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in Desperado. [...] "So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000.

2500|$|Later in October, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Richard {{is one of the most}} exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands." [...] McTavish was quoted on his casting, [...] "I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable." [...] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on , resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, [...] "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli." [...] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, [...] "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [...] on these movies." [...] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, [...] "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. [...] Given that Óin is almost 200years old I can presume only that it was the age." [...] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, [...] "Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'" ...|$|E
