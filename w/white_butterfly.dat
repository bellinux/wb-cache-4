5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large <b>white</b> <b>butterfly.</b> When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E

5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
25|$|Most {{butterflies}} have bright colours {{on their}} wings. Nocturnal moths {{on the other}} hand are usually plain brown, grey, white or black and often with obscuring patterns of zigzags or swirls which help camouflage them from predators as they rest during the day. However, many day-flying moths are brightly coloured, particularly if they are toxic. These diurnal species evolved to locate their mates visually and not primarily by pheromone as their drab nocturnal cousins. A few butterflies are also plain-coloured, like the cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> or the baron butterfly.|$|E
500|$|Jacqueline Banerjee {{views the}} tale {{as a failure}} story. “Not surprisingly,“ she writes, “”Thumbelina“ is now often read as a story of {{specifically}} female empowerment.“ Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque, and observes that “the grotesque in children’s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader“. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests. Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay [...] "Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality" [...] believes the tale may be analyzed, {{from the perspective of}} Freudian psychoanalysis, as the story of female masturbation.

The caterpillar stage of the [...] "small cabbage white butterfly" [...] (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the [...] "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.|$|E
