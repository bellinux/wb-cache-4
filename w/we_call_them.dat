500|$|Stoddart {{graduated}} in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, first class, {{though he was}} demoralised by his peers' ignorance of art history: [...] "the name Raphael meant nothing to them". He went on to read History of Art at the University of Glasgow. Afterwards, he worked for six [...] "difficult" [...] years in the studio of Ian Hamilton Finlay. Although Hamilton Finlay {{is considered one of}} the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: [...] "Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called the people who made his work 'collaborators'. What <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're talented people who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>them.</b> I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo {{expressed}} the opinion that cultigens (as <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> now) were produced from wild plants {{as the result of}} the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods. In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided. This has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification. All biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups, known as a nested hierarchy, but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution. [...] The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371–286 BCE), known as the [...] "father of botany". In his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the plant kingdom into trees, shrubs, undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated, flowering and non-flowering, deciduous or evergreen.|$|E
500|$|The set {{containing}} Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans {{fitted with}} 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8inches apart. Ambrose {{collaborated with the}} production team to institute twenty-five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I-beams. Ambrose proclaimed that {{the flexibility of the}} trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added: [...] "We also had four 20Ks and a few more T-12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close-ups, we often used Barger-Baglite six- and three-light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60- and 90-degree honeycomb grids for control." [...] In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the color spectrum of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. [...] "We used a lot of batten strips with 100-watt household bulbs," [...] noted Ambrose. [...] "The bulbs are so close they're almost touching, so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates. <b>We</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well." ...|$|E
