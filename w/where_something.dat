5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment <b>where</b> <b>something</b> that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

25|$|System {{analysis}} {{is used in}} every field <b>where</b> <b>something</b> is developed. Analysis {{can also be a}} series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. System engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.|$|E
25|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that hard {{determinism}} need not maintain strict determinism, <b>where</b> <b>something</b> near to, like that informally known as adequate determinism, is perhaps more relevant. Despite this, hard determinism has grown less popular in present times, given scientific suggestions that determinism is false – yet the intention of their position is sustained by hard incompatibilism.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Bate Tichenor's house at Contembo Ranch in Michoacán {{was a simple}} Tuscan-style country villa cross-shaped designed brick and adobe two-story structure that she built with her Purépechan lover Roberto in 1958. Ario de Rosales was named “place <b>where</b> <b>something</b> was sent to be said” in the Purépecha language. Bate Tichenor became an artistic channel for the place that she chose to call her home.|$|E

25|$|Traumatic {{events are}} more subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event <b>where</b> <b>something</b> so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E
500|$|Following the cancellation, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox {{used the}} Nimrod MRA4 {{procurement}} {{as an example}} of the worst of MOD procurement performance: [...] "The idea that we ever allow ourselves into a position <b>where</b> <b>something</b> that was originally Nimrod 2000 – where we ordered [...] was reduced to nine, spent £3.8bn and we still weren't close to getting the capability – is not to happen again." [...] Nevertheless, six ex-defence chiefs publicly criticised the decision to scrap the Nimrods in January 2011 and the Public Accounts Committee concluded in February 2012 [...] that the decision had been made without a proper understanding of the cost implications and had wasted £3.4bn.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} {{brought before the}} Home Circuit Court on April 24, 2014, however it could not proceed because {{important}} documents had not been served on the defence. The witnesses for the case, who included ten police officers and two civilians, were bound over. Senior Puisne Judge Gloria Smith stated that no further adjournments of the case would be permitted, ordering the Director of Public Prosecutions to make full disclosure to the defence, and insisting that the trial must start on May 19. In her words, [...] "This case {{has been going on}} for far too long and has reached the point <b>where</b> <b>something</b> must happen." [...] However, on that date the trial was postponed again due to the unavailability of a courtroom, being rescheduled for June 1. At that date it was again postponed, this time due to a shortage of available jurors, with the new date being set for July 7.|$|E

500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece <b>where</b> <b>something</b> [...] "doesn't have to happen... every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were {{inspired}} by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E
500|$|While Amelia {{waits for}} the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house <b>where</b> <b>something,</b> presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is {{actually}} Smith in footage intended for the finale, [...] "The Big Bang", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms {{that he is the}} man she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based the style of the confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an electrical wire that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The [...] "fish fingers and custard" [...] scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were actually a breaded coconut-flavored food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them.|$|E

2500|$|Eric Luce of Ex {{criticized the}} second manga for its {{characters}} and pacing stating: [...] "This manga moves so slowly, one is tempted just to skip pages {{at a time}} to find a scene <b>where</b> <b>something</b> is happening.

2500|$|A common {{euphemism}} is [...] [...] This {{is similar}} to the usage in American English of [...] "washroom", which literally means a room <b>where</b> <b>something</b> is washed, and [...] "toilet", which literally refers to the act of self-cleaning. It is also common to see another loan translation, , on signs in department stores and supermarkets, as well as accompanying the public toilet pictogram.|$|E

2500|$|LQG never {{introduces}} a background and excitations living on this background, so LQG {{does not use}} gravitons as building blocks. Instead one expects that one may recover a kind of semiclassical limit or weak field limit <b>where</b> <b>something</b> like [...] "gravitons" [...] will show up again. In contrast, gravitons {{play a key role}} in string theory where they are among the first (massless) level of excitations of a superstring.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the word}} faie was added the suffix -erie (Modern English -(e)ry), {{used to express}} either a place <b>where</b> <b>something</b> is found (fishery, nunnery) or a trade or typical {{activity}} engaged in (cookery, thievery). In later usage it generally applied {{to any kind of}} quality or activity associated with a particular type of person, as in English knavery, roguery, wizardry. In the sense [...] "land where fairies dwell", the distinctive and archaic spellings Faery and Faerie are often used.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{interviewees}} also expressed {{a level of}} disillusionment with Japanese society and its emphasis on the material, often {{at the expense of}} the spiritual or moral side of the society. One interviewee assessed the situation, saying, [...] "we've lost any sense of crisis and material things are all that matters. The idea that it's wrong to harm other has gradually disappeared." [...] Another interviewee, a subway worker, said, [...] "I already knew society had gotten to the point <b>where</b> <b>something</b> like Aum had to happen... It's a question of morals." [...] Several interviewees also voiced criticism of the media, namely due to the way it misrepresented and sensationalized the sarin attacks. Murakami himself expressed similar sentiments in the book's preface.|$|E
