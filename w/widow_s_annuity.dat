Although euphausiids were the most common major prey of all three predators, gelatinous zooplankton and fishes were the most commonly consumed prey items during some seasonal quarters. The influence of the El Niño event was evident in the diets. Anomalous prey items, including the southern euphausiid species Nyctiphanes simplex and juveniles of Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) frequently appeared in the diets {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. The results of stomach contents analyses, based on 905 stomach samples from 49 trawl hauls during seven commercial fishing trips and from 56 stations during research surveys, were consistent with the timing of occurrence and the magnitude of change in biomass of some zooplankton species reported from zooplankton studies in the northern California Current during the 1997 – 98 El Niño. Our findings indicate that the observed variations of prey groups in some rockfish diets may be a function of prey variability related to climate and environment changes...|$|R

40|$|As {{growing numbers}} of retirees reach {{retirement}} age with substantial balances in self-directed retirement plans, annuities {{are likely to become}} increasingly important instruments for drawing down retirement savings. This study explores recent trends in the pricing of single-premium annuity products in the United States. Virtually all of the annuity products currently available in the United States offer fixed nominal payouts, rather than an inflation-linked payout stream. After describing the money's worth' of the various types of nominal annuity products, this study considers the extent to which existing U. <b>S.</b> private <b>annuity</b> markets provide retirees with inflation-protected retirement income flows. Although there is effectively no market yet for inflation-indexed annuities in the United States, such products are available in other countries.

40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} alike have developed numerous techniques for bench-marking investment returns to properly account for excessive levels of risk. The same, however, {{can not be}} said for liquidity, or the lack thereof. This paper devel-ops a model for analyzing the ex ante liquidity premium demanded by the holder of an illiquid annuity. In the U. <b>S.,</b> an <b>annuity</b> is an insurance product that is akin to a pension savings account with both an accumulation and decumulation phase. We compute the yield (spread) needed to compensate for the utility welfare loss, which is induced by the inability to rebalance and maintain an optimal portfolio when holding an annuity. Our analysis goes beyond the current literature, by focusing on the interaction between time horizon (both deterministic and stochastic), risk aversion and pre-existing portfolio holdings. More specifically, we derive a negative relationship between a greater level of individual risk aversion and the demanded liquidit...|$|R

Despite a clear need for basic biological information on juvenile rockfish life history, there have been very few efforts to describe distribution and habitat of this life stage, particularly along the Oregon coast.

40|$|Excerpt] Retirement annuities for {{civilian}} federal employees are provided mainly through two programs: the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS). Under {{both of these}} systems, retirement annuities are financed {{through a combination of}} employee and employer contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). All assets of the CSRDF are invested in U. S. Treasury bonds and other securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U. <b>S.</b> government. Retirement <b>annuities</b> for federal employees are paid from the CSRDF regardless of whether the benefits were accrued under CSRS or FERS. FERS annuities are fully funded by the sum of employee and employer contributions and interest earned by the Treasury bonds held by the CSRDF. The federal government makes supplemental payments into the CSRDF on behalf of employees covered by the CSRS because employee and agency contributions and interest earnings do not meet the full cost of the benefits earned by employees covered by that system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the development of}} private annuity markets in the United States. Annuities constituted a small share of the U.

First, concerns about {{the stability of the}} financial system drove investors to products offered by insurance companies, which were perceived to be stable institutions. Flexible payment deferred annuities, which permit investors to save and accumulate assets as well as draw down principal, grew rapidly in this period. Second, the group annuity market for corporate pension plans began to develop in the 1930 <b>s.</b> The group <b>annuity</b> market grew more rapidly than the individual annuity market for several decades after World War II. The most recent development in the annuity marketplace has been the rapid expansion of variable annuities. These annuity products combine the investment features of mutual funds with the tax deferral available for life insurance products. Variable annuity premium payments increased by a factor of five in the most recent five years for which data are available. ...|$|R
