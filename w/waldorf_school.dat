25|$|The Detroit <b>Waldorf</b> <b>School</b> {{was founded}} in 1965 by Rudolf and Amelia Wilhelm, who wanted to provide Detroiters more choices in educating their children. Other private schools in the area {{at the time were}} not integrated, and the Wilhelms and their {{supporters}} sought to provide a diverse educational experience to children. The school approached the board of the Central United Methodist Church about allocating space to open a nursery school. An impassioned speech by African-American Junius Harris, where he reminded Board members that families of color had far fewer educational choices for their children, convinced the board to allow the Waldorf nursery school to open in their building. The school opened as a nursery school in the Central United Methodist Church in 1965, and was deliberatley integrated from its founding. However, space in the church was limited, and later that year the school acquired the just-vacated Liggett campus. Classes for elementary students began at the present school building in September 1966. The Detroit <b>Waldorf</b> <b>School</b> {{was one of the first}} nine Waldorf schools in North America, and a founding member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).|$|E

25|$|<b>Waldorf</b> <b>schools</b> build close {{learning}} communities, {{founded on}} the shared values of its members, in ways {{that can lead to}} transformative learning experiences that allow all participants, including parents, to become more aware of their own individual path, but which at times also risk becoming exclusive. Reports from small-scale studies suggest that there are lower levels of harassment and bullying in <b>Waldorf</b> <b>schools</b> and that European Waldorf students have extremely lower rates of xenophobia and gender stereotypes than students in any other type of schools. Betty Reardon, a professor and peace researcher, gives <b>Waldorf</b> <b>schools</b> as an example of schools that follow a philosophy based on peace and tolerance.|$|R
