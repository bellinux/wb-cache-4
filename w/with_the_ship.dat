5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually {{considered to have}} been buried <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. Alternatively, he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E

5|$|According to Leutnant zur See Hans-Otto Brodt, their {{commanding}} officer Korvettenkapitän Heinz Bucholz and another 50 {{men of the}} crew of 64, went down <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The prisoners {{were sent to the}} sick bay for treatment of shock and exposure and supplied with fresh clothing that had been provided by the Red Cross. Until Omaha put in at Bahia, on 15 February, where they debarked and were transported to Recife, the Germans were placed under armed guard.|$|E
5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> at 84°4′N, {{the pair}} finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt {{to leave the}} ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to sledges had forced them to return after {{travelling}} short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in the following season.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} aboard {{is in some}} doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in The Times. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54seamen (all ranks), 7women, 13children {{and at least one}} male civilian, but these numbers cannot be substantiated, as muster rolls and books were lost <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that the crew had gone down <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a rebuttal by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{unable to}} {{decrease}} speed below warp 5, and the warp core reaching dangerous levels, Columbia and Commander Tucker rendezvous to provide assistance. However the crew realise that the transporter {{cannot be used}} at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on Enterprise, Tucker successfully performs a rapid non-standard cold boot on the warp engine, which purges the Klingon subroutines.|$|E

Seven {{members of the}} United States' Bureau of Standards traveled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> from New York and observed the operations, which were conducted in the Gulf of Guacanayabo. After dropping the Americans off in Guantánamo Bay, São Paulo returned home in early 1920. August 1920 saw the dreadnought sailing to Belgium, where King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth were embarked on 1 September {{to bring them to}} Brazil. After bringing the royals home, São Paulo traveled to Portugal to bring the remains of the former emperor Pedro II and his wife, Teresa Cristina, back to Brazil.|$|E

With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in the event that she needed to be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 onwards, other railway {{companies}} received concessions for {{the northern}} railway lines of the Netherlands. NoordNed, a joint venture of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Arriva, provided the railway services to and from Winschoten between 2000 and 2005. The Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed for major renovations in the years 2000–2002. Arriva bought all shares of NoordNed in 2003, and rebranded the services as Arriva in 2005. In 2013–2015, the station building was restored to its state of 1904 {{as part of a}} larger project to improve the quality and functionality of the station area. Between December 2015 and October 2016, the Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed entirely after a railway bridge near Weener was destroyed in a collision <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> Emsmoon. Until the bridge is replaced in 2021, Arriva is providing a rail replacement bus service between Weener and Leer. In 2016–2017, the roofed bus station was demolished and the bus area was modernized.|$|E

For {{most of the rest of}} the war both cruisers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad and support for the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid—1944. Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but were repaired during the war.|$|E
