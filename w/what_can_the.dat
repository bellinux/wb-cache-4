2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] {{and be able to}} talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was not be <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> college offer but <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Committed, by the 1920s, to {{a highly}} {{personalized}} pacifist socialism, Aderca veered toward the far-left of politics: in Idei și oameni, he chided Romanian reformism, moderate Marxism as personified by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the Second International. He decried the exploitation of workers and luxuries such as the casinos of Sinaia. Nonetheless, Crohmălniceanu, a Marxist, noted that Moartea unei republici roșii told little about how [...] "a new society is to be organized". Aderca favored [...] "a nonconformism of a mostly moral and aesthetic kind", where sexual freedom, creative liberty and the celebration Aderca approved of class conflict, with Marxism as a legitimiate tool of the masses: [...] "war is a creation of masters fighting each other for dominance. [...] <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> impoverished people {{have in common with}} the polite master? The French worker, what does he stand to gain from this war, other than a more thorough understanding of Marxism?" [...] Aderca's leftist leanings were incompatible with the neoliberalism of his mentor Eugen Lovinescu, something acknowledged by Aderca in his Mic tratat years. In Mărturia unei generații, Aderca challenged Lovinescu to answer on the subject. Lovinescu did so, noting that Sburătoruls celebration of individualism outweighed the neoliberal stance of its leader. In Aderca's work, socialism was doubled by a sarcastic view of traditional authority. Police officers opened a file on him when, in 1927, he mocked King Ferdinand I as a standard of barber shop posters. According to Dumitru Hîncu, although the comment irritated state security, it was not truly [...] "an attack on State institutions or its leaders".|$|E
2500|$|The prayer [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{has some}} difficulties. The Greek version adds a rubric before it: [...] "Here he names the dead". <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{have to do}} with the dead? The Antiochene Liturgy, in which several {{parallel}} passages to the modern Canon have already been noticed, has a parallel to the second half of this prayer too, and that parallel occurs in its commemoration of the dead. There, following a prayer that the dead may rest [...] "in the land of the living, in thy kingdom [...] [...] [...] in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", etc., is found this continuation: [...] "And keep for us in peace, O Lord, a Christian, well-pleasing and sinless end to our lives, gathering us under the feet of thy Elect, when Thou willest and as Thou willest, only without shame and offence; through thy only begotten Son our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ." [...] We notice here the reference to the elect (in electorum tuorum grege), the prayer that we may be kept [...] "in peace" [...] (in tuâ pace disponas), the allusion to the [...] "end of our lives" [...] (diesque nostros) and the unusual [...] "Per Christum Dominum nostrum", making a break in the middle of the Eucharistic prayer. The Syrian form with its plain reference to death ("the end of our lives") seems more clearly to be a continuation of a prayer for the faithful departed. But in the Roman form too is found such a reference in the words about hell (ab æterna damnatione) and heaven (in electorum tuorum grege).|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} God had already {{informed}} Moses that Pharaoh {{would not allow}} the Israelites to go, as in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I know that the King of Egypt will not allow you to go," [...] and in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I will harden his heart." [...] But Moses did not keep this in mind, but came instead to doubt the wisdom of God's decree, and began to argue with God, saying in [...] "Lord, why have You dealt ill with this people?" [...] For this reason, the Attribute of Justice sought to attack Moses, as [...] says: [...] "And God spoke to Moses" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , Elohim) indicative of God's Justice). But when God reflected that Moses only asked this because of Israel's suffering, God retracted and dealt with Moses according to the Attribute of Mercy, as [...] says: [...] "And He said to him: ‘I am the Lord'" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton) indicative of God's Mercy). The Midrash viewed the question of Moses in [...] as an application of Ecclesiastes [...] "And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> man do who comes after the King? even that which has been already done." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] refers to both Solomon and Moses. The Midrash taught that [...] refers to Solomon, for God gave some commandments for kings, as it says in [...] "Only he shall not multiply horses to himself [...] [...] [...] Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away; neither silver and gold." [...] Solomon read in [...] that the reason of God's decree was [...] "that his heart turn not away." [...] The Midrash taught that Solomon thus thought to himself that he would multiply his wives but still not allow his heart to turn away. And the Midrash taught that [...] refers to Moses because Moses began to argue with God in [...] "Lord, why have you dealt ill with this people?" [...] On account of this, the Midrash taught that {{at that point the}} wisdom and knowledge of Moses was only (in the words of [...] ) [...] "madness and folly." [...] The Midrash asked what right Moses had to question God's ways and in the words of [...] "that which had been already done" [...] that God had revealed to him.|$|E
