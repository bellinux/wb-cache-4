40|$|Direct impact Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar systems offer many potential advantages over <b>split</b> Hopkinson pressure <b>bars,</b> including access to higher strain rates, higher strains for equivalent striker velocity and system length, lower dispersion and faster achievement of force equilibrium. Currently advantages are gained at a significant cost: {{the fact that}} input bar data is unavailable removes all information about the striker impacted specimen face, preventing the determination of force equilibrium, and requiring approximations {{to be made on}} the sample deformation history. Recently photon Doppler velocimetry methods have been developed, which can replace strain gauges on Hopkinson bars. In this paper we discuss an experimental method and complementary data analysis for using Doppler velocimetry to measure surface velocities of the striker and output bars in a direct impact bar experiment, allowing similar data to be recorded as in a <b>split</b> <b>bar</b> system, with the same level of convenience. We discuss extracting velocity and force measurements, and improving the accuracy and convenience of Doppler velocimetry on Hopkinson bars. Results obtained using the technique are compared to equivalent <b>split</b> <b>bar</b> tests, showing improved stress measurements for the lowest and highest strains...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of ultrafine-grained (UFG) and coarse-grained commercially pure aluminum was characterized in tension at {{a wide range}} of strain rates using the tensile Hopkinson <b>Split</b> <b>Bar</b> (THSB) technique and a servohydraulic materials testing machine. Sheet UFG aluminum specimens were wire EDM cut from large equal channel angular pressed (ECAP) ingots, manufactured using the route C+Bc. UFG aluminum is prone to necking at very low strain levels due to its inability to strain harden. Although necking commences almost immediately after yielding, the material is capable of deforming plastically to relatively large plastic strains before final failure. One problem with the tensile Hopkinson <b>Split</b> <b>Bar</b> method with dog-bone specimens is the inaccurate strain measurement due to the deformation taking place outside the specimen gauge section. Strain measurement inaccuracy can, however, be overcome by monitoring the deformation with the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, which gives the full field strain distribution of the sample surface. In this work, Aramis® 3 D image correlation software with two digital high speed cameras was used for the full field strain measurements. Accurate strain measurement enables, among other things, determination of the strain rate distribution and dynamical necking {{behavior of}} the specimen. The UFG material is shown to strain harden during necking at high strain rates, although the strain hardening rate is not enough to postpone the necking at room temperature...|$|R

An adhesive is tested in tension, compression and shear with a <b>Split</b> Hopkinson Tension <b>Bar</b> (SHTB) and a Direct Impact <b>Split</b> Hopkinson Pressure <b>Bar</b> (Direct SHPB). Specifically developed sample geometries and corresponding experimental setups are briefly presented.
