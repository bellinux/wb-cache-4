500|$|You Are the Apple of My Eye {{is based}} on Giddens' semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. He changed some details of the story to make the film more dramatic; for example, Ching-teng and Chia-yi's fight {{actually}} took place over the phone, not in the rain as depicted. Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me. Also, if the film is not nice, it will be a letdown to Chen-tung and Michelle, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> so hard".|$|E
2500|$|The exact size of Chunchucmil is {{currently}} being studied using aerial photography, satellite imagery, and survey transects by the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project (<b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> at Chunchucmil since the mid-1990s, {{under the direction of}} Dr. Bruce H. Dahlin). [...] Estimates range from 25km² for the more compact urban settlement to around 64km² for the city and its adjoining suburbs and farmsteads. In either case, this places the site of Chunchucmil among some {{of the largest and most}} densely settled ancient Maya polities.|$|E

2500|$|Ori and the Blind Forest was {{developed}} by Moon Studios, a worldwide collaboration of designers and programmers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on the game four years before it was released, with Microsoft acquiring the game {{about a year after}} development started. One of the lead team members is Thomas Mahler, an artist formerly working with Blizzard Entertainment. According to Microsoft producer Daniel Smith, Moon Studios is not located in any one location, but instead staffers can be found throughout the world, from Austria to Australia and Israel to the United States. Gameplay programmer David Clark described the team as being inspired by current and classic adventure games, notably the Rayman and Metroid franchises, and that Ori is intended as a [...] "love letter" [...] to those games.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{contestant}} and runner-up Saira Khan has criticised the programme {{because the}} final two candidates both work with Sir Alan Sugar {{for a few months}} before he decides whom he will hire. Khan stated that [...] "Sir Alan Sugar's final decision is not based on the programme that people see, his final decision is based on these two people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> with him for the six months." [...] Khan also said that the show is more concerned with giving viewers a rags-to-riches ending than employing the most able candidate, and that the show promotes bullying in the workplace. The series has been notably edited afterwards to show the winner in a different light. This has led to some viewers correctly guessing the winner of the series partway through the series.|$|E

6000|$|... "We hide it. It {{would never}} do to enter a village with ten or twelve pounds' weight of silver, and {{three or four times}} as much lead, for the headman might take it into his head to have us searched. So we {{generally}} dig a hole {{at the foot of a}} tree, in some quiet spot; and take, perhaps, a pound of silver and two or three of lead with us. A gift of half that silver is enough to convince the headman that we are honest fellows, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> hard since we went away; and from time to time we can go to our store and get what we want from it, and can build a house and marry, and take up a field or two, and perhaps become headmen ourselves, before very long." ...|$|E

"All this, of course, {{appears to}} me true and relevant; but I cannot help feeling that it is, after all, but a poor piece of quackery to comment on a {{multitude}} of phenomena without adverting to the principle which lies at the root, and gives the true meaning to them all. Now this principle I seem to myself {{to find in the}} state of mind which is attributed to Teufelsdrockh; in his state of mind, I say, not in his opinions, though these are, in him as in all men, most important,--being one of the best indices to his state of mind. Now what distinguishes him, not merely from the greatest and best men who have been on earth for eighteen hundred years, but from the whole body of those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> forwards towards the good, and have been the salt and light of the world, is this: That he does not believe in a God. Do not be indignant, I am blaming no one;--but if I write my thoughts, I must write them honestly.|$|E
60|$|An {{order of}} the day {{appeared}} yesterday thanking the pioneer force and Colonel Field at Senafe for their efforts. There are many remarks down here upon the fact that while the officers and men who marched up to Senafe, and have passed a comparatively quiet and pleasant time up there, have been thanked, there should be no word of praise for the men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> almost night and day down here. If any praise was to be given, it has certainly been earned by the men who have borne the heat and burden of the bad times at Zulla. This morning the mountain-guns, made at Woolwich, were out for practice. These guns have been fully described in the columns of the English press, I need not therefore enter into any details. The practice with shell was very fair, the little guns throwing the shell, which are nearly half their own length, with great precision, at 2000 yards. They appeared to me, however, to throw rather to the right. The troops were also out at exercise, and an order has been issued that all the regiments shall go for a march out every morning. This is as it should be: it will keep the men in health, and prepare them, to a certain extent, for the hard work they will probably have to go through when they once start.|$|E
