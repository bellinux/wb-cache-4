500|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} to adapt [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into an animated film {{soon after the}} studio released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, but the project was ultimately abandoned when the story {{turned out to be}} [...] "a really hard nut to crack". According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glen Keane, the film's {{original}} director, {{first began}} working on the story for what became Tangled about 14 years prior to its release, then directed the film's development from 2002 to 2008. In October 2003, the film was announced as Rapunzel Unbraided, as a computer animated feature scheduled for a 2007 release which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine {{to get out of}} the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." [...] In November 2005, Unbraided was pushed back to a summer 2009 release in order to give Keane [...] "more time to work on the story." [...] According to Ed Catmull, at one point Michael Eisner himself had proposed using modern-day San Francisco as the initial setting at the start of the film and then somehow transporting the heroine into a fairy tale world, but Keane could not make that idea work. [...] The film was shut down about a week before Catmull and John Lasseter were placed in charge of the studio in January 2006, and one of their first decisions was to restart the project and ask Keane to keep going with the film. It had originally been announced in April 2007 that Annie-nominated animator and story artist Dean Wellins would be co-directing the film alongside Glen Keane. On October 9, 2008, it was reported that Keane and Wellins had stepped down as directors due to other commitments, and were replaced by the team of Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, director and storyboard director, respectively, of Disney's 2008 animated feature Bolt. Keane stayed on as an executive producer and animation supervisor, while Wellins moved on to developing other short and feature films. After the film's release, Keane revealed that he had [...] "stepped back" [...] from the role of director because of a heart attack in 2008.|$|E

60|$|So I {{called to}} Hans, who was hanging about {{with a rifle}} on his arm, to follow with a cloth and soap, of which {{fortunately}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> pieces left, and we started along {{what had once been}} a paved roadway running between stone houses, whereof the time-eaten ruins still remained on either side.|$|E

"Yes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{years with}} rain a-plenty, and {{that brought a}} boom in settlement; {{everything}} along the river was homesteaded, and so I retreated--the range was overstocked anyhow. This time I climbed high. I reckon I'm all right now while I live. They can't raise co'n in this high country, and not much of anything but grass. They won't bother us no mo'. It's a good cattle country, but a mighty tough range to ride, as you'll find.

I know you were {{accustomed}} to boats, and I did some rowing when I was a young man. I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Canadian Indians with us, or of half-breeds; they are up {{to this sort of}} work, and with one in the stern of each canoe it would be a much less risky business going down the rapids. However, no doubt we shall get handy with the paddles before long." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jim {{examined}} the walls. [...] "There {{would not be}} much difficulty in working through them if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> good knives, they are made of sun-dried bricks. However, we will hunt about among this rubbish {{and see if we}} can find some more bits of iron. Anyhow, we can wait a day or two before we make up our minds about it and see what comes of it. I vote we clear up this litter a bit, and chuck it out through the opening. There is a close, musty smell in the place. The opening will be very handy for chucking everything out and keeping the place as clean as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We despised the Indians {{on our own}} side, and our {{commander}} made {{light of}} them and their service. Our officers disgusted the chiefs who were with us by outrageous behaviour to their women. There were not above seven or eight who remained with our force. Had <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred in our front on that fatal 9th of July, the event of the day {{must have been very}} different. They would have flung off the attack of the French Indians; they would have prevented the surprise and panic which ensued. 'Tis known now that the French had even got ready to give up their fort, never dreaming of the possibility of a defence, and that the French Indians themselves remonstrated against the audacity of attacking such an overwhelming force as ours.|$|E

These things are hardly their fault. But, I say, Mettie, now you are come, and it is all right, do you think I might go to St. Matthew's?

60|$|By {{that time}} {{my life was}} set fully upon its present courses, Gidding and I had passed from the stage of talking and scheming to {{definite}} undertakings. Indeed by 1909 things were already organized upon their present lines. We had developed a huge publishing establishment with one big printing plant in Barcelona and another in Manchester, and we were studying the peculiar difficulties that might attend {{the establishment of a}} third plant in America. Our company was an English company under the name of Alphabet and Mollentrave, and we were rapidly making it the broadest and steadiest flow of publication the world had ever seen. Its streams already reached further and carried more than any single firm had ever managed to do before. We were reprinting, in as carefully edited and revised editions as we could, the whole of the English, Spanish and French literature, and we were only waiting for the release of machinery to attack German, Russian and Italian, and were giving each language not only its own but a very complete series of good translations of the classical writers in every other tongue. We had a little band of editors and translators permanently in our service at each important literary centre. We had, for example, more than a score of men at work translating Bengali fiction and verse into English,--a lot of that new literature is wonderfully illuminating to an intelligent Englishman--and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> men hunting about for new work in Arabic. We meant to give so good and cheap a book, and to be so comprehensive in our choice of books, excluding nothing if only it was real and living, on account of any inferiority of quality, obscurity of subject or narrowness of demand, {{that in the long run}} anybody, anywhere, desiring to read anything would turn naturally and inevitably to our lists.|$|E

It's {{definitely going to be}} more of the uptempo, fun, energetic vibe that you've heard on 'Break Your Heart', 'Higher' and 'Dynamite'.

It is the third track on their 2010 album Brothers and was {{released}} as the record's first single on April 23, 2010. Dan Auerbach told The Sun how the song originated: [...] "That was the last song we did for the record. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days off and so did Brian (Danger Mouse) and since we are friends and like hanging out with each other {{we thought it would}} be fun to go into the studio and see if we could come up with a tune.

5000|$|Sue and Sunny {{themselves}} {{are a little}} unsure of how many records they have actually released.

But nothing really happened for us". In fact they appear to have recorded around a dozen singles, but to confuse things further they also recorded under the names Sue & Sunshine, The Stockingtops, and as part of The Nirvana Orchestra. They also recorded an album for CBS which was, confusingly, also released - with a different cover - on the CBS subsidiary, Reflection.|$|E
5000|$|The series used 50 horses, {{trained by}} Matt Chew at Santa Anita.
