Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as <b>well.</b> <b>Today,</b> the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E

However, various attempts to preserve Kam culture and language have been very successful, and improving living conditions in rural Guizhou may entice local Kam villagers to stay rather than move to major urban areas.|$|E

25|$|Defining a German nation {{based on}} {{internal}} characteristics presented difficulties.

Ironically, the value of one copy today is more money than Poe ever made in his lifetime. Its rarity was recognized in 1925, when the Saturday Evening Post ran an article titled [...] "Have You A Tamerlane in Your Attic"? After the article ran, a woman in Worcester, Massachusetts named Ada S. Dodd searched and found a copy, prompting others to search as <b>well.</b> <b>Today,</b> most of the surviving copies are owned by libraries and museums. Two copies, for example, were purchased by The Huntington Library in New York in 1915. One copy is on display as part of the collection at the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia. Though copies do not circulate often, they command high prices when they do. One sold at auction for $125,000 and, later, another sold for $198,000.|$|E
500|$|The word archaea {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek , meaning [...] "ancient things", as the first representatives of the domain Archaea were methanogens and {{it was assumed that}} their {{metabolism}} reflected Earth's primitive atmosphere and the organisms' antiquity. For a long time, archaea were seen as extremophiles that only exist in extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes. However, as new habitats were studied, more organisms were discovered. Extreme halophilic and hyperthermophilic microbes were also included in the Archaea. By the end of the 20th century, archaea had been identified in non-extreme environments as <b>well.</b> <b>Today,</b> they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms that are widely distributed in nature and are common in all habitats. This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes. This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not been cultured in the laboratory.|$|E
500|$|The Hippocratic {{school of}} {{medicine}} described well the ailments of the human rectum and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. Hemorrhoids, for instance, though believed {{to be caused by}} an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways. Cautery and excision are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: ligating the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron. Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as <b>well.</b> <b>Today,</b> [...] "treatment [...] still includes burning, strangling, and excising." [...] Also, some of the fundamental concepts of proctoscopy outlined in the Corpus are still in use. For example, the uses of the rectal speculum, a common medical device, are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus. This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to endoscopy. Hippocrates often used lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to treat diseases such as diabetes, what is today called lifestyle medicine. He is often quoted with [...] "Let food be your medicine, and medicine be your food" [...] and [...] "Walking is man's best medicine", however the quote [...] "Let food be your medicine" [...] appears to be an apparent misquotation and its exact origin remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as <b>well.</b> <b>Today,</b> I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E
500|$|The visuals and {{presentation}} {{were one of}} the most praised aspects of the game. After the game was released, Rob Swan from Computer and Video Games asserted that the graphics were an excellent example of what the then-new SNES was capable of, while in the same review, Paul Glancey similarly remarked that the visuals were stunning and was grateful that the game came free with the console. Four reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly echoed this by commenting that the game did not take much advantage of the SNES's capabilities compared to other titles available for the system. Retrospective reviewers agreed that the game's visuals were still of high quality. Karn Bianco from Cubed3 enjoyed the game's relaxed visual style and praised Nintendo for keeping everything [...] "nice and simple" [...] for designing a game perfect for children. IGN's Lucas Thomas heralded the game as a significant leap over the visuals of the 8-bit era, but in retrospect felt that it did not distinguish itself from being a graphically-upgraded continuation of its predecessor, Super Mario Bros. 3. In contrast, Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com thought that the game brought out the full potential of the SNES (albeit less so than Donkey Kong Country), and Nadia Oxford from USGamer too felt that the game was a less rigid version of its predecessor. AllGames Skyler Miller and Alex Navarro from GameSpot both praised the game's well-drawn characters, colourful visuals and pleasing animation. Morgan Sleeper of Nintendo Life said that Super Mario World was the [...] "graphical holy grail" [...] that retro-styled games aspire to, and insisted that its design holds up <b>well</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{personal}} {{names on}} the Tanais Tablets are considered as a proto-type of a certain ethnonym of a Sarmatian tribe those persons did descend from, and as <b>well</b> <b>today</b> is generally accepted that the Croatian name is of Iranian origin {{and that can be}} traced to the Tanains Tablets. However, the etymology itself is not enough strong evidence. The theory is further explained with the Avar's destruction of Antes tribal polity in 602, and that the early Croats migration and subsequent war with Avars in Dalmatia (during the reign of Heraclius 610-641) can be seen as continuation of war between Antes and Avars. That the early Croats marked the cardinal directions with colors, hence White Croats and White Croatia (Western) and Red Croatia (Southern), but the cardinal color designation in general indicates remnants of the widespread steppe peoples tradition.
