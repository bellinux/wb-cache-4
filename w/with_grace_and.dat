5|$|Matt {{returns to}} Genoa City with a reconstructed face, rapes Sharon once more, and is {{eventually}} captured. When Sharon ends up pregnant, {{it is unknown}} who the father is: Nick or Matt. An argument with Nick causes Sharon {{to give birth to}} a stillborn daughter, which is revealed to be Nick's following her death. Nick and Sharon's marriage weakens further when they both cheat on each other once more, Nick <b>with</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>and</b> Sharon with the Newman stableman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Nick tries to forgive her, but when he witnesses Sharon and Victor kissing, things become harder to mend than ever. Sharon later runs away from town, depressed. When she returns, Nick accepts her and they reunite. However, a man named Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) who physically abused her (after having an affair with her) followed Sharon to Genoa City, wanting to bed her again. Eventually, Cameron's schemes are foiled and Sharon and Nick return to their normal life at last. In 2005, a fourteen-year-old rebellious Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick closes off his emotions and cheats on Sharon with his Newman Enterprises work friend Phyllis Summers. Phyllis ends up pregnant, with Jack or Nick as possible fathers. The original DNA test to determine the child's paternity returns inconclusive, but the thought of losing another child leads Nick into lying, and claiming that he is Summer's father. Nick and Sharon divorce after an eleven-year marriage and he marries Phyllis instead. Their daughter, Summer Newman, is born. Sharon also moves on with her life, marrying Jack, which makes Nick feel uncomfortable. In 2007, Nick's flight on the Newman jet crashes and a body is never recovered; he is presumed dead, devastating his family and Sharon.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 & 4 June 1870. <b>With</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>and</b> his brothers E.M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly {{became one of}} the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6–86 and 6–20. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire.|$|E

This kind of action seems to bring him luck, for a play {{that he had been}} unable to dispose of is sold for a good sum and he starts on the high road to prosperity. Ten years later when the girl is grown to womanhood, John finds that he is deeply in love with his ward, but does not betray his passion, believing that it is hopeless. His eyes are opened, however, by Will, who is in love <b>with</b> <b>Grace,</b> <b>and</b> is told by her when she refuses him that she loves John.

500|$|Others claim Native American mascots {{help promote}} the culture {{to those who}} might be unaware of its significance.

However, the tribal costume was not of the Illinois Confederation, but that of the Lakota tribe. The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by former Chief Illiniwek portrayer's to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) [...] "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture".|$|E

He made nine appearances for the county during the 1873 and 1874 seasons, achieving a highest score of 49, averaging 17.40 with the bat and taking two wickets. His first score of over fifty runs in first-class matches came for the United South of England XI, for whom he continued to play regularly, against the United North of England XI in 1874.

500|$|Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton {{describe}} de Lucía as a [...] "titanic {{figure in}} the world of flamenco guitar", highlighting his [...] "astounding technique and inventiveness" [...] and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as [...] "the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness. He's proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing <b>with</b> <b>grace</b> <b>and</b> elegance, yet able to reveal great power." [...] Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his [...] "deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation." [...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when used properly, {{can be one of the}} most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of the most incredible music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world." [...] In 2015, Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: [...] "The virtuoso intrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.". In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music. On December 21, 2016, Google commemorated the anniversary of de Lucia's birth with a Google Doodle shown in Spain, Mexico, and several South American nations.|$|E
