500|$|The {{four-year}} {{association with}} Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The {{first of the}} major works was the orchestral A Song of Summer, based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of A Poem of Life and Love. In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to [...] "imagine that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> on the cliffs in the heather, {{looking out over the}} sea". This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of Walt Whitman poems with the title Songs of Farewell, was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: [...] "the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings..." [...] combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its [...] "hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in A Mass of Life". Payne describes the work as [...] "bracing and exultant, with in places an almost Holstian clarity".|$|E

Hermansson criticised the lack of diversity in Sveriges Radio's selection of hosts for the show, saying [...] "It makes me terribly angry to see how very white <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> here. We do not represent Sweden," [...] referring to those attending the press conference for the show. Hermansson also said that she was shocked at how [...] "Swedish" [...] the whole event was. Journalist Mustafa Can criticised Hermansson's comments {{in an article in the}} Aftonbladet newspaper.|$|E

60|$|In the evening, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> around Hancock's fire, {{an officer}} came in.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in the porch, {{waiting for}} Dick {{to come by}} the white path across the field.|$|R

60|$|For {{the moment}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> listening, amid bursts of applause, to our treasurer's statement. As {{we hear it}} we realise that this Peace Kermesse has proved the {{culmination}} and crown of four winters' war work.|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{know as well}} as I do {{that these}} tiffin-rooms where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> now have been in {{existence}} for many years. Well, next day about twelve o’clock, Davidson dropped in here to get something to eat.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> at our {{editorial}} desk in {{our inner}} room, quietly writing up our week's poetry, when a stranger looked in upon us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not tired. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> down a good deal. I didn't {{think how}} late it was. I'm ever so much better. Where's Lottie?" ...|$|R
60|$|One day, {{some months}} afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{in our little}} salon in a Paris hotel when a card was sent up, which Marian took.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] snapped Grandfather Frog. [...] "I never did, but I {{know all}} about him. He is a great worker, is this big cousin of yours, and he builds dams like this one <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> on." ...|$|E

60|$|And as we listen, the cry grows fainter and fainter in {{our ears}} and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> here {{again in the}} leather chairs of the Mausoleum Club, talking of the little Town in the Sunshine that once we knew.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, Toomuch Koffi had {{advanced}} across the broad flagstones {{of the hall}} where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting.</b> With hands lifted he salaamed four times--east, west, north, and south.|$|R

6000|$|... "Knickerbocker," [...] I said earnestly, [...] "Father Knickerbocker, don't {{you know}} that {{something}} is happening, that this very evening as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> here in all this riot, the President of the United States is to come before Congress on the most solemn mission that ever--" ...|$|E
60|$|His Lordship came in as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> down, {{bursting}} with some news, {{and he could}} hardly wait to congratulate Dolly on her recovery before he delivered it.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} of the {{narrative}} the landlord paused, and, turning toward {{the window of the}} room in which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting,</b> looked {{in the direction of the}} stable-yard.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{together}} silently, he {{in a very}} moody {{and bitter}} humor. He had his pistol lying across his knees, {{as he used to}} do at that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "In this {{position}} I can watch your face," [...] he said. [...] "Usually when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> or standing together I only half see your eyes. They hide themselves under those shady lashes like violets under their leaves. Now I can look straight up into them and read all their secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever so much better!" [...] said Euphemia. [...] "Now we {{know what}} Nature is. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> right down in her lap, and she is cuddling us up.

6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] he said, [...] "this {{meeting of}} our Inner Council you {{yourself}} have pronounced an wholly informal one. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> here with closed doors. We are all, I believe, patriots and Thetians. Let me ask your Majesty, therefore, if every means {{have been tried}} to avoid the destruction which threatens us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He disappeared," [...] I answered, [...] "as {{though by}} magic. You see, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{at the table}} next the door, and he had every {{opportunity}} for slipping out unnoticed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However, {{all that}} was changed, and changed under the strangest circumstances. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting,</b> Gallon and I, on the piazza of the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo--you know the Galle Face?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} {{he was all}} right. Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> down to supper, we heard a cat squalling outside. Montgomery flung a three-pound tin of the cio-root at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have made}} a discovery. I have {{discovered}} that the provisions will not last us another week; that our vigour {{is not what it}} used to be; that a sort of apathy is stealing over us all; that the sands of life, in short, are running out while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> idle here making no effort to help ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} sound," [...] he cried. [...] "I {{see it all}} again. Look, can't you see them? It's Massachusetts {{soldiers}} marching South to the war--can't you hear the beating of the drums and the shrill calling of the fife--the regiments from the North, the first to come. I saw them pass, here where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting,</b> sixty years ago--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jacinta. [...] "I do {{not think}} I shall go to-morrow, so you need not call for me. I have {{scrambled}} through the Mercedes Wood several times already, and we came here to be quiet. That is why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> outside to-night. There are two or three tiresome people in the house who will insist upon talking." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of our arrival <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in the Colonel's gun-room after dinner, Holmes {{stretched}} upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked over his little armory of Eastern weapons.|$|R
60|$|Last night, for instance, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in the loggia after supper. Pasiance was {{fingering}} {{the strings of}} her violin, and suddenly Dan (a bold thing for him) asked her to play.|$|R
60|$|At length the end {{came very}} suddenly. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> one evening by Mr. Carson's bedside in his hut, when to our astonishment {{he sat up}} and spoke in a strong, full voice.|$|R
