25|$|Some {{have argued}} that the outcome of the Mỹ Lai courts-martial failed to uphold the laws of war {{established}} in the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals. For example, Telford Taylor, senior American prosecutor at Nuremberg, wrote that legal principles established at the war crimes trials could have been used to prosecute senior American military commanders for failing to prevent atrocities such as the one at My Lai. The Secretary of the Army Howard Callaway was quoted in The New York Times as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley honestly believed that what he did was a part of his orders—a rationale that contradicts the standards set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, where following orders was not a defense for committing war crimes. On the <b>whole,</b> <b>other</b> than the My Lai courts-martial, there were thirty six military trials held by the U.S. Army from January 1965 to August 1973 for crimes against civilians in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines.

Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{from both the}} gaming community and the comic book community was positive. UGO Networks praised the novel, citing the wealth of contributions from recognized artists {{and the strength of}} the material in fleshing out the Halo universe as the work's greatest strength.

Mike Deeley of Comics Bulletin lauded the book for the diverse range of storytelling and art styles that lent the Halo Graphic Novel the feel of an anthology yet still retained a cohesive <b>whole.</b> <b>Other</b> areas that received particular attention included Tsutomu Nihei's work on Breaking Quarantine for its vivid imagery and its focus on visual storytelling in lieu of any dialogue.|$|E

[...] On the <b>whole,</b> <b>other</b> reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view.

500|$|Later in 2010 when {{recording}} {{her third}} album, Here I Am (2011), Rowland credited both Guetta {{and the song}} for inspiring her to pursue a new sound.

Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him".

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent, {{with which}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined.

The Federal Arbitration Act was designed, he explained, to maintain the enforceability of contractual agreements. But private arbitration is a <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> situation. Stevens wrote, [...] "As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor’s opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts". He went on to quote the former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak in supporting the idea that the Court should look at the purpose of the act rather than its pure statutory language.|$|E
50|$|According {{to another}} version by H.H. Joachim, truth is a {{systematic}} coherence that {{involves more than}} logical consistency. In this view, a proposition is true {{to the extent that}} it is a necessary constituent of a systematically coherent <b>whole.</b> <b>Others</b> of this school of thought, for example, Brand Blanshard, hold that this whole must be so interdependent that every element in it necessitates and even entails every other element. Exponents of this view infer that the most complete truth is a property solely of a unique coherent system, called the absolute, and that humanly knowable propositions and systems have a degree of truth that is proportionate to how fully they approximate this ideal.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether regulatory announcements relating to competition, pricing {{policy and the}} quality of service in the water industry in England and Wales {{have an impact on the}} industry's systematic risk. The results indicate that, although the long-run overall effect of regulation on systematic risk appears to be negligible, competition and quality announcements can have a significant impact upon the industry's systematic risk. Further analysis of individual announcements and companies suggests that price announcements also significantly affect individual companies' systematic risk, although not in a uniform manner. This indicates that regulators need to be aware that, while some of their policy decisions tend to affect the industry as a <b>whole,</b> <b>others</b> have a diverse impact on individual companies. ...|$|R
