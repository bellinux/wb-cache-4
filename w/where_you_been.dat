2500|$|In February 2009, {{the band}} signed with indie label Jagjaguwar. The band's first release {{on the new}} label was titled Farm and {{released}} on June 23, 2009. Murph said the album was recorded at Mascis' home and marks return to the heavier, <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Been</b> LP era. The album was released to positive reviews. To promote the album, the band played Farms lead-off track, [...] "Pieces", on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on June 25, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Murph {{left the}} band after touring for <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Been</b> and was {{replaced}} for the band's live shows by George Berz, leaving Mascis as the sole remaining original member. However, the band's subsequent albums would be recorded mostly by JMascis on his own, playing everything except for the bass {{and some of the}} harmony vocals, which continued to be handled by Mike Johnson. [...] The commercial success continued with 1994's Without a Sound, which placed well in both the US and UK album charts. After 1997's Hand It Over, Mascis finally retired the Dinosaur Jr. name, with the group's final live performance being an appearance on the American talk show The Jenny Jones Show. In 1999, Mascis released the first of two solo albums under the name J Mascis + The Fog.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{found their}} live shows well {{received}} in the changing musical climate of the early 1990s, and decided to record new material with the new lineup. This time, the recording sessions were with full participation from Murph and Johnson, with the former playing most of the drums and the latter playing all of the bass parts, singing harmony vocals and even contributing a few guitar solos. This material represented {{the peak of the}} band's commercial success, with the single [...] "Start Choppin'" [...] reaching the top 20 in the UK, and the album that followed, <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Been,</b> reaching the UK top 10 and the US top 50. The opening track, [...] "Out There", had an accompanying video and was aired on MTV for a short time, as the show 120 Minutes was still popular as a late-night [...] "alternative" [...] video show. Although the new material was more accessible than the band's 1980s albums, in terms of playing it represented a partial return to the more unrestrained power-trio sound of the original lineup.|$|E
