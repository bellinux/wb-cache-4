25|$|The film's script {{went through}} a few drafts before a {{shooting}} script was finalized. The first version was much darker than the final film. Various scenes were cut, including one which portrayed Billy's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins, with her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives. Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted. There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy's dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a McDonald's, eating customers instead of burgers. Also, instead of Stripe being a mogwai who becomes a gremlin, there was originally no mogwai named Stripe; rather, Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin. Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo was cute and that audiences would <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present throughout the film.|$|E

500|$|The special {{was written}} {{with the goal}} of [...] "telling the story in the most honest and sincere way." [...] The writers {{attempted}} to continue the tense and unpleasant relationship between Frankie and Mr. Herriman, which they had begun developing since the series began, but approaching it in a believable and sensible fashion. With the heavy plot running through the special, the writers tried to use Bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it. They wrote Bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously, but did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cruel or malicious.|$|E
500|$|As Jason {{went through}} some {{characterization}} {{changes in the}} 2009 film, Derek Mears likens him more {{to a combination of}} John Rambo, Tarzan, and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes. To him, this Jason is similar to Rambo because he sets up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is more calculated because he feels that he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is meant to be more sympathetic in this film. Fuller and Form contend that {{they did not want to}} make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. As Brad Fuller explains, [...] "We do not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple." ...|$|E

He's {{got a lot of}} clients and people say they don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give you as much or as little attention as you want." [...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E

The actor told TV Guide's Maloney that he would miss his fellow cast members the most because he had become very close to them. However added that he was looking forward to a [...] "less hectic work schedules and a change of routine". He later told Desmond that [...] "the danger in staying in soap too long is that people start seeing you as that character." [...] Dickson revealed {{that the rest of the}} cast were behind the idea of Frank's exit storyline. They did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed off because that would have been [...] "too boring". She added that the serial's producer accepted their idea of Frank leaving [...] "with a bang".|$|E
500|$|The writers altered Jason's character. Mears {{describes}} him as {{a combination}} of John Rambo, Tarzan, and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes.

Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; {{he is supposed to}} be more sympathetic in this film. However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with [...] not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience.

500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: [...] "It's amazing {{to be a part of}} it", adding, [...] "I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome". The actor also explained that during his scenes, [...] "We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff and I felt like I had jetlag." [...] In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "jibbering wreck", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E

In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Cyrus {{said that she was}} [...] "going through [...] nine-hundred different emotions while trying to write [...] song" [...] and that her use of the word [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was. When Seacrest asked if she was worried the song's subject would hear it and be upset, Cyrus responded that while she was slightly worried, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upset.

500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever you want to write. If you <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his personal catcher, go right ahead.

500|$|Shearer {{was born}} December 23, 1943 in Los Angeles, {{the son of}} Dora Warren (née Kohn) (d. 2008), a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer. His parents were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Austria and Poland. Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later {{decided to make a}} career change and become a children's agent, as she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show The Jack Benny Program. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old. He described Jack Benny as [...] "very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy." [...] Shearer {{said in an interview that}} one person who [...] "took him under his wing" [...] and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor Mel Blanc, who voiced many animated characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Barney Rubble. Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, in which he only had a small part. Later that year, he made his first big film performance in The Robe. Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio. In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the Eddie Haskell character in the pilot episode of the television series Leave It to Beaver. After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.|$|E

500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So {{this is the end of}} an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E
500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as they did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing {{as an example of}} humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E
