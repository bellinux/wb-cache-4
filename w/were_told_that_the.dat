5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{candidates}} were informed {{of their success}} in an e-mail from NRP and were also sent various contracts to sign and return. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project would last for a year, so most of them gave up their flats and jobs. The contracts stated that their food, accommodation and leisure money would be provided, {{and that they were}} to meet in London on 10 June 2002 for the programme to begin filming. Each contestant was also told to set up a new bank account to which Russian could have access and to arrive without money or credit cards on the launch day.|$|E
5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} mainly used {{horses for}} logistical support; {{they were better}} than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than {{the loss of a}} human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short of horses.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to}} the editor printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E

25|$|The 203-strong force {{consisted}} of 12 commissioned officers, 15 {{men from the}} Royal Canadian Dragoons, 46 men from the Royal Canadian Artillery and 130 men from the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry. The force was formed up by asking for volunteers from the Permanent Force, who <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> task would last at least two years; the detachment proved popular, with many soldiers putting themselves forward for the detachment and, if necessary, extending their terms of service. It was commanded by acting Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Evans, a well-regarded officer based in Winnipeg, who had a background in managing cavalry, infantry and artillery.|$|E
25|$|The Lemba {{claim was}} also {{reported}} by a William Bolts (in 1777, to the Austrian Habsburg authorities), and by an A.A.

However, Gayre's thesis is not supported by more recent scholars such as Garlake or Pikirayi.|$|E
