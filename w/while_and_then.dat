5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation for a <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Arévalo Bermejo {{was born}} into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school teacher for a brief <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, {{the fact that he had}} chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{computational}} problems {{take the}} perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes {{the question for}} a <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where {{we do not want}} the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.|$|E
25|$|The Army Air Corps in the Far East {{had been}} {{centralised}} in 1969 when various flights, troops and Gurkha air platoons were amalgamated, {{resulting in the}} re-formation of No. 656 (Independent) Squadron AAC (656 Sqn) in October 1969. One Gurkha air platoon, based with the Gurkha battalion at Seria, remained as an air platoon for a <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> became C Flight 656 Sqn, then Brunei Detachment 660 Sqn in 1978, then C Flight 660 Sqn in 1979. The reorganization and increase in unit size required the squadron to be housed at Sek Kong.|$|E

His modus operandi was to buy a house in each new {{neighborhood}} that he helped establish, live in it for a <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> move to a new home in the next neighborhood that he founded. In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions and spoke in the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873.|$|E
25|$|It {{was while}} he was there that Eileen went into {{hospital}} for a hysterectomy and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the 1945 general election at the beginning of July. Animal Farm: A Fairy Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.|$|E

Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike for a <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that could force Syria to retaliate. However, Israeli columnist Caroline Glick wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} invasion {{is like a}} leafy tree {{which prevents}} us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore {{in order to be}} able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. I prefer the term 'revolutionary song'.|$|E
25|$|In his 20s, Palahniuk {{attended}} the University of Oregon School of Journalism, graduating in 1986. While attending college, {{he worked as}} an intern for National Public Radio member station KLCC in Eugene, Oregon. He moved to Portland, Oregon soon after. He wrote for the local newspaper for a short <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> began working for Freightliner as a diesel mechanic, continuing until his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote manuals on fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job to {{which he did not}} return until after he became a successful novelist. After casually attending a seminar held by an organization called Landmark Education, Palahniuk quit his job as a journalist in 1988. He performed volunteer work for a homeless shelter and volunteered at a hospice as an escort, providing transportation for terminally ill people and bringing them to support group meetings. He ceased volunteering upon the death of a patient to whom he had grown attached.|$|E

500|$|Courtship {{begins with}} the {{dominant}} male approaching the female, who then assumes a low-head posture and urinates. Unresponsive females run away on being pursued by a male.

On mounting, the males tries to clasp her flanks tightly. If she stands firmly, {{it is a sign}} that she is ready to mate. Copulation is marked by a single ejaculation, after which both animals stand motionless or a <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> resume grazing.|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little {{doubt in my mind that}} the world was headed for grief".|$|E

The video starts off with band playing; while they play, Chris Martin, who is sitting in a corner, gets up and joins them in the song. During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to them for a <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returns to sing the rest of the song.
