The effect, then, of {{the sudden}} enthusiasm for {{classical}} literature, which gained strength during every hour of the fifteenth century, was, as far as respected architecture, {{to do away with}} the entire system of Gothic science. The pointed arch, the shadowy vault, the clustered shaft, the heaven-pointing spire, were all swept away; and no structure was any longer permitted but that of the plain cross-beam from pillar to pillar, over the round arch, with square or circular shafts, and a low-gabled roof and pediment: two elements of noble form, which had fortunately existed in Rome, were, however, for that reason, still permitted; the cupola, and, internally, the <b>waggon</b> <b>vault.</b>|$|E

Vol. I., he will find that I carefully extended my definition of a roof so as to include more than is usually understood by the term. It was there {{said to be the}} covering of a space, narrow or wide. It does not in the least signify, with respect to the real nature of the covering, whether the space protected be two feet wide, or ten; though in the one case we call the protection an arch, in the other a vault or roof. But the real point to be considered is, the manner in which this protection stands, and not whether it is narrow or broad. We call the vaulting of a bridge [...] "an arch," [...] because it is narrow with respect to the river it crosses; but if it were built above us on the ground, we should call it a <b>waggon</b> <b>vault,</b> because then we should feel the breadth of it. The real question {{is the nature of the}} curve, not the extent of space over which it is carried: and this is more the case with respect to Gothic than to any other architecture; for, in the greater number of instances, the form of the roof is entirely dependent on the ribs; the domical shells being constructed in all kinds of inclinations, quite undeterminable by the eye, and all that is definite in their character being fixed by the curves of the ribs.|$|E
60|$|The {{custom of}} decorating the arch soffit with {{panelling}} is a Roman {{application of the}} Greek roof ornament, which, whatever its intrinsic merit (compare Chap. XXIX. ยง IV.), may rationally be applied to <b>waggon</b> <b>vaults,</b> as of St. Peter's, and to arch soffits under which one walks. But the Renaissance architects had not wit enough to reflect that people usually do not walk through windows.|$|R

Whether of timber or stone, roofs are necessarily divided into surfaces, and ribs or beams;--surfaces, flat or carved; ribs, traversing these in the directions where main strength is required; or beams, filling the hollow of the dark gable with the intricate roof-tree, or supporting the flat ceiling. Wherever the ribs and beams are simply and unaffectedly arranged, there is no difficulty about decoration; the beams may be carved, the ribs moulded, and the eye is satisfied at once; but when the vaulting is unribbed, as in plain <b>waggon</b> <b>vaults</b> and much excellent early Gothic, or when the ceiling is flat, it becomes a difficult question how far their services may receive ornamentation independent of their structure. I have never myself seen a flat ceiling satisfactorily decorated, except by painting: there is much good and fanciful panelling in old English domestic architecture, but it always is in some degree meaningless and mean. The flat ceilings of Venice, as in the Scuola di San Rocco and Ducal Palace, have in their vast panellings some of the noblest paintings (on stretched canvas) which the world possesses: {{and this is all}} very well for the ceiling; but one would rather have the painting in a better place, especially when the rain soaks through its canvas, as I have seen it doing through many a noble Tintoret. On the whole, flat ceilings are as much to be avoided as possible; and, when necessary, perhaps a panelled ornamentation with rich colored patterns is the most satisfying, and loses least of valuable labor. But I leave the question to the reader's thought, being myself exceedingly undecided respecting it: except only touching one point--that a blank ceiling is not to be redeemed by a decorated ventilator.|$|R
