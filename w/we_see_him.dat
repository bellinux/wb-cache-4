5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E

Typically, <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>him</b> quietly {{standing in front of}} a reluctant witness, and then <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>him</b> quiet again but with the witness in blood and the room devastated.

25|$|Upon recovering, {{he becomes}} a shell of his former self, {{remaining}} emotionally scarred and haunted by the promise he made to Annie in 1973, to return and save her from the fire-fight on the train. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> back in the clinical, bureaucratic, modern world of policing. After alienating his cold, unsympathetic colleagues and confiding to his elderly mother, he commits suicide by joyfully taking a running jump off the police station roof.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 467 {{he was one of}} the comites who {{accompanied}} the new emperor of the West, Anthemius, to Italy with a large army. In 468 <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> with the title of patrician which was given to him by Anthemius. Some explaining needs to be said here, since at this time Ricimer still held magister utriusque militum and patrician according to the fasti, and it appears Atheminus wished for Marcellinus to have the similar power held by Ricimer in order to be a counterbalance to him. In the East, it was established practice for both magistri militum praesentales to be equal but in the West it had become common for one magister, (usually the magister peditum), to be superior over the other and so this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the eastern structure and rule like an eastern emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as his second commander.|$|E
25|$|As a general, Chares {{has been}} charged with rashness, {{especially}} in the needless exposure of his own person; this said he appears to have been, during the greater portion of his career, the best commander that Athens had. In politics, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> connected throughout with Demosthenes. Morally he must have been an incubus on any party to which he attached himself, notwithstanding the assistance he might sometimes render it through the orators whom he is said to have kept constantly in pay. His alleged profligacy, which was measureless, he unblushingly avowed and gloried in, openly ridiculing the austere Phocion. His bad faith passed into a proverb; and his rapacity was extraordinary, even amidst the system then prevailing, when the citizens of Athens would neither fight their own battles nor pay the men who fought them, and her commanders had to support their mercenaries as best they could. His triumphal career under the banners of the republic may be seen as a symptom of the decline of Athens' values and power.|$|E

500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|Carabott {{felt that}} Phil Morris did well as John Jones/Martian Manhunter but lacked a proper introduction, stating:"Phil Morris does a respectable job of portraying John Jones {{in the few}} scenes <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in. He lacks the screen {{presence}} of someone like Carl Lumbly, who voiced the character on Justice League, but Morris holds his own and delivers the lines in that strong, straight forward tone that is signature Manhunter." [...] Alan Blair, editor of Airlock Alpha, felt that Smallvilles approach to Black Canary succeeded where the television series Birds of Prey failed. First, Smallville dropped the idea of [...] "meta-humans", which Blair believed is what doomed Birds of Prey, managed to make Black Canary look more like her comic book counterpart, and also give her Canary Cry [...] "some level of credibility". Carabott acknowledged that Smallville created a [...] "fairly good depiction" [...] of Black Canary, but disagreed with certain aesthetical choices. First, Carabott did not appreciate the removal of Black Canary's long, blonde hair, or the addition of make-up around the eyes that gave the character the look of [...] "Pris from Blade Runner". Carabott stated that Huffman's acting came off as [...] "a little over-the-top at times", but overall he {{felt that she was}} the right choice for Smallville.|$|E
2500|$|Yves Lebrac, (first {{presented}} with the name Yvon Lebrac), an in-house cartoonist, is comparatively laid-back.

[...] Although mostly on good terms with Gaston (unlike Prunelle), he occasionally loses his temper when deadlines loom and Gaston's interference becomes too much. When not a victim of [...] "gaffes", he is a lenient comrade of Gaston, and the character with which Franquin himself most identified.|$|E

2500|$|Director Gareth Edwards {{has said}} that he [...] "intentionally placed humans in shots to give the scene a sense of scale, as {{everyone}} knows the size of a human, so we know the size of a creature or a building." [...] He has also claimed that [...] "We said that we wouldn't place a camera anywhere {{it would be impossible to}} get one. We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I shake my head at when watching other people's films. Especially when [...] is first seen, we wanted a build up, and then pan up, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and then we don't see him. I love that." ...|$|E

As a final farewell, he places a mural-sized [...] "DICK"tation on the roof closest to the school entrance, and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> walking away with his friends for the last time, insulting a driver as he crosses the road and then further agitating that driver by breakdancing with Leon in the road.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are we doing to the children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013, the Eagles {{released}} a career-spanning documentary called History of the Eagles {{and began the}} supporting tour with 11 US arena dates from July 6 to 25.

We're gonna break it down to the fundamentals and then take it up to where it is now." [...] Original Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon also appeared on the tour. Walsh stated, [...] "Bernie’s brilliant, I never really got a chance to play with him, but we've been in contact. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> from time to time, and I'm really glad he's coming because it's going to take the show up a notch, and I'm really looking forward to playing with him, finally." [...] Former members Randy Meisner and Don Felder did not appear. Meisner had been invited but could not participate for health reasons, while Felder was never asked. Though his lawsuits against the Eagles were settled in 2007, Henley claimed that Felder continued to [...] "engage in legal action, of one kind or another" [...] against the band, but did not state what actions those are.|$|E
2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for termination of contract, at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because he had been there since day one. He added, [...] " [...] carry a lot of history. Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> making a determined effort to put his family back together. Whatever happens he'll always carry a torch for Kathy". According to Holden at that time, Pete was [...] "an untouchable", not in danger of being killed-off.|$|E

2500|$|Even the show's more {{hardened}} characters maintain ties to family. In {{the second}} season, Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further {{explained in a}} flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that [...] "La familia es todo" [...] ("Family is everything"). Gustavo Fring's franchise Los Pollos Hermanos translates to [...] "The Chicken Brothers." [...] This refers {{to the fact that}} the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family. In the first part of the fifth season, it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he's warned the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says [...] "don't skimp on family," [...] and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. Later, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think she abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, she seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia's daughter is important to how [...] "Lydia justified what she did to herself." ...|$|E
