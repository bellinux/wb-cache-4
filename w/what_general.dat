500|$|Harrison's {{health was}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; it was presented by the Whigs as robust, and by Democrats as decrepit. The campaign released a letter from his doctor, testifying to his good health; this was a presidential election first. Another testament to Harrison's health was his speeches: he gave 24 addresses between June and October, all in Ohio and lasting up to three hours; Van Buren did not give any. Harrison {{did not have the}} campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren that the President should [...] "go out among the voters as I intended doing". Democrats tried to paint Johnson as the true hero of the Battle of the Thames, but the Vice President refused to criticize Harrison's conduct in battle. Nevertheless, Johnson spoke with such enthusiasm that he may have set off a riot in Cleveland, and was followed onto the trail late in the campaign by John Tyler, who had difficulty staying on message and resorted to telling questioners, [...] "I am in favor of <b>what</b> <b>General</b> Harrison and Mr. Clay are in favor of." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith, {{concerned}} {{about the safety of}} his men, sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1,000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord. This ridge ended near Meriam's Corner, a crossroads about a mile (2km) outside the village of Concord, where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream. To cross the narrow bridge, the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast. [...] Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point, and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars. The British were now witnessing once again <b>what</b> <b>General</b> Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in the dark of night: the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston. [...] As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge, the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen, who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range. [...] The colonists returned fire, this time with deadly effect. Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded, with no colonial casualties. Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{generation}} Honda Ridgeline ended production in mid-2014. [...] According to Auto Trader, the automaker planned to continue production {{until the second}} generation Ridgeline was introduced; however, [...] "slow sales of the truck have prompted the automaker to pull it sooner than expected." [...] Despite this, the Ridgeline was one of Honda's more profitable vehicles due to the company's frugal nature {{that allowed them to}} develop the Ridgeline for under $250 million U.S. dollars —half of <b>what</b> <b>General</b> Motors would normally pay—, maximizing Honda's profit margin.|$|E
2500|$|The brigade of Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson was {{the first}} to cross the Chaplin River, climb the bluffs on the west bank, and began its attack around 2 p.m. Two of the brigade's regiments had been detached, leaving only three for the attack. Cheatham shouted, [...] "Give 'em hell, boys!" [...] One of the {{enduring}} legends of the Civil War is that Gen. Polk, who was also an Episcopal bishop, was nearby and seconded the cheer: [...] "Give it to 'em boys; give 'em <b>what</b> <b>General</b> Cheatham says!" [...] The brigade found that instead of striking the open flank it had expected, it was performing a frontal assault on the center of the Union position. The 16th Tennessee Infantry, under Col. John H. Savage, raced ahead of the other two regiments, attempting to reach the artillery battery of Capt. Samuel J. Harris. (Savage held Donelson in disdain, considering him a drunkard with limited military ability, and often paid little attention to orders from his commander. He considered Donelson's order to attack Harris's battery to be a death sentence against him.) As it moved west into a depression, it came under crossfire from the 33rd Ohio Infantry and the eight guns of Parsons' artillery on Open Knob, [...] to the north. Cheatham ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. George E. Maney forward to deal with Parsons on the Open Knob, but Donelson's brigade could not withstand the fire and withdrew to its starting point at 2:30p.m. with about 20% casualties; Savage's regiment lost 219 of its 370 men.|$|E
