Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child.

Torres scored his first goal in the Champions League for the season after deflecting Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov's clearance into goal, as Chelsea needed a 94th-minute winner from Victor Moses to secure a 3–2 victory on 7 November 2012. On 21 November 2012, Roberto Di Matteo was replaced as Chelsea manager by Rafael Benítez, who had previously coached Torres at Liverpool.

5|$|Although its {{ultimate}} aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> defeat the communist {{forces in the}} Soviet Union, the Corps was used almost exclusively to fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest operational unit. The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger émigrés and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian émigrés living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its command language was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained {{good relations with the}} Nedić administration.|$|E

In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989. The reunion <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him with his medical costs, but it was also something that was very important to Shero on a personal level, as it was a return to the organization he had the most success with. On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E

5|$|In Prague, the {{emergence}} of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the Royal Landstheater fortunes. Mahler's task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated {{for the rest of}} his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven's Ninth for the first time in his life. By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch almost began at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre's new production of Wagner's Ring cycle. Nikisch's illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except Götterdämmerung), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, win him popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.|$|E
5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E

5|$|Kristins Hall is {{an arena}} located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. It consist of an ice rink, a {{combined}} handball and floorball court, and a curling rink. The venue, {{owned and operated}} by the Lillehammer Municipality, opened in 1988 and cost 65 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to build. One of the motivations for its construction <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Lillehammer's bid to be selected as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The ice rink has a capacity for 3,194 spectators and is the home rink of GET-ligaen hockey club Lillehammer IK. Kristins Hall is located next to the larger Håkons Hall, which opened in 1993. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Kristins Hall was a training rink, and subsequently hosted the ice sledge hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. The venue also co-hosted Group B of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E
5|$|NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) began {{preparations}} {{for a military}} defence of Western Europe by incorporating most West European nations into a defence pact against alleged Soviet aggression in April 1951. This led to the militarisation of West Germany in 1955 and was met with the militarisation of East Germany soon after and its merger into the Warsaw Pact alliance with the Soviet Union. The purpose of Coastal Command <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> bolster the defence and guard against a potential Soviet naval threat in Atlantic and European waters. For Coastal Command the main concern was the Atlantic. On 1 March 1950 it had lost the photo reconnaissance units to RAF Bomber Command.
