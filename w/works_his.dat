5|$|A polystylist, Shostakovich {{developed}} a hybrid voice, combining {{a variety of}} different musical techniques into his <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the grotesque, and ambivalent tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style pioneered by Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the late Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came {{to be seen as a}} preeminent authority for the school.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, the {{government}} lifted the licensing {{restrictions on the}} number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Of Messager's non-operatic <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville, written {{jointly with}} Fauré, has been {{recorded}} by Harmonia Mundi, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe (1989). Messager's other collaboration with Fauré, the Wagner send-up Souvenirs de Bayreuth, {{has been recorded}} by several piano duettists, including Kathryn Stott and Martin Roscoe (1995, Hyperion), and Patrick de Hooge and Pierre-Alain Volondat (2000, Naxos). A suite from Les deux pigeons has been recorded several times, and in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score, with the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge.|$|E
5|$|Of Stanford's other orchestral <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> six Irish Rhapsodies all {{date from}} the 20th century, the first from 1901 and the last {{from the year before}} his death. Two of the set feature solo {{instruments}} along with the orchestra: the third (cello) and the sixth (violin). In Dibble's view some of the concertante works such as the First Piano Concerto (1894) and the Violin Concerto (1899) are in their orchestration and their lyricism as much in the tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford's music is often compared.|$|E

5|$|Once Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} in 1865, Rubinstein's brother Nikolai offered him {{the post of}} Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance {{of one of his}} <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> Characteristic Dances, conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled, Dances of the Hay Maidens, in his opera The Voyevoda).|$|E

Selfe's cousin Edward Muggeridge grew up in the same town but moved to the United States in 1855, restyled himself Eadweard Muybridge, and achieved global fame as a pioneer in the new field of photography.|$|E

5|$|Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, {{which he}} entered {{before he was}} six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his {{occasional}} long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually {{all of which are}} for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op.35) and all the minor keys (Op.39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|In 1843 he {{travelled}} to Italy {{where he}} remained for four years. On {{his return to}} London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded. In 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, {{he was one of the}} most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|The Life of Samuel Johnson or Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his <b>works.</b> <b>His</b> biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E
5|$|While Dredd <b>works</b> <b>his</b> {{way towards}} Ma-Ma, she {{calls in the}} corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd {{encounters}} Chan and is suspicious {{that he does not}} ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan's mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition, and is shot by Lex in the abdomen. Lex moves in to execute Dredd, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.|$|E
