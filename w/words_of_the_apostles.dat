Now, {{exactly in}} {{proportion}} as the Christian religion became less vital, {{and as the}} various corruptions which time and Satan brought into it were able to manifest themselves, the person and offices of Christ were less dwelt upon, and the virtues of Christians more. The Life of the Believer became in some degree separated from the Life of Christ; and his virtue, {{instead of being a}} stream flowing forth from the throne of God, and descending upon the earth, began to be regarded by him as a pyramid upon earth, which he had to build up, step by step, that from the top of it he might reach the Heavens. It was not possible to measure the waves of the water of life, but it was perfectly possible to measure the bricks of the Tower of Babel; and gradually, as the thoughts of men were withdrawn from their Redeemer, and fixed upon themselves, the virtues began to be squared, and counted, and classified, and put into separate heaps of firsts and seconds; some things being virtuous cardinally, and other things virtuous only north-north-west. It is very curious to put in close juxtaposition the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> and of some of the writers of the fifteenth century touching sanctification. For instance, hear first St. Paul to the Thessalonians: [...] "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it." [...] And then the following part of a prayer which I translate from a MS. of the fifteenth century: [...] "May He (the Holy Spirit) govern the five Senses of my body; may He cause me to embrace the Seven Works of Mercy, and firmly to believe and observe the Twelve Articles of the Faith and the Ten Commandments of the Law, and defend me from the Seven Mortal Sins, even to the end." ...|$|E

Jude then asks the reader to recall how even after the Lord saved his own people out of the land of Egypt, he did not hesitate to destroy those who fell into unbelief, much as he punished the angels who fell from their original exalted status and Sodom and Gomorrah. He describes in vivid terms the apostates of his day. He exhorts believers to remember the words spoken by the Apostles, using language similar to the second epistle of Peter to answer concerns that the Lord seemed to tarry, How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts..., and to keep themselves in God's love, before delivering a doxology.|$|E

40|$|MARRIAGE AND CELIBACY IN CHRIST ACCORDING TO 1 CORINTHIANS 7. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} {{is to show}} the light which in Jesus Christ newly {{illuminated}} two forms <b>of</b> human life: <b>the</b> married life and the celibacy. Thanks to <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian understanding <b>of</b> marriage and celibacy, as they are described in the New Testament, with <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> these forms <b>of</b> life in <b>the</b> Hellenistic world and in Judaism it gets to a differentiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accents typical for the period from those that are essentially Christian. A special emphasis is put on <b>the</b> seventh chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Letter to the Corinthians. By putting <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> this chapter about marriage and celibacy into <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole Scripture and tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, the thesis pursues another goal - i. e. a Catholic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apostle.</b> <b>The</b> chapter in question was many times in history explained as a glorification <b>of</b> virginity, while <b>the</b> interpreters often ignored <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> this one-handed accent on <b>the</b> self-confidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian married couples. <b>The</b> second aim <b>of</b> this thesis {{is to find a}} conciliatory interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apostle</b> even for <b>the</b> married couples, so that <b>the</b> maximalism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian endeavour for sanctity is preserved.

These were for Christ, in opposition to Paul, Apollos, and Cephas, and any other ministers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> They were for Christ without his ministers; they were wiser than their teachers; they were above being under any ministrations and ordinances; as the others attributed too much to <b>the</b> ministers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel, these detracted too much from them, and denied them to be of any use and service.

There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male or female, for all are one in Christ. For so many who are committed to following Jesus in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> love and being a church that lives that love, this decision will bring real pain.

Perfectionism: A Personal Testimony: 1 I was eighteen years of age when I began to entertain serious doubts as to my actually having attained so high a standard of Christian living as I had professed, and [which both the ministry with which I was associated] and other Holiness movements advocated as the only real Christianity.

60|$|Ans. Sir, you mistake me, I treat {{not here}} {{of our being}} baptized with the Spirit, with respect to its coming from heaven into us; but of that act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit, when come, which baptizeth us into a body or church. It {{is one thing to}} be baptized with the Spirit in the first sense; and another to be baptized by it in the sense I treat of: for the Spirit to come upon me, is one thing; and for that when come, to implant, embody, or baptize me into <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> Christ, is another. Your {{question}} therefore is grounded on a mistake, both of my judgment, and <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apostle.</b> Wherefore thus I soon put an end to your objections. For the Spirit to come down upon me, is one thing; and for the Spirit to baptize, or implant me into the church, is another: for to be possessed with the spirit, is one thing; and to be led by that spirit, is another. I conclude then; seeing the argument taken from that one baptism, respecteth church fellowship properly; and seeing water baptism meddleth not with it as such; it is the other, even that in 1 Corinthians 12:16 that is here intended, and no other.|$|R
60|$|And as I {{have said}} {{concerning}} ministers, so I say {{to all the}} brethren, Carry it so, that all the world may see, that indeed you are <b>the</b> sons <b>of</b> love. Love your Saviour; yea, show one to another that you love him, not only by a seeming love of affection, but with <b>the</b> love <b>of</b> duty. Practical love is best.38 Many love Christ with nothing but <b>the</b> lick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue. Alas! Christ Jesus the Lord must not be put off thus; 'He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,' saith he, 'he it is that loveth me' (John 14:21). Practical love, which stands in self-denial, in charity to my neighbour, and a patient enduring of affliction for his name; this is counted love. Right love to Christ is that which carries in it a provoking argument to others <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brethren (Heb 10:24). Should a man ask me how he should know that he loveth <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> God? <b>the</b> best answer I could give him, would be in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apostle</b> John; 'By this,' saith he, 'we know that we love <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> God, when we love God, and keep his commandments' (1 John 5:2). Love to God and Christ is then shown, when we are tender of his name; and then we show ourselves tender of his name, when we are afraid to break any, <b>the</b> least <b>of</b> his commandments. And when we are here, then do we show our love to our brother also.|$|R

[...] And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lifted up to heaven, <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> books in his hand, and <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> truth writ on his lips, it is to show thee that his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men. And whereas thou seest the world is cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over his head; that is to show thee that, slighting and despising the things that are in the world, for the love that he hath to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to have glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have showed thee this picture first, because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place whither thou art going hath chosen to be thy guide, in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in thy way; wherefore take good heed to what I have showed thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.|$|R
