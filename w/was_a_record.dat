5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Atlantic Canada, the storm {{produced}} very high waves, flooding a ship near Sable Island and stranding another ship.

In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30mm), and 20,000 people in Pictou County were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68mph (110km/h) near St. Lawrence. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in Grand Falls-Windsor due to slick roads.

He oversaw a $1.32billion total budget, 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E
