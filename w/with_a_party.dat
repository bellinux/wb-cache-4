5|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> from his brigade. The fort commander’s response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E

40|$|Employees in {{the role}} of {{outsider}} can be faced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dispute between colleagues. Taking sides is a crucially important, yet neglected tactic in handling disputes. In a study of 226 Chinese employees, we investigated the influence of employees&# 39; moral and expedient orientations on their siding intentions in a workplace dispute characterized by different distributions of legitimacy, negative sanctions and guanxi. Results indicate that legitimacy information leads moral-oriented employees to side <b>with</b> <b>a</b> legitimacy <b>party</b> whereas sanction information leads expedient-oriented employees to side <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sanction <b>party.</b> However, the Chinese employees also take guanxiinto account. Guanxias contrasting information decreased both {{the extent to which the}} strong-moral, weak-expedient-oriented Chinese employees sided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> legitimacy <b>party,</b> and the extent to which weak-moral, strong-expedient-oriented employees sided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sanction <b>party.</b> Implications of these results for developing a universal theory of siding are discussed...|$|R

When the natives were ready to depart, the Keates took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act of throwing his spear.

It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair.

5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
