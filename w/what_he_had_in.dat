5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{prospect}} of bowing out on a high, Redhage revealed in July 2016 that he never seriously contemplated retirement following the 2015–16 season and always intended to push on into 2016/17. And so it was on 16 August 2016, Redhage re-signed with the Wildcats for the 2016–17 NBL season. In his 12th season as a Wildcat, Redhage took an even further reduced role than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 2015/16. With the NBL's move to allow team's to have three imports and carry an 11-man roster in 2016/17, Redhage's playing time quickly dropped to under 10 minutes per game.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years later}} Turner's team {{eliminated}} Blackburn Rovers, {{who at the}} time lay second in the First Division, in the fifth round of the FA Cup. They thus became the first Fourth Division side to reach the sixth round. In 1964–65, he led them to promotion from the Fourth Division, and three years later to the championship of the Third. By this time the young players who had been the mainstay of Oxford's rise through the divisions were ageing or retired. Turner had no money to strengthen the side for its Second Division campaign, and struggled with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had.</b> <b>In</b> April 1969, he became General Manager of the club, leaving the running of the team to Ron Saunders, and in February 1972 he was dismissed when the club admitted they were unable to afford to keep him in post.|$|E

500|$|For a decade, Johnson's {{constant}} {{work on the}} Dictionary disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had {{to employ}} a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy, and kept hundreds of books around. John Hawkins described the scene: [...] "The books he {{used for this purpose}} were <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning."

To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer, William Strahan.|$|E

Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because [...] "any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people." [...] Therefore, instead of trying {{to solve the problem of}} creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: [...] " [...] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures." [...] In an interview with SquareGo, Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game's development process.|$|E

2500|$|Kodansha (publisher of the Tsubasa and xxxHolic manga) {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} developing both films and contacted Production I.G, who chose Toru Kawaguchi and Tetsuya Nakatake as producers. Since Tsubasa was popular in Japan and Production I.G was well-known, Natakate wanted viewers to enjoy the film. Directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and written by Midori Goto and Junichi Fujisaku, its characters were designed by Yoko Kikuchi and its music composed by Yuki Kajiura. Director Itsuro Kawasaki met producer Nakatake, who told him that they were working in The Princess of the Birdcage Kingdom but had not chosen a director. According to Kawasaki, he had declined an offer from Production I.G because {{he was working on}} an anime television series. It was the director's first feature animated film; Kawasaki was initially sceptical about making a film based on Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, because he thought the market was saturated and wanted to focus on less-popular series. Since he had heard that Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was an entertaining manga, Kawasaki read it when the film finished development. He was satisfied because it was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind when he made the film, and praised Clamp's illustrations and designs. When Yoko Kikuchi was chosen as character designer, Kawasaki said, [...] "we were very lucky"; he was familiar with Kikuchi's work, and she was fond of the character Sakura.|$|E
