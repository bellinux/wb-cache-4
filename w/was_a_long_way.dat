5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.|$|E
25|$|Having {{been knocked}} out of the FP Trophy, the team turned to the Twenty20 Cup. Making only his fourth {{appearance}} in the tournament since 2005, Cook smashed 80 off 56 balls in a vain effort against Kent that was rained off. While his England partner Bopara shone against Sussex, Cook only scored one but made up for this with a 60 run partnership with Bopara days later to put Essex top of the table. Despite averaging 49 from these four games, Cook felt he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from the international squad. In his last performance before joining with the Ashes squad, Cook scored a 57 ball century, carrying his bat through the innings as they crushed Surrey but without Cook and Bopara, the team were knocked out after two successive losses.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Brighton was a {{small town}} based on a declining fishing {{industry}} and still suffering the effects of damage caused by the Great Storm of 1703. Its population {{in the middle of}} the century was approximately 2,000. Its fortunes improved after a doctor from nearby Lewes, Richard Russell, wrote a treatise encouraging the use of seawater as a cure for illness, in particular glandular swellings. He recommended bathing in the sea and drinking the water at Brighton. This form of medical therapy became popular, and helped make the town a fashionable place to visit. Brighton became increasingly popular throughout the rest of the century, but received its next significant boost when the Prince Regent, son of King George III, made his first visit in 1783. By 1786 he had a home in the town—a rented farmhouse near the Old Steine, inland from the coast—and he later commissioned the architect John Nash to build a palace, the Royal Pavilion, for him on the site. The Prince was an infrequent churchgoer, and Brighton's only Anglican church, St Nicholas, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from his home and up a steep hill. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of visitors and residents caused overcrowding in the church. In 1789 the new Vicar of Brighton, Revd Thomas Hudson, decided to resolve these problems by building a new chapel near the Prince's house. He hoped to encourage the Prince to attend, and thereby worship more often than he had in the past, and considered that a more central chapel would relieve the pressure on the parish church.|$|E

It was the only population centre in Bernwood Forest, a forest owned by English monarchs as a hunting ground. Traditionally believed to have been the home of King Lud, Brill Palace was a seat of the Mercian kings, the home of Edward the Confessor, and an occasional residence of the monarchs of England until at least the reign of HenryIII (1216–1272). Although a centre for manufacture of pottery and bricks, Brill <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from major roads or rivers, and separated by hills from Oxford.

500|$|In 2014, Samuel Sánchez (then BMC) had {{attacked}} {{at the foot}} of the Cauberg on behalf of his teammate Philippe Gilbert, whose subsequent attack allowed him to take the race victory. BMC attempted to replicate this strategy with an attack from Ben Hermans in the same place as Sánchez's. Gilbert's attack, however, was less successful than his 2014 effort: although most riders were dropped, Michael Matthews was able to hold his wheel. Michał Kwiatkowski was chasing alone at this point. Valverde bridged across to Gilbert and Matthews, with another 15 riders joining the group shortly afterwards. Kwiatkowski <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> behind with [...] remaining, but was able to stay in the slipstream of the other riders and recover from the climb. He then began a long sprint and was able to keep the rest of the group behind him. Valverde finished second, with Matthews third. Kwiatkowski's win was his first win in the rainbow jersey of the world champion.|$|E
500|$|On 1 July, Marshall and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, {{surveyed}} {{sites in}} the Knoxville area {{with representatives of the}} TVA and Stone & Webster, the designated construction contractor. No perfectly suitable site was found, and Marshall even ordered another survey of the Spokane, Washington area. At the time, the proposed nuclear reactor, gas centrifuge and gaseous diffusion technologies were still in the research stage, and the design of the plant <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> off. The schedules, which called for construction work on the nuclear reactor to commence by 1 October 1942, the electromagnetic plant by 1 November, the centrifugal plant by 1 January 1943 and the gaseous diffusion plant by 1 March, were unrealistic. While work could not commence on the plants, a start could be made on the housing and administrative buildings. Stone & Webster therefore drew up a detailed report on the most promising site, about [...] west of Knoxville. Stephane Groueff later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Sinclair's {{first home}} {{computer}} was the MK14, which {{was launched in}} kit form in June 1978. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from being a mass-market product. Its very name – MK standing for [...] "Microcomputer Kit" [...] – was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists. It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be {{hooked up to a}} UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard. Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10–15,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.|$|E

500|$|Fighting in the South West Pacific Area in late 1943 {{and early}} 1944 was {{dominated}} by General Douglas MacArthur's Operation Cartwheel, a series of operations directed at isolating and neutralising Rabaul, the main base of the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area. MacArthur's original Elkton III plan called for Australian troops to capture first Lae, then Finschhafen, and finally Madang {{with a combination of}} airborne and amphibious assaults. However, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from Finschhafen to Madang—. Thinking in terms of a shore-to-shore operation, which would be limited in radius of action to the distance that landing craft could sail in one night, the Commander of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey recommended in August 1943 that an intermediate objective be seized first. Saidor was chosen as it had accessible beaches, a harbour, and a pre-war airstrip, and it was allocated the codename [...] "Michaelmas" [...] by MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ). It was recognised that the capture of Saidor might make that of Madang unnecessary, as both could cover the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits, and both would provide airbases close to the Japanese base at Wewak. For the time being though, both were considered objectives.|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
500|$|The squad was solidly {{better in}} the stage 1 team time trial {{than they had been}} in the {{equivalent}} stages at the Italian and French Grand Tours, coming in 12th of the 22 teams. The result installed Antón 24 seconds back of defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, whose [...] squad finished second. Antón had a bad ride on the Vuelta's first day in the mountains, in stage 4. On a blisteringly hot day, Antón lost contact with the main group of overall favorites {{on the way to the}} summit finish at Sierra Nevada, losing a minute and a half to the stage winner and more than a minute to the race's top favorites. Antón admitted that he did not have the form of 2010, when he crashed out of the race while holding the overall lead. He said that even on the flat third stage he had come close to losing time to the peloton, and that while there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> left to race, he effectively ruled himself out of overall contention. Nieve, on the other hand, had finished with the race's top riders, and lay 14th overall at this point. Antón and Nieve both rode well on stage 8 to San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Joaquim Rodríguez claimed the stage win atop a climb featuring 27% gradients in places, while Antón took sixth 15 seconds back and Nieve 13th a further five seconds back. Both finished well back on stage 9, with Nieve ceding 41 seconds to the day's winner and Antón close to two minutes. Both were all but conclusively ruled out of any overall contention in the stage 10 individual time trial, losing between three and five minutes to the race's top overall riders after their earlier time losses. Txurruka found a winning breakaway in stage 11, but finished well back in seventh place, as David Moncoutié took a dominant solo win.|$|E
