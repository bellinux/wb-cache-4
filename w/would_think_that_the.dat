[...] "A reasonable person in the shark fin business would be aware of the SFPA's application to the KD IIs activities." ...|$|E

Only two weeks before, Kennedy had spoken in a more conciliatory tone, speaking of [...] "improving relations with the Soviet Union": in response to Kennedy's Berlin speech, Nikita Khrushchev, days later, remarked that [...] "one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speeches were made by two different Presidents." ...|$|E

60|$|You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> {{colors of}} the design are thus {{represented}} by separate pieces of glass, put in one after the other, {{the result would be}} a sort of mottled appearance, or at least <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gradations of hue would be sharp and harsh in their effect.

The pieces are so small, and the different shades succeed each other so regularly, that when viewed from the ordinary distance, the junctions disappear altogether, and the shades mingle and blend together in the softest and most perfect manner.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, at {{the surface}} plasmon {{resonance}} for a silver nanoparticle, the scattering cross-section is about 10x the cross-section of the nanoparticle.

This is true, however, when compared with the size of the nanoparticle, the ratio (...) is reduced. Particles with a large scattering cross section tend to have a broader plasmon resonance range.|$|R
60|$|It {{was thus}} that first I became acquainted with Senor Andres de Fonseca, my benefactor, the strangest man whom I have ever known.

Madame d'Angeville told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this, by ropes tied under her arms, by the guides.
