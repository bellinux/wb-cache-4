50|$|Often, {{reactive}} intermediates such as carbocations {{and free}} radicals have more delocalized structure than their parent reactants, {{giving rise to}} unexpected products. The classical example is allylic rearrangement. When 1 mole of HCl adds to 1 mole of 1,3-butadiene, {{in addition to the}} ordinarily expected product 3-chloro-1-butene, we also find 1-chloro-2-butene. Isotope labelling experiments have shown that <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> is that the additional double bond shifts from 1,2 position to 2,3 position in some of the product. This and other evidence (such as NMR in superacid solutions) shows that the intermediate carbocation must have a highly delocalized structure, different from its mostly classical (delocalization exists but is small) parent molecule. This cation (an allylic cation) can be represented using resonance, as shown above.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In his {{review in the}} New York Times, Vincent Canby noted, [...] "There {{are a number of}} hefty laughs scattered throughout [...] [...] [...] this woozy film adaptation" [...] and added, [...] "Noises Off is a practically perfect stage piece, constructed with such delicacy that any opportunistic adjustment can destroy it, which is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> [...] [...] [...] It may not even be Mr. Bogdanovich's fault. He hasn't opened up the play in any foolish way. There are even times when the camera successfully catches the tempo of the lunatic action without being overwhelmed by it. Yet too often the action and the dialogue are so fuzzily understood that the laughs are lost. The film's problem is more basic: the attempt to Americanize a fine English farce about provincial seediness. It can't be done." ...|$|E

5000|$|IGN {{awarded the}} game {{a score of}} 4.9 out of 10, with a final {{assessment}} of [...] "Bad". They felt that the game didn't feel like a Star Trek game, arguing that [...] "it feels much closer to playing a videogame about radio-controlled cars, only with a Star Trek skin. Sure, Encounters has phasers, sensors and photon torpedoes, and they even sound and look like their TV counterparts, but combat is less than riveting," [...] and [...] "Encounters suffers from a dire lack of Star Trek. There's very little point in using the Star Trek license without exploiting its greatest assets. Unfortunately, that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here.</b> Take away the name and there's little here that resembles the long-running franchise at all. And while playing through different eras of the Trek timeline is a great concept, and definitely has its appeal, the actual gameplay doesn't do it justice. It's a bargain title, but even gamers strapped for cash need to know Encounters is Star Trek only in name, not in function." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "there is no date, with {{possible}} exceptions of Motion and Lone-Lee, that can touch this live duet setting for breaking new ground. Given his apprenticeship with Lennie Tristano, Konitz {{is well known}} for his melodic improvising and his ability to re-conceptualize a tune. But <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here,</b> with Martial Solal's dramatic, often theatrical style of piano playing, is the extension of Konitz's own abilities to visualize inherently what is possible within a given framework ... It's quite honestly the finest live recording of Lee Konitz that exists". On All About Jazz C. Michael Bailey noted [...] "What Solal gave Konitz on this recording was freedom, a mental and creative elasticity that the saxophonist could use as a springboard for improvisation beyond the normal harmonic coloring within-the- lines. This music is perfect for the probing jazz enthusiast who cannot make sense of late Coltrane or fellow saxophonist Eric Dolphy. There is enough of the melody retained to see where the artists are going and appreciate them for it".|$|E

[...] VanDerWerff did note that [...] "At every level of Ray Donovan, it’s evident that talented people are working on the show", and praised Schreiber's performance as Donovan, writing [...] "The strongest reason to watch the show is the cast, which is stocked to the gills with great actors. That starts with Ray himself, Liev Schreiber, who’s long been among the most mesmerizing thing onscreen in any of his films and repeats that performance here, in a role that has enough confidence in its leading man to let him be silent often."

The long-form interview became Wolf’s trademark, which news reporter Joan Crosby summarized for the Oakland Tribune: “I've viewed several of her documentaries One, an interview with Jerry Lewis, is a powerful piece of film which will never be shown because it dealt with a film he was producing and directing from his own script and which was never completed because money ran out. It's rare to see an interview with a star which leaves the viewer in tears, but that's <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> as Lewis himself is seen crying and totally vulnerable.

But then Annett's very humanity is the essence that permits her to gently and deeply probe her subjects until they strip away the professional facade and reveal the human beneath.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} day in Iraq, at a {{ceremony}} at one of Saddam Hussein's former residences at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, a number of U.S. dignitaries spoke in a ceremony for television cameras, avoiding overtones of the triumphalism present in U.S. announcements made earlier in the war. Vice President Joe Biden expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that [...] "they expect a government that reflects {{the results of the}} votes they cast". Gen. Ray Odierno stated that the new era [...] "in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq".

When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that [...] "It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> in the long run". He noted the Iraq War [...] "will always be clouded by how it began" [...] regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, [...] "This {{is one of the reasons}} that this war remains so controversial at home".On {{the same day}} Gen.

5000|$|This {{is exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> and it explains, why {{the end of}} this section {{finishes}} in the diatonic genus unlike the exegesis of Mega Ison by Petros Peloponnesios, and it continues with the echos varys, the tonality of the new section. The beginning of this section emphasizes the tetraphonic melos of the diatonic echos varys, its characteristic is the tritone above the finalis within the tritos pentachord F, and the word [...] "τετράφωνος" [...] has the cadence formula of ἦχος βαρύς. At the sign epegerma (ἐπέγερμα, Νο. 55) is already the end of the varys section. Concerning the medial signature at this kolon the manuscripts do not agree. In the Papadike Ottoboniano greco Ms. 317 (fol. 7r) of the Vatican Library (see example) it is the signature of echos tritos (ἦχος τρίτος) on F which opens the lower ambitus of the tritos octave on B flat. The critical edition of Maria Alexandru continues {{to the beginning of the}} following section on G as plagios tetartos (ἦχος πλάγιος τοῦ τετάρτου), while the version indicated in blue follows the version of Vaticana greca Ms. 791, here the sign epegerma turns the phthongos on G into a tritos (already at the cadence marked by an apoderma) and prepares a plagios tetartos cadence according to the melos of phthora nana (νεἅγιε νανὰ) at the following kolon. Petros Peloponnesios follows here another great sign stavros (σταυρός) which can be only find in a few manuscripts, but it mediates between the different versions by preparing the section of plagios tetartos with an additional tetartos cadence on the phthongos G.|$|E
