The state of light to medium hypnosis, where the body undergoes physical and mental relaxation, is associated with a pattern mostly of alpha waves [...] However, what these results indicate is unclear. They may indicate that suggestions genuinely produce changes in perception or experience that are not simply a result of imagination. However, in normal circumstances without hypnosis, the brain regions associated <b>with</b> <b>motion</b> <b>detection</b> are activated both when motion is seen and when motion is imagined, without any changes in the subjects' perception or experience. This may therefore indicate that highly suggestible hypnotic subjects are simply activating to a greater extent the areas of the brain used in imagination, without real perceptual changes. It is, however, premature to claim that hypnosis and meditation are mediated by similar brain systems and neural mechanisms.|$|E

Using the motion model to estimate the second frame from the first frame, for example, should give a very low prediction error in the corresponding region. To relax the need for accurate motion models, it is proposed to examine the convergence of the prediction error, rather than the prediction error itself. In an iterative process of motion computation followed by computing the prediction error, those points for which the prediction error is being reduced are considered as a coherent region.

Processing of image {{data collected from}} both surveillance camera and on road traffic control motor vehicle camera {{is a big issue}} because often the objects are in motion and sometimes both the objects and camera are not steady. This leads to Blurring of the image and further image processing is not possible due to the degradation of received image. So Image Deblurring techniques are applied before enhancement or further processing.

The method presented here gives the above information along <b>with</b> the <b>motion</b> information. The information about <b>motion</b> <b>detection</b> is very important because in the Deblurring process the noise estimation cannot be done without knowing actual pixels of the sensor noise present in the image.
