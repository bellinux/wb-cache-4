Widely hailed as [...] "the holy mother of Lingnan", she was a skilled military leader among 6th century Baiyue peoples. She helped the Sui Empire contain the mutiny of various Baiyue tribes and start the sinicization of the region, indirectly helping Lingnan evolve into her current form.

40|$|The {{story of}} Chica da Silva, a <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figure</b> in Brazil's popular culture, is examined, {{contrasting}} existing public records with myths {{about her life}} in Tijuco, the small town that became the world's center of diamond explotation in the XVIII century. Through her union with the King of Portugal's overseer of diamond extraction, this former slave gained access {{to a life of}} luxury and power far beyond that of other women of similar origins. Chica built a stable family, participated in religious organizations in her community, learned to write, and even supported artistic activities; while both written sources and many oral traditions depict her cruelty and promiscuity, these are contradicted by evidence of her social acceptance by the white elite and slaves alike. Myths can be best understood as diffuse but pervasive mechanisms of social control. Chica's trajectory remains a significant example of the power of individuals who believe in their own worth and ability to affect social change by altering expected patterns of superior/subordinate relationships...|$|E

40|$|Federico da Montefeltro (1422 – 1482), the Duke of Urbino, was a <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figure</b> {{during the}} Italian Renaissance. He {{is the subject}} of a famous {{painting}} by Piero della Francesca (1416 – 1492), which displays the Duke from the left and highlights his oddly shaped nose. The Duke is known to have lost his right eye due to an injury sustained during a jousting tournament, which is why the painting portrays him from the left. Some historians teach that the Duke subsequently underwent nasal surgery to remove tissue from the bridge of his nose in order to expand his visual field in an attempt to compensate for the lost eye. In theory, removal of a piece of the nose may have expanded the nasal visual field, especially the “eye motion visual field” that encompasses eye movements. In addition, removing part of the nose may have reduced some of the effects of ocular parallax. Finally, shifting of the visual egocenter may have occurred, although this seems likely unrelated to the proposed nasal surgery. Whether or not the Duke actually underwent the surgery cannot be proven, but it seems unlikely that this would have substantially improved his visual function...|$|E

The Inscription no. II also establishes that king Kharaosta was also the original owner and the silver vessel was later inherited by Apraca dynasty.

Although early accounts are substantiated by more recent case reports in scientific literature, we suspect that the phenomenon is not only used as a literary means in fiction, {{with the aim of}} dramatizing, but probably also in historical accounts. For this purpose, we examine the case history of Henry III of Navarre who allegedly turned white on the evening of the Saint Bartholomew’s day massacre, and challenge this claim, due to inconsistencies in his biography, with the current pathophysiological understanding of canities subita...|$|R
50|$|A {{survey of}} art {{preferences}} {{in many different}} nations found that realistic painting was preferred. Favorite features were water, trees {{as well as other}} plants, humans (in particular beautiful women, children, and <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures),</b> and animals (in particular both wild and domestic large animals). Blue, followed by green, was the favorite color. Using the survey, the study authors constructed a painting showing the preferences of each nation. Despite the many different cultures, the paintings all showed a strong similarity to landscape calendar art. The authors argued that this similarity was in fact due to the influence of the Western calendar industry. Another explanation is that these features are those evolutionary psychology predicts should be popular for evolutionary reasons.|$|R

50|$|Mediterranean powers {{frequently}} sentenced convicted {{criminals to}} {{row in the}} war-galleys of the state (initially only in time of war). After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 and Camisard rebellion, the French Crown filled its galleys with French Huguenots, Protestants condemned for resisting the state. Galley-slaves {{lived and worked in}} such harsh conditions that many did not survive their terms of sentence, even if they survived shipwreck and slaughter or torture at the hands of enemies or of pirates. Naval forces often turned 'infidel' prisoners-of-war into galley-slaves. Several <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> served time as galley slaves after being captured by the enemy—the Ottoman corsair and admiral Turgut Reis and the Knights Hospitaller Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette among them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nature of}} prosopographical {{research}} has developed over time. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an 'older' form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well-known social elites, {{many of whom}} were already <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures.</b> Their genealogies were well-researched, and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a 'power elite' to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of Charles A. Beard and Sir Lewis Namier. Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Sir Lewis Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th century British House of Commons, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone lightly termed [...] "Namier Inc." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{genre of}} [...] "tales and stories" [...] is {{probably}} the least represented genre from surviving literature of the Middle Kingdom and Middle Egyptian. In Late Egyptian literature, [...] "tales and stories" [...] comprise the majority of surviving literary works dated from the Ramesside Period of the New Kingdom into the Late Period. Major narrative works from the Middle Kingdom include the Tale of the Court of King Cheops, King Neferkare and General Sasenet, The Eloquent Peasant, Story of Sinuhe, and Tale of the shipwrecked sailor. The New Kingdom corpus of tales includes the Quarrel of Apepi and Seqenenre, Taking of Joppa, Tale of the doomed prince, Tale of Two Brothers, and the Report of Wenamun. Stories from the 1st millennium BC written in Demotic include {{the story of the}} Famine Stela (set in the Old Kingdom, although written during the Ptolemaic dynasty) and short story cycles of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods that transform <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> such as Khaemweset (Nineteenth Dynasty) and Inaros (First Persian Period) into fictional, legendary heroes. This is contrasted with many stories written in Late Egyptian, whose authors frequently chose divinities as protagonists and mythological places as settings.|$|R

This book translates that experience into an insider’s tour {{of some of the}} most interesting moments in American history. Grove’s stories are populated with <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> such as John Brown, Charles Lindbergh, Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea—as well as the not-so-famous. Have you heard of Mary Pickersgill, seamstress of the Star-Spangled Banner flag? Grove also has something to say about a few of our cherished myths, for instance, the lore surrounding Betsy Ross and Eli Whitney. Grove takes readers to historic sites such as Harpers Ferry, Fort McHenry, the Ulm Pishkun buffalo jump, and the Lemhi Pass on the Lewis and Clark Trail and traverses time and space from eighteenth-century Williamsburg to the twenty-first-century Kennedy Space Center. En route from Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic to Cape Disappointment on the Pacific, we learn about planting a cotton patch on the National Mall, riding a high wheel bicycle, flying the transcontinental airmail route, and harnessing a mule.

25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color of his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to <b>well-known</b> <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|R
