5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E

Later, on Pranab Mukherjee's request, Tharoor and Krishna moved out of the hotels.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{made its}} Olympic debut at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2006–07 season, Arsenal {{transferred}} Fabrice Muamba to Birmingham City {{and released}} Mart Poom, who subsequently joined Watford on a free transfer. Jérémie Aliadière moved to Middlesbrough in a £2million deal while club captain and record goalscorer Thierry Henry left to join Barcelona for a reported fee of £16million. Henry commented that his decision to leave Arsenal <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> departure of chairman David Dein and the uncertainty over Wenger's future. Midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg and striker José Antonio Reyes departed the club in July 2007, moving to West Ham United and Atlético Madrid respectively. Other players, Arturo Lupoli, Ryan Garry and Joe O'Cearuill, left on free transfers. Defender Matthew Connolly, who joined Colchester United on loan for a six-month period, later signed for Queens Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water {{in order to make the}} colours match.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized {{the choice of the}} actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} {{of the events that}} {{led to the creation of}} the new archdiocese appear in the form of an exchange of letters in 798 between Coenwulf and Pope Leo III. Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jaenberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of the kingdom of Mercia. The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan, as each had his own reasons for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa. Coenwulf's desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent, where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn. Coenwulf would have wished to retain control over the archiepiscopal seat, and at the time he wrote to the pope Kent was independent of Mercia.|$|E
