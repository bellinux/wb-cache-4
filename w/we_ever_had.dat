25|$|The last {{period was}} really victorious for NAER MATARON. We {{composed}} the harshest and most extreme music <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> for our new album. So {{the next big}} step was taken, as we are now proud to announce our signing to Season of Mist. We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and feel that we are also supported henceforth in the same spirit. To this point, we wish to extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist for giving us the chance to deliver {{what will be the}} most extreme and uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date.|$|E

A 1995 Warner Bros. Press release refers to the orchestra as [...] "30-piece", while an article of the New York Times reads that the orchestra was a much smaller [...] "20-piece". In an interview for [...] "The Cartoon Music Book", Animaniacs composer Richard Stone said that the number of people in the orchestra varied, depending on the episode and the type of music needed, but said that [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> more than thirty-two [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Electric Mud sold 150,000 copies {{within the}} first six weeks of release. Peaking at number 127 on Billboard magazine's Billboard 200 album chart, it was Muddy Waters' first album {{to appear on the}} Billboard and Cash Box charts. In a Rolling Stone feature, Pete Welding wrote, [...] "'Electric Mud' does great disservice to one of the blues' most {{important}} innovators, and prostitutes the contemporary styles to which his pioneering efforts have led." [...] Although American critics panned the album, it was better received in England. According to Marshall Chess, [...] "It was the biggest Muddy Waters record <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> at Chess, and it dropped instantly. The English accepted it; they are more eccentric." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Araya {{said that}} [...] "when we did Divine Intervention, {{this was the}} last conference <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> with a record label where they sat us down and sold us the idea of how they wanted to do [...] "Divine", and how {{they were going to do}} this with the cover... and all these {{different}} ideas for the album. Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of Mirror Ball, the members of Pearl Jam (minus Vedder) and producer O'Brien (on keyboards) joined Young in August 1995 for an eleven-date tour in Europe to promote the album. When the band toured, fans referred to them as [...] "Neil Jam". Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "It was a dream come true. We got to play a bunch of Neil Young songs with Neil Young himself and {{got to go to}} Berlin, to Jerusalem, to the Red Sea." [...] This tour proved very successful with Young's manager Elliot Roberts calling it [...] "one of the greatest tours <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in our whole lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Don Trip {{grew up in}} the low-income East Memphis. Living in a fatherless household, Trip {{watched as}} his mother worked 3 jobs, and still {{struggled}} to support him along with his brother and sister. At the age of 12, he began working to provide for his siblings, saying that [...] "all <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> was us." [...] Even at an early age, though, Don Trip was inspired by Jay-Z and Tupac, and even studied Jadakiss verses with an almost religious fervor. At 15, he noticed his family was falling apart, and felt the urge to do something more to help them. Inspired by the pre-teen duo of Kriss Kross, he began rapping and making music.|$|E
2500|$|Litmanen {{spent seven}} years in Amsterdam, winning four Dutch championships and three KNVB Cups, and scored a total of 129 goals, 91 {{of them in the}} league. He is the club's top scorer in European {{competition}} with 26 goals in 54 matches (including two goals scored in the 2002–03 season). Litmanen has the honour of being one of just three players presented in a special video featurette at the Ajax Museum. The other two are Marco van Basten and Johan Cruyff. Frank Rijkaard, Litmanen's teammate in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, once said, [...] "Dennis Bergkamp was brilliant for Ajax but the best No.10 <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> was Jari." [...] In his time at Ajax, some fans called him [...] "Merlin" [...] because of the magic he brought to the pitch.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{returned}} to the UK from the United States in August 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour {{at the time of}} the UK's Punk rock explosion. The band's 1977 album Whatever Happened to Slade proved a commercial failure while their tour that spring had shown that they could no longer fill large venues. Slade's waning success soon led to the band taking any gig they could. They found themselves playing small venues, mainly universities and clubs. The band's tours often ran at a loss, with the band having to bring their own PA and lightshow. Bassist Jim Lea however was unphazed. [...] "I still thought the band was great," [...] he told Chris Charlesworth in 1983, [...] "We were playing as well if not better than <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had...</b> now we had something to prove again." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacKay {{began the}} 1929–30 {{season with the}} Bruins, but chose to retire mid-season, {{although}} he continued as the team's business manager {{until the end of}} the year. He was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the top players of his time. Lester Patrick praised his abilities: [...] "He was perhaps the greatest centre <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> on the coast. MacKay was a great crowd pleaser. He was clean, splendidly courageous, a happy player with a stylish way of going. He was one of those who helped make pro hockey a great game." [...] His greatest limitation was his size, standing five foot nine and around 155 pounds; he frequently battled through injuries and missed many games throughout his career as a result. His nickname, [...] "the wee Scot", was in reference to his diminutive size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after a while, we did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".|$|E
