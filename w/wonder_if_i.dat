500|$|From Oxford, David {{moved to}} the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, London, the {{following}} year. She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel was her first cookery book.

500|$|In {{modern times}} Mrs. Beeton's {{practice}} has been criticised as plagiarism; Beeton's modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her [...] "lifting" [...] and [...] "brazenly copying" [...] recipes from others, {{and says that}} this was [...] "the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ...". The New York Times said, [...] "Isabella [...] plagiarised only the best". [...] This led to the comment that [...] "Mrs Beeton couldn't cook but she could copy". Hughes recounts that Beeton's [...] "first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs" [...] and that her work was [...] "brazenly copied... almost word for word, from books {{as far back as}} the Restoration". The influential 20th-century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as [...] "a plagiarist" [...] and later wrote: [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from".|$|E

500|$|Critics noted {{references}} and similarities to 1980s pop music throughout the album. Adrien Begrand from PopMatters found the hook of [...] "Sweet Music" [...] {{similar to those}} in songs by Prince and INXS. [...] "Still Standing" [...] was described by Helen Pidd from The Guardian as [...] "a magnificent blend of Prince's [...] "Kiss" [...] and Peter Gabriel's [...] "Sledgehammer"". [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] contains a reference to British band Dead or Alive's 1985 song [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)", in the line [...] "You got me spinning round, round, round, round like a record". The title of [...] "I Feel For You" [...] {{is the same as the}} 1979/1984 song by Prince and Chaka Khan, although it is not a cover of the song. [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] directly refers to urban contemporary band Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's 1984 song [...] "I <b>Wonder</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Take You Home", both in its title and refrain. The line of the song in which Minogue sings [...] "don't confuse emotions with the pleasure principle" [...] also refers to American recording artist Janet Jackson's 1987 song [...] "The Pleasure Principle".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

2500|$|At dawn [...] {{set out to}} find , the Horned Monster. [...] He came to a broad plain at {{the foot}} of the mountains, and saw [...] lying at rest. It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While , Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, [...] came up to him. [...] "I wonder what you are doing here," [...] he said. [...] "There is someone here I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?" [...] asked Gopher.

[...] And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. [...] You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart." [...] , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. [...] "Raise your right leg," [...] said Gopher. [...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening. [...] He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into [...] [...] The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. [...] tore at the earth around the tunnel. [...] Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. [...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "I am looking at ," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> need fear him." [...] "I will go over there and see if he is dead," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E
