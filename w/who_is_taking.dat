500|$|Joe {{has become}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned by {{his life in the}} city, and worries about his former patients in his home town. [...] He learns that Jennie is having an affair with Lansdale. [...] As Joe sits, head in hands, his late mother and a chorus of the friends he left behind appeal to him to return ("Come Home"). [...] Joe has been offered the position of physician-in-chief at the Chicago hospital, replacing Denby, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> an executive position, or as the elder doctor terms it, being [...] "kicked upstairs". [...] At a dedication of a new pavilion at the hospital, Joe has a revelation and shifts the path of his life; as he does so, Grandma appears and calls for Marjorie to come watch, an echo of the scene in which he learned to walk. [...] Joe refuses the position, and will return to his small town to assist his father, accompanied by Emily and Charlie, but not by Jennie (Finale: [...] "One Foot, Other Foot" [...] (reprise)).|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Washington & Jefferson, Cruikshank {{enrolled}} at the Princeton Theological Seminary.

[...] In December 1915, he was rumored to be the successor to Bob Folwell as the head football coach at Washington & Jefferson. [...] A newspaper account at the time noted:"Cruikshank, as a coach, {{ought to be a}} real success. He knows football and, best of all, he knows how to handle men. [...] He {{was one of the most}} popular students that ever attended W. & J. and his great work on the gridiron won him the honor of All-American center on many of the mythical elevens of 1914.

2500|$|Under the Laws, it {{is illegal}} to play an {{opponent}} without the ball, except in a scrum, ruck or maul; referees usually interpret this as authorising the common practice of [...] "clearing out the ruck", that is, physically removing an opponent <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> part in the ruck, and rarely penalise the practice if it happens within close proximity to the ruck. The Laws also prohibit dangerous tackles, though they make no specific mention of the [...] "spear tackle". In the light of such video footage as was available to him at the time, the laws, and referee reports, the citing commissioner concluded that there was no case for Mealamu and Umaga to answer: [...] he did not, of course, have available to him the full footage (which only emerged later), or the benefit of the IRB's subsequent ruling on proper interpretation of the laws. In September 2005, in response to a request for clarification from O'Driscoll's home union, the Irish Rugby Football Union, the IRB's Laws Committee ruled that the act of lifting a player off his feet in a tackle and dropping him {{in such a way that}} his head or upper torso hits the ground first is a dangerous tackle; they further ruled that such an act constitutes dangerous play no matter where it occurs in the game.|$|E
