2500|$|On July 7, 2008, McCain {{criticized the}} {{traditional}} pay-as-you-go financing of Social Security, saying: [...] "Americans {{have got to}} understand that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that's a disgrace." [...] The next day, he reiterated that Social Security uses current workers' tax payments to fund current retirees' benefits, and he said, [...] "That’s why it’s broken, that’s why we can fix it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{suggested}} that some black anti-Semitism {{arose from the}} tensions of landlord-tenant relations: [...] When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working in Chicago, we had numerous rent strikes on the West Side, and it was unfortunately true that, in most instances, the persons we had to conduct these strikes against <b>were</b> Jewish landlords... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> living in a slum apartment owned by a Jew {{and a number of}} others, and we had to have a rent strike. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> $94 for four run-down, shabby rooms, and .... we discovered that whites ... <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> only $78 a month. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> 20 percent tax.The Negro ends up paying a color tax, and this has happened in instances where Negroes actually confronted Jews as the landlord or the storekeeper. The irrational statements that have been made are the result of these confrontations.|$|R
5000|$|Former PBA Commissioner Mark Gerberich, {{who presided}} over the PBA in the 1990s, summed up the decline in ABC viewership and related {{licensing}} contracts, stating, [...] "In 1991, we got $200,000 a show which went into the prize funds. A year later, we got $50,000. In 1997, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> $150,000 to stay on TV." ...|$|R

50|$|Dwellable {{was started}} by Adam Doppelt in {{reaction}} to a Hawaiian vacation rental experience that was, according to Doppelt, “Not exactly the dream vacation <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> for.” With a background on the information and recommendation side of mobile apps and websites from Urbanspoon, he created Dwellable {{as a tool to}} search, reserve, and review vacation rentals. Dwellable is co-founded by software developer Nathan Kriege and CEO Kirby Winfield.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's very possible," [...] one of {{the others}} agreed. [...] "A two-per-cent {{dividend}} is disappointing and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> this by cutting down the reserve fund.

60|$|The next Sunday placed us {{on board}} the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's screw-steamer Austria (Capitano Rossol). As usual, the {{commander}} and officers did all they could to make their voyagers comfortable; the Company did the contrary. At this spring season, true, the migratory host of unfeathered bipeds crowds northwards; even as in autumn it accompanies the birds southwards. But when berths are full, passengers should be refused; and if the commercial director prefers dead to live goods, travellers should be duly warned. The accommodation would have been tolerable in a second-class or third-class English steamer, which charges fifteen shillings to a sovereign per diem; here, however, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> between £2 and £3.|$|R

"You know," [...] {{she went}} on, opening her clear gray {{eyes on the}} consul, with a {{characteristic}} flash of shrewd good sense through her quaint humor, [...] "we never reckoned where this thing would land us, and <b>we</b> found <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> a hundred pounds, {{not only for the}} Desboroughs, but all the people they'd MARRIED, and their CHILDREN, and children's children, {{and there were a lot}} of outsiders we'd never heard of, nor wanted to hear of.

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you my impressions, sir," [...] the latter continued. [...] "The ignorance {{displayed}} in the German newspapers about England is entirely a matter of censorship. Their actual information as regards every detail of our military condition is simply amazing. They know exactly what munitions are reaching our shores from abroad, they know how <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> for them, they know exactly our financial condition, they know all about our new guns, they know just how many men we could send over to France to-morrow and how many we could get through in three months' time. They know the private views of {{every one of the}} Cabinet Ministers. They knew in Berlin yesterday what took place at the Cabinet Council the day before.

60|$|It {{must not}} be {{imagined}} that such an endowment would be a new payment, by the community. In all probability we are already paying as much, or more, to authors, {{in the form of}} royalties, of serial fees, and the like. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> now with an unjust unevenness--we starve the new and deep and overpay the trite and obvious. Moreover, the community would have something in exchange for its money; it would have the copyright of the works written. It may be suggested that by a very simple device a large proportion of these payments could be recovered. Suppose that all books, whether copyright or not, and all periodicals sold above a certain price--sixpence, let us say--had to bear a defaced stamp of--for example--a halfpenny for each shilling of price. This would probably yield a revenue almost sufficient to cover these literary pensions. In addition the books of the pensioned authors might bear an additional stamp as the equivalent of the present royalty.|$|E

5000|$|Vocalist Simon Le Bon commented [...] "We {{went into}} a barn in Sussex and started jamming away, and before we got finished, it was like, 'Right we've got the album, let's go and record it now.' And I don't think we got it right; I don't think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> enough attention. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> quite {{self-conscious}} {{at the time as}} well, the way things had been going, and it kind of made us stand outside of ourselves to do the album. But out of that came two of the best songs Duran's ever come up with, 'Serious' and 'My Antarctica,' they're really, really beautiful songs. I don't think it's a bad album, but there's definitely weak spots on it, definitely. I mean, something like 'Violence of Summer,' it just didn't have a proper chorus, great verse though. Just not paying enough attention, we just lost our concentration." ...|$|R
