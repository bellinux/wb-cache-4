According to Păltânea: [...] "Mr. Henri Streitman reveals his very own manner [...] of searching for the truth through the most distant detours, those that run into surprises and open up grand perspectives." [...] Doctor Ygrec, the reviewer at Adevărul, found the book amusing overall, but objected to its [...] "commonplace" [...] jokes about God as an anthropomorphism deity.

2500|$|In November 2005 expert {{evidence}} was {{submitted to the}} High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations and who sought to bring a legal action to try to prove {{a link between the}} mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children. The evidence presented included reports detailing the higher rate of birth defects, and alleging that exposure to the toxic waste was the likely cause of the children's deformities. They also presented a report written by Roger Braithwaite, an environmental expert instructed by the families, which concluded that the negligent handling of the waste by Corby Borough Council demonstrated [...] "naivety, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and a possible serious conflict of interest... At this early stage it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these... badly polluted lands have never been effectively or comprehensively assessed, properly permitted, regulated, monitored or adequate records maintained... This is environmental negligence on a grand scale." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I beg pardon," [...] said John Harned; [...] "but it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a wise bull. He {{knows he}} must not fight man. See! He smells death there in the ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a wise decision," [...] he said, {{looking out}} of the window, and wholly absorbed in the contemplation of the evidences of misery and vice, [...] "with this poverty at the very doors of the church." ...|$|R
60|$|I ask myself--suppose {{you knew}} that by inflicting {{prolonged}} pain on 100 rabbits you could discover a way to the extirpation of leprosy, or consumption, or locomotor ataxy, or of suicidal melancholia among human beings, dare you refuse to inflict that pain? Now I am quite unable to say that I dare. That sort of daring <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be extreme moral cowardice, to involve gross inconsistency.|$|R
6000|$|... "All that I have seen," [...] Pierre replied gravely, [...] "and it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the riddle}} may easily be read, even by you {{who claim to}} have no {{knowledge}} of military matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If the Serpent {{and myself}} could swim {{into the river}} and bring off the other canoe," [...] the young sailor replied, [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> our safest course would be the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where did {{you pick}} him up?" [...] Saul asked impatiently. [...] "Why did you waste time on the scoundrel? It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> after all he has done it was your {{business}} to flog, rather than make friends with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not, for {{the sake}} of the blessed Virgin, let there be strife and bloodshed!" [...] said Eveline; [...] "rather unbind my eyes, and let <b>me</b> speak <b>to</b> those whose {{approach}} you dread. If friends, as it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I will be the means of peace between you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] {{said the}} Master, [...] "he payeth us. We advert the goods. Forthwith all men buy them. Then hath he more money. He payeth us again. We advert the goods more and still he payeth us. That <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> friend Nick, a mighty good busyness for us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after Lawrence's {{death in}} August 1958, John A. McCone, Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, wrote to President Eisenhower {{suggesting}} {{the establishment of}} a memorial award in Lawrence's name. President Eisenhower agreed, saying, [...] "Such an award <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be most fitting, both as a recognition of what he has given to our country and to mankind, and as a means of helping to carry forward his work through inspiring others to dedicate their lives and talents to scientific effort." [...] The first Lawrence Awards were given in 1960.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will submit them to Our Lord {{who sent}} me. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> He and His Church are one, {{and that there}} should be no {{difficulty}} about this matter." [...] Then she turned upon the judge and said, [...] "Why do you make a difficulty when there is no room for any?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Caroline," [...] and Marian {{was thrown into}} herself again; but she thought a little longer, and seeing that Caroline was still waiting and musing, she ventured on saying, in a timid voice, [...] "Somehow, I think, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the more affection there was, the more painful it would all be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why impossible?" [...] and for {{the first}} time since we had come upon Horry Sims did Pierre indulge in that indescribable shrug and wave of the hands which was {{peculiar}} to him. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> now is the time, if ever, when we can do somewhat for the Cause--when we can prove that although our company of Minute Boys numbers but three, we are of importance, and may make our names known to those who are staking their lives for the liberty of this country." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'd favor using ... the old {{expressions}} of the merry knights. Ods bodikins, Ods fish, gadzooks, etc., <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more acceptable {{than some of the}} slang we hear, and I don't know but that I had rather hear somebody mention having 'a merrie joust' than to hear some baseball player say that he had been 'beaned' by a 'fade-away.'" [...] (April 1915.) ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{regard to}} Knot V., I beg to express to VIS INERTIÆ and to any others who, like her, {{understood}} the condition {{to be that}} every marked picture must have three marks, my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase [...] "fill the columns with oughts and crosses" [...] should have caused them to waste {{so much time and}} trouble. I can only repeat that a literal interpretation of [...] "fill" [...] <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> require that every picture in the gallery should be marked. VIS INERTIÆ {{would have been in the}} First Class if she had sent in the solution she now offers.|$|R

60|$|Then we {{need not}} appeal to history, to the {{declarations}} of {{the framers of the}} government, but we know from judge Douglas himself that slavery began to be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far back as 1699, or one hundred and sixty years ago, or five generations of men,--counting thirty years to a generation. Now, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it might have occurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his attention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that thing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.|$|E
60|$|But {{the contest}} {{could not be}} abandoned; devil or reason, or {{whatever}} it was, must be overcome, else {{there was no hope}} for me; and such is the powerful effect of fixing all one's thoughts on one object, assisted no doubt by the reflex effect on the mind of prayer, that in due time I did succeed in making myself believe all I wished to believe, and had my reward, since after many days or weeks of mental misery there would come beautiful intervals of peace and of more than peace, a new and surprising experience, a state of exaltation, when it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was lifted or translated into a purely spiritual atmosphere and was in communion and one with the unseen world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did, sir. But, Mr. Newcome, {{on looking}} round at the {{quantity}} of lumber these men have made, and recollecting the distance they are from Albany, I am {{at a loss to}} imagine how they could hope to get their ill-gotten gains to market without discovery. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> their movements must be known, and that the active and honest agents of {{this part of the country}} would seize their rafts in the water-courses; thus making the very objects of the squatters' roguery the means of their punishment. Is it not extraordinary that theft, in a moral sense at least, can be systematically carried on, and that on so large a scale, with such entire impunity?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We may stop here, and die of {{asphyxiation}} {{when our}} atmosphere tanks are empty," [...] replied Perry, [...] "or we may continue {{on with the}} slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface. If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive. There <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than as though we sat supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did the rear-admiral send any message, Sir Wycherly?" [...] inquired Sir Gervaise; [...] "in {{his letter}} he <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> refer <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some verbal {{explanations}} from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 128. Would {{not that}} a good deal depend upon its being in a public thoroughfare? If it were in a thoroughfare, a great many persons might pass in who would be driven in by accident, or driven in by caprice, if they passed it; {{but if it were}} at a little {{distance}} from a thoroughfare, it would be less crowded with those persons who are not likely to derive much advantage from it?--Quite so; but there would always be an advantage in attracting a crowd; it would always extend its educational ability in its being crowded. But it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> all that is necessary for a noble Museum of the best art should be more or less removed, and that a collection, solely for the purpose of education, and for the purpose of interesting people who do not care much about art, should be provided in {{the very heart of the}} population, if possible, that pictures not of great value, but of sufficient value to interest the public, and of merit enough to form the basis of early education, and to give examples of all art, should be collected in the popular Gallery, but that all the precious things should be removed and put into the great Gallery, where they would be safest, irrespectively altogether of accessibility.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has never}} been an American {{tradition}} to speak truly of the people. Always we have thought of them wishfully, according to our own ends. A social evangelist, in a far-away temple, shouts loudly {{of the people and}} class solidarity. Are these Americans class conscious? I can only show them to you and say, judge for yourselves. ... It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> an unschooled man who is aware and puzzled is frequently more intelligent than a man with an educated mind, convinced and closed. But that's merely my judgment, so don't accept it. Accept only my people and judge for yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "No one {{has used}} the {{argument}} that statutory rape—at least according to the Blackstone sic law dictionary—was solely a crime that a man could commit. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it became a woman's crime when you had this political egalitarianism {{which has led to}} Washington state's having an equal-rights amendment, although it was rejected by the United States. That makes this a very political case. I was one of the leading opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment when I was in the Congress, if not the leading opponent." [...] - in response to the statutory rape charges against his daughter, Mary Kay Letourneau, for her extramarital affair with her 12-year-old student.|$|E
5000|$|But {{the strip}} doesn't assert that. That's the {{assumption}} that adults make because nobody else sees him, sees Hobbes, {{in the way that}} Calvin does. Some reporter was writing a story on imaginary friends and they asked me for a comment, and I didn’t do it because I really have absolutely no knowledge about imaginary friends. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> though, that when you make up a friend for yourself, you would have somebody to agree with you, not to argue with you. So Hobbes is more real than I suspect any kid would dream up.|$|R

Home I have not, unless the Prince's Towers can thus be called; country, since the sad event of this week, I feel as if I had altogether lost; of hopes, I have few in this world, with which your image has not been connected; but those which were once so precious <b>to</b> <b>me</b> are now, I fear, lost; you know I have no fortune, <b>to</b> tempt <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay, or you to follow; as for my life, I fear it will soon be very valueless--an sure it will be miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother," [...] said Armine, smiling {{back to her}} {{in spite}} of himself, [...] "I have not liked to say so, it seemed a shame; but staying at the Vicarage made me wonder at my being such an egregious ass last year! Do you know, I couldn't help it; but that good lady <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quite mawkish in her flattery! And how she does domineer over that poor brother of hers! Then the fuss she makes about details, never <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> know which are {{accessories}} and which are principles. I don't wonder that I was an absurdity {{in the eyes of}} all beholders. But it is very sad if it has really alienated my dear Infanta from all deeper and higher things!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Kenny Knight, {{who helped}} organise the 2002 meeting for David Duke and {{described}} as [...] "friendly" [...] with Scalise by Duke, stated that Scalise actually spoke to Knight's [...] "Jefferson Heights Civic Association" [...] {{in a room}} booked for the EURO meeting but before the meeting. The existence of the [...] "Jefferson Heights Civic Association" [...] was questioned in the Louisiana newspaper The Advocate which said [...] "Multiple people familiar with Jefferson Parish's myriad civic associations, including past presidents of the Civic League of East Jefferson, also have said {{over the past week}} that they had never heard of such a group" [...] and that [...] "the organization does not appear on the parish's list of neighborhood groups, an informal but lengthy resource on the parish's website." [...] Duke criticised the attacks on Scalise, stating that the name EURO sounded innocuous, saying also that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he would have realized that it was our group, because he knew Kenny. I mean, he knew me. But I can't swear to it.

500|$|Boyd {{has said}} that he prefers to believe the {{overdose}} was accidental. He recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a [...] "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} had just begun to regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be terrible." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{still she}} held out against the marriage. [...] "I told them it would be wicked," [...] she said. [...] "And when I went to Church, all the Psalms and {{everything}} {{said it would be}} wicked. Then Lisette said it was wicked to love a married man, and I said I didn't know, I couldn't help it, but it would be more wicked to vow I would love a man whom I hated, and should hate more every day of my life. Then they said I might have a civil marriage, and not vow anything at all, and I told them that <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> no better than not being married at all. Oh! I was very very miserable!" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{opposed the}} payment of the Veterans Bonus to World War I veterans. On April 26, 1932, during the {{hearings}} on Payment of Adjusted-Compensation Certificates before the House Committee on Ways and Means he testified: that the trust fund had already been nearly exhausted by the previous year’s act increasing the loan restriction on adjusted compensation accounts to 50%; that full payment now would cost the Government $1,600,000,000; and that in any case the accounts represented the only assets many veterans possessed, leaving nothing to families if the veteran should die. “We should {{make every possible effort}} to see that they get employment. There is no question about that. But whether we would be doing the veterans a real service by cashing in these certificates, even if we were in a position <b>to</b> do it, <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very doubtful.” ...|$|R
