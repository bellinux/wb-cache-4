In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Deacon, this {{occurred}} between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> first fossil evidence of stone tool {{use and the}} beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends. More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that [...] "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species." [...] This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the [...] "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus Homo.|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 2005 the BBC {{reported}} that Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's Human Spaceflight Development Department, stated that Kliper would be used: [...] "For future exploration, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> objective {{of going to}} the Moon, {{it is important to have}} several possibilities to go there, and within this framework of cooperation to have our own access to orbit around the Moon." [...] In the same context, Alain Fournier-Sicre, head of the ESA permanent mission in the Russian Federation, also stated that: [...] "The objective is to have a vehicle which is more comfortable than the Soyuz capsule which will be used with pilots and four passengers… [...] It is meant to service the space station and to go between Earth and an orbit around the Moon with six crew members." ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{closes the}} futile chapter of explanations. Fraud is a vera causa, but an {{hypothesis}} difficult of application {{when it is}} admitted that the effects could not be caused by ordinary mechanical means. Hallucination, through excitement, is a vera causa, but its remarkable uniformity, as described by witnesses from different lands and ages, knowing nothing of each other, makes us hesitate to accept a sweeping hypothesis of hallucination. The case for it is not confirmed, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same reports from witnesses certainly not excited.|$|E
