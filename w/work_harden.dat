40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a 12 -week <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> program designed for back injured workers. Study design: In this study, 32 subjects were recruited. Pre- and post-assessment results were used to measure the program effectiveness. The intensity of the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> program was based on the overloading training principle. Subjects were contacted by phone three months after the program completion for their work status.

Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks.

40|$|Shot peening is a {{mechanical}} surface treatment used {{for improving the}} mechanical behaviour of metallic materials and structural parts. Its most frequent use is related to fatigued components, but it is effective also to delay or prevent fretting, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} testing {{carried out to}} assess the wear and RCF performance of laser clad rail. Stronger and harder materials can be laser clad {{on top of the}} working surfaces of standard (e. g. 260 grade) rail in order to improve wear and RCF life. A twin-disc method has been used to assess the suitability of various candidate cladding materials. The materials were clad on top of 260 grade rail discs and were tested against a disc of standard wheel material. Wear was measured by weighing the discs before and after each test. An Ellotest B 1 differential eddy current crack detector was used to detect RCF cracks in the rail disc. Four clad materials were used namely, Hadfield, Stellite 6, Maraging and 316 Stainless Steels. In the tests carried out, wear was not always reduced with the cladding. It is assumed that these tests were not long enough for some of the materials to fully <b>work</b> <b>harden</b> and therefore wear rates would improve with a greater number of test cycles.
