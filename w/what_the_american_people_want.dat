The light {{projected}} upon her innocence by his tone {{was so strong that}} the girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: [...] "It's a pretty sight, the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted. Do you think property grows on you like a moustache? Well, it seems as if it had, on your father. If I owned the Reverberator I wouldn't be stumping round here; I'd give my attention to another branch of the business. That is I'd give my attention to all, but I wouldn't go round with the delivery-cart. Still, I'm going to capture the blamed thing, and I want you to help me," [...] the young man went on; [...] "that's just what I wanted to speak to you about. It's a big proposition as it stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the most universal society-paper the world has seen. That's where the future lies, and the man who sees it first is the man who'll make his pile. It's a field for enlightened enterprise that hasn't yet begun to be worked." [...] He continued, glowing as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing eyes half-closed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively. The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope. But it was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed it, a proof of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale. [...] "There are ten thousand things to do that haven't been done, and I'm going to do them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by the prominent members themselves--oh THEY can be fixed, you'll see!--from day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every breakfast-table in the United States: that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> and that's what the American people are going to have. I wouldn't say it to every one, but I don't mind telling you, that I consider my guess as good as the next man's on what's going to be required in future over there. I'm going for the inside view, the choice bits, the chronique intime, as they say here; what the people want's just what ain't told, and I'm going to tell it. Oh they're bound to have the plums! That's about played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign of 'private' and 'hands off' and 'no thoroughfare' and thinking you can keep the place to yourself. You ain't going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of general interest, and it ain't going to be right you should; it ain't {{going to continue to be}} possible to keep out anywhere the light of the Press. Now what I'm going to do is to set up the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place. We'll see who's private then, and whose hands are off, and who'll frustrate the People--the People THAT WANTS TO KNOW. That's a sign of the American people that they DO want to know, and it's the sign of George P. Flack," [...] the young man pursued with a rising spirit, [...] "that he's going to help them. But I'll make the touchy folks crowd in THEMSELVES with their information, and as I tell you, Miss Francie, it's a job in which you can give me a lovely lift." ...|$|E

On February 13, 2009, Dan Eggen and Ellen Nakashima of the Washington Post wrote that the compromise stimulus bill included a provision introduced by Kissell that would; “require the Transportation Security Administration to purchase uniforms manufactured in the United States; most TSA clothing is currently assembled in Mexico and Honduras from U.S.-made fabric.” [...] In March 2010, Kissell voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying, [...] "I kept my word." [...] In January 2011, Kissell voted against repealing the law. His vote angered some constituents in his district; the Washington Post noted that a year after his election, [...] "the euphoria {{has given way to}} second thoughts at best and outright rebellion at worst." [...] Michael Lawson, an African-American democratic leader from his constituency, stated the people believed they would receive one outcome and got another with his vote on health care. He explained the latter vote as follows: “let everybody vote, and then let's focus on the economy and get people back to work,because that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> us to do.” ...|$|E

Although it was useful to have all information acquired during the war, the media played a huge role in <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> saw and believed.

5000|$|I am {{outraged by}} the {{comments}} that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday... The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago. His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe {{that they do not}} portray accurately the perspective of the black church. They certainly don't portray accurately my values and beliefs. And if Reverend Wright thinks that that's political posturing, as he put it, then he doesn't know me very well. And based on his remarks yesterday, well, I may not know him as well as I thought either.... What became clear to me is that he was presenting a world view that contradicts who I am and what I stand for, and what I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing. Anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what I'm about knows that I am about trying to bridge gaps and I see the commonality in all people. ...After seeing Reverend Wright's performance, I felt as if there was a complete disregard for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems. ...Whatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed, as a consequence of this.|$|R

500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed and guess <b>what?</b> That's where <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|R
