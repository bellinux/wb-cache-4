25|$|There is {{a setting}} in each member's account {{allowing}} {{the user to}} censor songs with explicit lyrics. The censoring option applies exclusively to song versions from albums with a Parental Advisory label, as other songs with censored versions <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> version played. An example is the song Jet Airliner by the Steve Miller Band, which had one word censored for radio play. With explicit lyrics off, that version will play, because the album {{did not have a}} PA label.|$|E
25|$|Evolution {{does not}} attempt to explain {{the origin of life}} (covered instead by abiogenesis), but it does explain how the {{extremely}} simple early lifeforms evolved into the complex ecosystem that we see today. Based on the similarities between all present-day organisms, all life on Earth originated through common descent from a last universal ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. All individuals have hereditary material in the form of genes that are received from their parents, then passed on to any offspring. Among offspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes via random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes during sexual reproduction. The offspring differs from the parent in minor random ways. If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next generation <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances of reproductive success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being better adapted to their living conditions become more common in descendant populations. These differences accumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is responsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.|$|E

Strong drink, taken often enough and in sufficient quantity, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> effect, of course, but Battie, distinguishing between 'original' and 'consequential' madness [...] would allow only that excessive drinking could 'become a very common, tho' remoter cause of Madness.' Others differed: John Ball in his Modern Practice of Physic, 1760, lists 'anxiety of mind' and too much 'strong vinous or spirituous liquors' as 'antecedent causes' of madness. Smart's mania, however it manifested itself, and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer, did not stem from drunkenness; it was aggravated, however, by frequent recourse to the bottle. Ironically enough, as Mrs. Piozzi recognised, if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home, all might have been well for him.|$|E
