These changes began {{as far back}} as the mid- 1980 s and culminated with the 1996 welfare law that “ended <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it. ” These tax and welfare changes have sharply increased the employment of single mothers and cut welfare rolls. However, little is know about the effects of these policy changes on the material well-being of single mothers and their children. Studies of those leaving welfare have found that a substantial percentage have problems paying rent, purchasing enough food, and paying utility bills. Other studies found a decline in income among the worst-off single mothers after 1994 or 1995. The goal of this paper is to examine the material well-being of single mothers and their families before and after recent welfare and tax reforms. Using data from two nationally representative household surveys we examine the consumption patterns of single mothers and their families. We find that the material conditions of single mothers did not decline in recent years, either in absolute terms or relative to single childless women or married mothers. This pattern holds for the average single mother as well as for low-educated single mothers at both the 15 th and 25 th percentiles of the consumption distribution. In most cases, our evidence suggests that the material conditions of single mothers have improved slightly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: “Prioritizing in Health Care – A {{challenge}} of the Welfare State?” It is a common fact that all resources are restricted. Health welfare {{becomes more and more}} expensive, due to better medication, new technology and administration. There is a need for prioritizing, but who has the responsibility, and how should it be done? In this report, you will read about where the prioritizing takes place in Denmark in different levels, and how prioritizing through economical evaluations afflict the social differences in the welfare state. In Great Britain and Norway the solution have been to collect all the different parts of involved in prioritizing, in one national prioritizing-council. Not only due to economical reasons, but also because of democratic difficulties in relation to prioritizing without informing the citizens about how it is done, and who is doing it. We have performed interviews with a medical doctor and a health economist to help us answer our questions and to use their knowledge and experience in our analysis. We have concluded that the prioritizing could be threatening the social equality, and therefore also threatening the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>We</b> have also concluded {{that a lot of people}} see a national council not only as a good idea, but also as a solution to the problems involved with prioritizing as of today...|$|R

As president, Clinton was attracted to welfare expert and Harvard University Professor David Ellwood’s proposal on welfare reform and thus Clinton eventually appointed Ellwood to co-chair his welfare task force. Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system. He advocated providing assistance to families for a limited time, after which recipients {{would be required to}} earn wages from a regular job or a work opportunity program. Low wages would be supplemented by expanded tax credits, access to subsidized childcare and health insurance, and guaranteed child support.|$|E

40|$|Europe is {{witnessing}} general {{attempts at}} a reformulation of the post-war social contract which {{gave rise to}} the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it (with public higher education <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it). I argue here for a strong thesis according to which Europe is facing the simultaneous renegotiation of the postwar social contract concerning the welfare state and the accompanying renegotiation of a smaller-scale, by comparison, modern social pact between the university and the nation-state. The renegotiation of the (nation) state/ university pact is not clear outside of the context of the changing <b>welfare</b> state contract, <b>as</b> state-funded higher education formed one of the bedrocks of the European welfare system in its major forms, and state-funded higher education remains one of its foundations. I am following here Stephan Leibfried and colleagues who argue that “competitive pressure to lower tax rates undermines the state’s resources and has the potential to unleash financial crises that, in turn, trigger cuts in welfare spending” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 7). Consequently, what they term “the golden-age "onstellation” of the four components of the state (the territorial state, the constitutional state, the democratic welfare state and the interventionist state) is currently threatened: “different state functions are threatened {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, and subjected to pressures for internationalization of varying intensity” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 9). I argue here that higher education policies, and especially public funding for universities, are one of the dimensions of the “golden-age constellation” under renegotiations in Europe today: they come under the “interventionist state” and its functions in Leibfried’s formulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of a}} Basic Income Grant (BIG) has {{for long}} been an {{appealing}} alternative to the means-tested social security nets associated with the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. Proponents of BIG highlight as comparative advantages its unconditionality, its inclusiveness and its administrative simplicity. Moreover, as capital-intensive investment and demographic evolutions engender a decline in activity rates, social security nets that rely on labour as both a source of financing and a condition for entry seem more and more untenable. These latter systems have however for long been in place and have a firm historical embeddedness. Hence, the introduction of BIG requires a revolutionary momentum. South Africa {{has gone through a}} period of profound societal change over the last two decades. After decades of racial exclusion, post-apartheid opened the pursuit of a progressive social inclusionary politics. South Africa {{has been one of the}} few countries where social security expenditure has been steadily on the rise since the second half of the 1990 s. The ANC-government has opted to strengthen several targeted grants (pensions, child grant, etc.), leaving the searing unemployed active population uncovered. This article contends that the introduction of a modest BIG, alongside the pre-existing grant system is a feasible and promising option as it would have a considerable beneficial effect on poverty without entailing large costs. This position is shared among an impressive coalition of civil society organisations and political parties. The article inquires why the ANC, in these conditions, shuns away from the introduction of BIG. We conclude that, how ripe South Africa may be for BIG, the ANC-ideology pushes government to strengthen the workfare-approach, including employment programmes, over a radical overhaul of the social security system. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} global {{economic}} and financial crisis, the governments throughout Europe have been closing, concentrating, restructuring or privatizing some public services and, at the same time, the number of services available in electronic platforms (e. g., by Internet or telephone) has been increasing. Nowadays, the need for structural reform and territorial reorganization of many public services is well-known in European countries, {{as well as in}} Portugal. The nature and the scope of these reforms depend on several factors related not only to the forces of supply and demand, but also to the social and territorial context. Some countries have already made deeper changes. In September 2013, Netherlands proclaimed the end of the <b>Welfare</b> State (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it today in most European countries) and welcomed the beginning of a Participation Society. The public services in Portugal and European countries face many challenges, namely: the redefinition of the concept of public interest; the different roles of central and local government structures/new organizational paradigms; the orientation to the citizen's needs; the incorporation of technology and innovation; the financing systems and their sustainability; and the social and territorial (in) equalities. This communication is the result of PhD research in Geography and Regional Management, started at November 2012 and with a final report due in November 2015. To understand how the Portuguese public services will face the new challenges and trends, I'm doing a revision of state of the art about public services in Europe, their agents and dynamics. With this step, I'm summarizing the past practices and the actual problems, challenges and trends in the supply and demand of public services. I'm also analysing the Portuguese nineteen government programs (between 1974 and 2014), relating them with the administrative reforms and modernizations effectively performed in Portugal.

5000|$|The Institute {{was one of}} the key {{institutions}} that pressed for reform of the welfare system in the mid-1990s. Charles Murray, while an Institute fellow from 1981 to 1990, wrote his groundbreaking book Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980 (1984) argued that the welfare state had fostered a culture and cycle of dependency that was to the detriment of both welfare recipients and the United States as a whole. This launched a debate culminating in President Bill Clinton proposing to [...] "end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it" [...] and the passage of landmark federal welfare reform in 1996. More recently, marking the 20th anniversary of federal welfare reform, the Institute published a report by former senior fellow Scott Winship that evaluated the plight of the poor since 1996. He concluded that, contrary to popular opinion, reform was more successful than not, helping move many single mothers off the dole and into the workforce. Furthermore, he reported that children—in particular, those in single-mother families—were significantly less likely to be poor today than they were before welfare reform.|$|E
5000|$|It was not however {{until the}} 1980s that U.S. food banks began to enjoy rapid growth. A second {{response}} to the [...] "rediscovery" [...] of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact. In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice {{in the same way}} as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, president Reagan's administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. But in the decades that followed, food banks have become an accepted part of America's response to hunger. Demand for the services of US food bank increased further in the late 1990s, after the [...] "end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it" [...] with President Clinton's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In Canada, foodbanks underwent a period of rapid growth after the cutbacks in welfare that took place in the mid-1990s. As early as the 1980s, food banks had also begun to spread from the United States to the rest of the world. The first European food bank was founded in France during 1984. In the 1990s and early 2000s, food banks were established in South America, Africa and Asia, in several cases with van Hengel acting as a consultant. In 2007, The Global FoodBanking Network was formed.|$|E
40|$|Resume In {{this study}} we stress the fact that recent {{developments}} in the Danish welfare state are challenging the Danish <b>welfare</b> model <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. One {{of the most important}} changes in this context is the increased use of private, user charged <b>welfare</b> benefits such <b>as</b> private health insurance. This is a tendency that creates further disparity between those who cannot afford to buy a private health insurance and therefore have to wait longer for treatment than those who have one and can be instantly addressed to a private hospital or clinic. The problem is especially that private insurances are tax-deductible for employers who want to insurance their employees. This means that all citizens help finance private health insurances - but only the privileged citizens, who are part of the work force, get the advantage of them. The polarization will entail that the socioeconomically disadvantaged people {{do not have the same}} options and rights as the advantaged group, which makes us question the value of their citizenship. The analysis of disparity in the healthcare system leads to an analysis of possible changes in the Danish welfare model. Is the universalism in the Danish welfare state put to the test? And what kinds of underlying political trends is the cause of that? On the one hand, we believe that the Danish welfare state incorporates liberal principles, as in the US, when an otherwise public institution as the healthcare system is transformed from a common good to a consumer good. On the other hand, we also compare the changes in the healthcare system with more conservative welfare states like Germany, where the labour market functions as a social safety net. The universal tax-financed healthcare system is an essential part of the Danish welfare state and the privatizing of this sector is therefore determining for the development of the welfare state. The increasing disparity between classes in the healthcare system has consequences for the social cohesion in the Danish welfare state. Our concern is that this ultimately will lead to the socioeconomically advantaged group ‘opting out’ of the welfare project...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} of a largely contextual character: {{it seeks to}} show a {{comprehensive}} social and economic context which {{should be taken into}} account when considering the various futures of the institution of the university in Europe. Higher education research can make good use of broader, external contexts of transformations already taking place in the universities’ social and economic environments, we assume. Proposals of answers to the questions on external causes of transformations of educational systems and educational institutions (relatively homogeneous on a global scale) are essential to understanding what is changing in universities in Europe and what we could expect for them in the near future. In general terms, Europe is witnessing more general attempts at a reformulation of the post-war social contract which gave rise to the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it (with public higher education <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it). <b>We</b> argue here for a strong thesis according to which Europe is facing the simultaneous renegotiation of the postwar social contract concerning the welfare state in Europe and the accompanying renegotiation of a smallerscale, by comparison, modern social pact between the university and the nation-state. The present chapter is divided into four sections: a brief introduction, a section on the relationships between the university and the welfare state in Europe, a section on the relationships between the university and the nationstate in Europe, and tentative conclusions. It moves {{back and forth between the}} institution of the university and the institution of the state, seeing them as closely linked: problems of the latter inevitably bring about problems of the former, as historically, in the post-war period in Europe, the success of the latter led to the success of the former. We view the modern university and the modern state closely linked throughout the last two centuries, from the very beginning in the Humboldtian ideas of the research university from the early 1800 s. This way of thinking about the university and the state can be found in the ideas of new institutionalism in organization studies, especially those emerging in the last three decades in political sciences. Institutions do not undergo their transformations in isolation: institutions operate in parallel, and in parallel they change. There is a complex interplay of influences between institutions and their environments, and universities are perfect examples of powerful connectedness between changes in institutions and changes in the outside world from which they draw their resources, founding ideas, and social legitimacy. The institution of the university in Europe may be undergoing a fundamental transformation – along with the traditional institution of the state in general, and the welfare state in particular...|$|R
40|$|In The Decline of the Welfare State, Assaf Razin and Efraim Sadka use a {{political}} economy framework {{to analyze the}} effects of aging populations, migration, and globalization on the deteriorating system of financing <b>welfare</b> state benefits <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> them. Their timely analysis, supported by a unified theoretical framework and empirical findings, demonstrates how the combined forces of demographic change and globalization will {{make it impossible for}} the welfare state to maintain itself on its present scale. In much of the developed world, the proportion of the population aged 60 and over is expected to rise dramatically over the coming years – from 35 percent in 2000 to a projected 66 percent in 2050 in the European Union and from 27 percent to 47 percent in the United States – which may necessitate higher tax burdens and greater public debt to maintain national pension systems at current levels. Low-skill migration produces additional strains on welfare-state financing because such migrants typically receive benefits that exceed what they pay in taxes. Higher capital taxation, which could potentially be used to finance welfare benefits, is made unlikely by international tax competition brought about by globalization of the capital market. Applying {{a political}} economy model and drawing on empirical data from the EU and the United States, the authors draw an unconventional and provocative conclusion from these developments. They argue that the political pressure from both aging and migrant populations indirectly generates political processes that favor trimming rather than expanding the welfare state. The combined pressures of aging, migration, and globalization will shift the balance of political power and generate public support from the majority of the voting population for cutting back traditional welfare state benefits...|$|R

In the 2012 annual report of the Council of State, the nation’s supreme legal {{advisory}} body, its Vice-President, Piet Hein Donner, the so-called "Viceroy of the Netherlands", effectively announced the end of the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> now <b>know</b> it. And a year earlier the Minister of State for Security and Justice suggested that the current system of legal aid was no longer tenable. In some ways, then, this book comes an opportune moment, and in some ways it does not. This is the right time because we can already hear the rumbling of the approaching thunderstorm, but it is also premature because we cannot yet be sure where and how the storm will break. This contribution concerns the tenability of the system, the question of where its major costs lie and the measures which have been taken, or are being considered, to rein in that expense. Particular attention will be paid to a specific issue which is quite frequently cited as undermining the basic purpose of subsidised legal aid: assuring ordinary citizen access to the law. That is the fact that almost a fifth of all legal aid "certificates" issued in the Netherlands go to only 4 per cent of legal aid consumers, the so-called "multiple claimants". These are either people who face legal problems on a regular or systematic basis or individuals who suddenly encounter numerous such problems simultaneously. Before going into the phenomenon of multiple claimants in greater detail, at first a brief outline of the system itself shall be provided and of the policy challenges as perceived by the Minister of State for Security and Justice...|$|R
40|$|The {{crisis of}} the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>known</b> it in Italy and Europe {{over the last few}} decades has forced {{countries}} and the societies of those so-called "advanced countries" to review their priorities and the methods by which social services are provided. In this way a process has begun, which reflects on how to support the organization of a renewed sense of civic responsibility, able to satisfy demand and requirements where the Public and the Market, for various reasons, are not able to provide an adequate response. The entire sector, according to the information gathered during the 8 th General Census of Industry and Services carried out by Istat (the National Institute for Statistics) in 2001, adjusted in the 2003 annual report, includes: 2 5, 232 non-profit institutions, equal to 5. 4 % of all institutional units; approximately 488, 000 employees and independent workers, equal to 2. 5 % of all assigned workers; approximately 4 million individuals involved as volunteers  38 billion in revenue (over 3. 3 % of the GDP); 35 billion in costs, with a surplus of 3 billion reinvested in the activities carried out. These figures will obviously need to be updated following the growth in the world of non-profits over the last decade, but they are even more significant when accompanied by a calculation of the social savings deriving from the labour hours provided free of charge by the four million volunteers and, even more so, the material and immaterial well-being provided to those who benefited from their work, their help and their compassion.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on the Keynote Address to the European Conference on Educational Research (ECER), Dublin, Ireland, 7 - 10 September 2005. It argues that we are facing the {{simultaneous}} renegotiation of the major post-war social contract (concerning the welfare state) in Europe and the renegotiation of a smaller-scale modern social pact: the pact between the university and the nationstate. It suggests that the current, and especially future, transformations of the university are not fully clear outside of the context of transformations to the state (and to the public sector) under global pressures. These pressures, both directly and indirectly, will not leave the university as an institution unaffected. Thus it is more useful today than ever before to discuss the future of the university {{in the context of the}} current transformations of the state. The study is divided into four sections: a brief introduction; a section on the university and the welfare state in Europe; a section on the university and the nation-state in Europe; and tentative conclusions. The institution of the university seems already to have found it legitimate and necessary to evolve together with radical transformations of its social setting. For in the new global order, against the odds, universities are striving to maintain their traditionally pivotal role in society. The role of universities as engines of economic growth, contributors to economic competitiveness and suppliers of well-trained workers for the new knowledge-driven economy is being widely acknowledged. But it is undoubtedly a radical reformulation of the traditional social roles of the university. The main reasons for these transformations of the university include the globalisation pressures on nation-states and its public services, the end of the ‘Golden Age’ of the Keynesian <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>known</b> it, and the emergence of knowledge-based societies and knowledge-driven economies. More generally, the processes affecting the university today are not any different from those affecting the outside world; under both external pressures (like globalisation) and internal pressures (like changing demographics, the ageing of societies, maturation of welfare states, post-patriarchal family patterns and so forth), the processes in question are the individualisation (and recommodification) of our societies and the denationalisation (and desocialisation) of our economies. On top of that, we are beginning to feel at universities the full effects of the universalisation of higher education and the increasing commodification of research...|$|R

Conquering Poverty in the US by 1976 " (1967), "On Limiting the Domain of Inequality" (1970), "On Improving the Economic Status of the Negro" (1965), and "Raising the Incomes of the Poor" (1968). Tobin advocated means-tested cash transfers (negative income tax), to reduce poverty without interfering with market determination of relative prices (a position shared with Milton Friedman), paired with "non-market egalitarian distributions of commodities essential to life and citizenship" (education, food stamps, basic housing). The latter position contrasted with Friedman's Chicago school approach. Tobin's message continues to be relevant for reduction of poverty and inequality. Tobin's approach is contrasted with the neo-conservative analysis {{of the causes of}} poverty (exemplified by Herrnstein and Murray, but going back to Senior and Chadwick's Poor Law Report of 1834) that has been reflected in "the end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it".

State law-makers are eschewing job training in favor of work-first policies [...] mandating most public assistance recipients work or volunteer a minimum of twenty hours per week in exchange for benefits.

40|$|This article calls {{upon the}} social {{scientific}} research community to systematically assess policy devolution within American federalism {{through the lens}} of welfare reform. It asks specifically whether the benefits of policy devolution in this area— the opportunity to learn from policy experiments in similar states and the ability to tailor policies to individual state circumstances—outweigh the costs of devolution—possible racial biases across the states, incentives for cutting costs, and fears of a race to the bottom in benefits and eligibility criteria. A scientific research agenda for addressing these issues is developed. The contribution of De Jong et al. (2006) is assessed in terms of its advancement of this agenda. A path toward future contributions to this agenda is suggested. When the Republican 104 th Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996 with President Clinton’s blessing to ‘‘end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it,’ ’ it began a great and risky experiment.

40|$|What {{happened}} to the welfare state in the 1980 s and 1990 s? Not what you might have expected, according to Frank Castles A STORY prevalent in both academic circles and popular commentary {{over the past ten}} years is that the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> is doomed to extinction by globalisation of the world economy. In its most dramatic variant, this story is about an inevitable ‘race to the bottom’ in social expenditure as governments cut back programmes in order to reduce levels of taxation. Why must governments make such cuts? The answer we are given is that the costs of social provision, of better wages and conditions and of environmental safeguards necessarily fall on the production costs of businesses, making it more difficult for them to compete in international markets. Unless these costs are cut back, jobs will be lost and migrate overseas, while firms will close down, taking their capital with them. Why is this likely to happen now, when it didn’t happen in the past? The answer is that now there is more international trade and greater freedom of movement of capital. These are policy choices we have made in recent years to increase economic efficiency, but their consequence is that we can no longer build up generous welfare states behind tariff walls and ignore what is happening in the wider world. Governments may fear the wrath of the voters if they reduce welfare benefits, but that is as nothing to the likely reaction if there is massive unemployment because supposedly over-taxed businesses are forced to the wall. As Margaret Thatcher put it - and she put it pretty often - given such a choice, ‘There is no alternative!’. The people who tell such stories rarely test their accounts against what is happening in the real world. That is what I seek to do in this talk, which is part of a book I am presently writing on The Future of the Welfare State. A simple test of the ‘race to the bottom’ story is whether social expenditure - and, indeed, public expenditure as a whole - has been declining in recent years. To be a good test one needs to look at what has been happening over a longish period of years - I look at the period 1980 to 1998 - and in more than just one country - I look at 21 advanced Western countries - almost the entire universe of advanced welfare states. My analysis suggests that the idea of ‘race to the bottom’ is very far from the truth. In this nearly two decade period, when the international economy was rapidly becoming more closely integrated, social expenditure was actually growing not declining, going up from 18. 7 to 22. 7 of gross national product in the average Western nation. Nor is this just a matter of averages. Social expenditure increased in all but two of the 21 countries analysed. Only in Ireland and the Netherlands did spending decline. In Australia, many will be surprised to learn, it actually increased by 6. 5 per cent of GDP, well above the average for these nations, despite the very considerable moves that the Hawke/Keating/Howard governments made during these years to internationalise our economy. The same conclusion emerges from other figures I have looked at. Total spending by governments during this period remained stationary. So too did the generosity of benefits. All these measures look at expenditure levels as percentages of Gross Domestic Product. When we look at spending levels and benefits in real dollar terms, we find that expenditure increased markedly. Over the period as a whole, in the vast majority of these countries, spending on the welfare state became a more prominent part of total government spending than in the past. So the conclusion is that the ‘race to the bottom’ is just a story or what I call a ‘crisis myth’. So why invent crisis myths? Why say the welfare state is falling apart when, self-evidently, nothing of the kind is happening? The answer, I think, is pretty clear. The intention - where the commentator concerned is not simply parroting the line of the last ‘expert’ on the topic he or she {{happened to}} listen to - the intention is to persuade. To persuade us of what? And the answer there too is pretty obvious. To cut back the spending on the welfare state - on pensions for the old, on a decent heath system, on services to families - and to make it appear that such cuts are forced on us by outside forces. That there is no alternative! Frank Castles, professor of social and public policy at Edinburgh University, is a visiting fellow at the Naional Europe Centre.
