5|$|After the premiere, most reviews <b>were</b> <b>critical,</b> and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E

These <b>critical</b> characteristics <b>are</b> electron flux, electromagnetic radiation, vacuum, and temperature. The electron flux <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> because the solar winds through space bombard spacecraft. The electromagnetic radiation has many critical aspects in itself.

The Projected Man was featured in a ninth season episode of comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, and has been released on DVD by Cinema Club.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
