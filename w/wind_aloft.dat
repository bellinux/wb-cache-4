Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear.

40|$|Abstract: The {{most intense}} bora {{case on the}} {{northern}} Adriatic during the ALPEX- SOP (5 - 7 March 1982) was considered with emphasis {{on the surface and}} radiosounding data analyses. The bora onset was connected with a large increase of pressure gradient between the cold upstream air and a cyclone formed in the lee of the Alps. The vertical atmospheric structure shows the existence of stable layers inside and above the NE wind flow and SE <b>wind</b> <b>aloft.</b> It is shown that the strong bora appearance could be successfully described by the generalized hydraulic theory, especially at the time period with the strongest bora. The main problem still theoretically unsolved is the inclusion of the vertical wind shear in the upstream bora layer into theoretical consideration...|$|E
40|$|A "eld {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the mean and turbulent characteristics of air #ow within, and above, a street under neutral strati"cation. Pro"les of the mean wind and turbulent statistics were obtained and compared with #ow over smoother terrain. Our results modify the conventional picture of a persistent re-circulation within the street with small-scale turbulent #uctuations about this mean (Oke, 1987). Instead, the mean re-circulation within the street {{was found to be}} much weaker than the unsteady turbulent #uctuations. Hence, the mean #ow is merely a residual of an unsteady turbulent re-circulation. The re-circulation in the street is coupled to the <b>wind</b> <b>aloft</b> through a shear layer that develops at the roof-level. The shear layer is unstable, through Kelvin}Helmholtz instability, which leads to intermittency in the re-circulation in the street, and thence to ventilation of the air in the street.

The cloud tracking was based on three-dimensional data with a threshold of Tb < 210 K. During the campaign, westward-moving clouds were more dominant than eastward-moving systems, with a ratio of approximately 4 : 1. This characteristic coincided with the dominant easterly <b>wind</b> <b>aloft.</b> Most clouds propagated with a speed varying between 4 and 35 m/s, with a mean value of 13. 7 m/s.

Rainfall of 0. 01 inch or more occurred on 119 days during the year. Furthermore, the annual average temperature of 62. 2 degrees Fahrenheit was the coldest of any year in an available record that dates to 1964.

The coldest temperature for the year was 12. 5 degrees Fahrenheit (Jan 24) and the warmest temperature was 92. 4 degrees Fahrenheit (Aug 27). There were no significant occurrences of severe weather (ice/snow, tornado, sustained high wind) during the year.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{realization}} of the Italian Offshore Wind Atlas (IOWA) is presented. The IOWA is a natural extension and completion of the information already reported in the Italian Wind Atlas (IWA), produced in 2002 through a collaboration between the Italian Experimental Electrotechnical Centre (CESI) and the Department of Physics of the University of Genoa (DIFI). The wind fields above sea at different heights all along the Italian coast of the Mediterranean Sea have been computed through a procedure that combines statistical analyses of wind speed aloft with numerical modelling of wind flows offshore. The first step of this methodology is the statistical analysis of 10 years of wind speed and direction data at 5000 m above sea level from ECMWF “re-analyses”. The Italian offshore territory is then divided in a number of “geographic areas ” of the order of 200 × 200 km 2 which cover the sea as well as part of the inland in order {{to take into account the}} local effects induced by the coastal topography. Each area is discretized with a grid step of nearly 1 km, and it is partially overlapped with respect to its neighbouring areas in order to guarantee the continuity and smoothness between adjacent areas. 3 D wind flows are simulated by means of the diagnostic mass-consistent code WINDS, initialised by <b>wind</b> <b>aloft</b> values. Finally, the simulated wind fields are compared and corrected by means of the mean wind values measured in about 150 anemometric stations al...|$|E

40|$|In {{air traffic}} control, {{the wind is}} a {{critical}} factor because it affects, among other important variables, {{the amount of time}} an aircraft will take to reach its destination.

The method, which has been implemented at Lincoln Laboratory, gives a useful estimate of wind fields. One goal of air traffic control automation is the capability to land an aircraft at a runway within five to ten seconds of the planned arrival time. Such precision is difficult to attain because of the uncertainty of estimating <b>winds</b> <b>aloft,</b> which can significantly affect the amount of time an aircraft will take to reach its destination.
