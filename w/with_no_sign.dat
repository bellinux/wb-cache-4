As the years progressed <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an issue that was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} {{that one of}} them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, 1868, {{two weeks}} after Carpenter had {{returned}} to Fort Wallace with the survivors of Forsyth’s command, he was ordered out once again. Troops H and I of the 10th Cavalry sallied forth to escort Major Carr of the 5th Cavalry to his new command with supplies to Beaver Creek.

5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of their disappearance, an international search was launched to find Nungesser and Coli. Aviation Digest sponsored a well-known pilot, Floyd Bennett, to search the area between New York and Newfoundland for nine days. The Canadian government search and rescue organizations also sent out two search aircraft (one of which crashed). Searchers including the French Navy, the U.S. Navy, and the Royal Canadian Navy that scoured the route, including Labrador, the northeast coast of the U.S. and the area around the St. Lawrence River. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the aircraft, further search efforts were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Sydneys {{failure to}} reach Fremantle on 20 November was not {{initially}} cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, {{none of which}} were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November, 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, {{people began}} {{treasure}} hunting at Buckton Castle, and in 1767 {{there were reports}} that one such venture had discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local antiquarians and several visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of Buckton Castle. In the 20th century it was suggested that the castle may have been an Iron Age hillfort, however a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton Castle was topographically different from these sites. Excavation in the 1990s demonstrated that the site was medieval, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of earlier activity. It was also suggested that the castle was a ringwork – a type of fortification where earthworks formed {{an integral part of the}} defence. However, this was before archaeologists established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure. Buckton is now considered to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an}} hour and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E
