25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> on to the {{platform}} then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Although the Goons {{elevated}} Milligan {{to international}} stardom, {{the demands of}} writing and performing the series took a heavy toll. During Series 3 he suffered {{the first of several}} serious mental breakdowns, which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of manic-depressive illness. In late 1952, possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons' stars, Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he had to kill Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers's neighbouring flat, armed with a potato knife, he accidentally <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> through the plate-glass front door. He was hospitalised, heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating; fortunately for the show, a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production. Milligan later blamed the pressure of writing and performing The Goon Show, for both his breakdown and the failure of his first marriage.|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mommsen was {{imbued with}} the sense of need for a strong man {{to clean up the mess}} left by the failure of the German people to realize its {{political}} aspirations; and we shall never appreciate its history at its true value until we realize that his well-known idealization of Caesar is the product of this yearning for the strong man to save Germany from ruin, and that the lawyer-politician Cicero, that ineffective chatterbox and slippery procrastinator, has <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> out of the debates of the Paulikirche in Frankfurt in 1848." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{effective}} {{was this}} buffer that 109 men escaped the prison without ever being stopped. [...] At one point, Colonel Rose <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> {{into the path}} of an oncoming sentinel. [...] Unflinching, he [...] "strode boldly past the guard unchallenged." [...] Even more amazing, once news of the escape way broke out among the prisoners a panicked rush resulted, creating a thunderous stampede for the tunnel. [...] Wholly unsuspecting of the reality of the situation, one Confederate guard yelled out to a fellow sentry, [...] "Halloa, Bill—there’s somebody’s coffeepot upset, sure!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Swindon Town has had {{problems}} with hooliganism since the 1970s, with the first known group being called the Swindon Town Aggro Boys (STAB). In a home game against Wrexham in March 1978, STAB were responsible for pelting the opposing goalkeeper with darts, stones and a golf ball. Club chairman Cecil Green later proclaimed: [...] "We intend to stamp out this thuggery. The incidents were diabolical." [...] A new hooligan gang emerged in the 1980s, the Swindon Southside Firm (SSF), who were named after the area of terracing they occupied. In a match at Northampton Town, then manager Lou Macari <b>walked</b> <b>straight</b> into a group of more than 100 SSF members chasing Northampton fans up the street. Macari said the incident was [...] "worse than a Celtic–Rangers game".|$|E
40|$|A polygon P admits a {{walk from}} a {{boundary}} point s to another boundary point t if two guards can simultaneously {{walk along the}} two boundary chains of P from s to t such that they are always visible to each other. A walk is called a <b>straight</b> <b>walk</b> if no backtracking is required during the <b>walk.</b> A <b>straight</b> <b>walk</b> is discrete if only one guard is allowed to move at a time, while the other guard waits at a vertex. We present simple, optimal O(n) time algorithms to determine all pairs of points of P which admit <b>walks,</b> <b>straight</b> <b>walks</b> and discrete <b>straight</b> <b>walks.</b> The chief merits of the algorithms are that these require simple data structures and do not assume a triangulation of P. Furthermore, the previous algorithms for the <b>straight</b> <b>walk</b> and the discrete <b>straight</b> <b>walk</b> versions ran in O(n log n) time even after assuming a triangulation...|$|R
