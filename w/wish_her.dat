25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not <b>wish</b> <b>her</b> sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E

500|$|Angelou's {{issues are}} {{resolved}} {{at the end}} of Traveling Shoes when she decides to leave Guy to continue his education in Accra and return to America. [...] The final scene of the book is at the Accra airport, with Angelou surrounded by Guy and her friends as they <b>wish</b> <b>her</b> farewell. [...] Even though she [...] "forsakes her new embraced alliance with Mother Africa," [...] she claims she is [...] "not sad" [...] to be leaving. [...] She calls her departure a [...] "second leave-taking", and compares it to the last time she left her son, with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. [...] As Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World".|$|E

Ford visited during rehearsals to meet O'Brien and <b>wish</b> <b>her</b> luck. Rehearsals for the second episode took place from 7−10 December 1964, with the episode recorded on 11 December. Recording of the first episode overran its schedule by fifteen minutes. The Dido temple was a large set that was lit {{in such a way}} to create a dark atmosphere; dark drapes and smoke were also used. When shooting Vicki's Sand Beast, Jacqueline Hill underestimated the gun's power and fired too soon; she was not seriously injured, though suffered shock and a sore face because it blew back in her face. The sound the Sand Beast makes while dying was modelled after the [...] "horrible noise" [...] a dying Dalek made in The Daleks. To save money, the score is reused from The Daleks, which Barry had partially directed. He selected pieces from episodes one and four through to seven of that serial.|$|E
500|$|It was Plath's {{publication}} of Ariel in 1965 that precipitated her rise to fame. As {{soon as it}} was published, critics began to see the collection as the charting of Plath's increasing desperation or death <b>wish.</b> <b>Her</b> dramatic death became her most famous aspect, and remains so. Time and Life both reviewed the slim volume of Ariel in the wake of her death. The critic at Time said: [...] "Within a week of her death, intellectual London was hunched over copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. 'Daddy' was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, 'Daddy' was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life breathed a burning river of bile across the literary landscape. [...] In her most ferocious poems, 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus,' fear, hate, love, death and the poet's own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims. They are poems, as Robert Lowell says in his preface to Ariel, that 'play Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder.'" ...|$|E
