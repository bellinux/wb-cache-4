40|$|Strickland Produce Inc., Nashville, TN, {{packages}} fresh cut salads in {{bags for}} the ready-to-eat market. Produce is sorted, cut, washed, packed {{in plastic bags}} and distributed under refrigeration. <b>Flume</b> <b>water</b> washes and transports products through the plant, and is recycled in a closed loop. Ozone was installed full-scale in 2000 for <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> treatment (200 gpm) and has provided significant improvement in plant product qualities plus savings in water, labor, and plant effluent costs {{for the past six}} years. With chlorine treatment alone, the <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> quickly became discolored, laden with organic residues, and needed to be replaced every 2 – 3 hours. With the ozone treatment, <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> is replaced once daily, allowing for at least a 60 % <b>flume</b> <b>water</b> savings. Of even more significance are the labor savings resulting from less frequent changing of spent <b>flume</b> <b>water.</b> Costs for ozonation equipment were recovered in less than two years...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge is}} named after The Beebe Orchard Company which built the first bridge, a {{reinforced}} concrete tower suspension bridge, in 1919, over the Columbia River at Chelan Falls to carry irrigation water in two 12-inch <b>water</b> <b>flumes</b> from springs {{on the west side}} to their orchards {{on the east side of}} the river. The Beebe Bridge was the first suspension bridge in Washington State, was completed at a cost of $75,000, and was, at the time, the largest privately built and owned bridge in the world.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the park added several new <b>water</b> <b>flumes</b> {{including}} the Tornado, the Thunderbolt, and the Twin Twister {{as part of}} an ambitious expansion plan. Unlike the other flumes in the park whose frames were constructed of wood and concrete, the new ride's frames were made of steel. In 2006 the Twin Twister, ThunderBolt and Tornado were all taken out of service and dismantled. This was due to cost-cutting measures, as well as safety concerns. The steel frames of the rides were showing obvious signs of corrosion in the humid Central Florida environment.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{microbiological}} quality of ova harvested from mature chickens in commercial slaughter plants was studied. Greatest {{contamination of the}} product occurred at the location where ova were drawn from the carcasses. <b>Water</b> <b>fluming</b> and chilling procedures caused some reduction in contamination levels. Total aerobic plate counts, coagulase-positive staphylococci, presumptive Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts of chilled ova were low, and no salmonellae were detected on these samples. Since intact ova are shipped refrigerated to egg processing plants for further processing and pasteurization before use in food products, there should be little con-cern about microbial food safety of ova...|$|R

5000|$|The {{ballpark}} was generations {{ahead of}} its time in some ways. Along with the basic stands, Von der Ahe had built an adjoining amusement park, a beer garden, a race track in the outfield, a [...] "shoot-the-shoots" [...] <b>water</b> <b>flume</b> ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The side show notwithstanding, the club performed poorly on the field for most of the 1890s, consistently finishing at or near last place in the 12-team league as Von der Ahe sold off his best players {{in order to keep the}} club solvent.|$|E
5000|$|Legal {{problems}} plagued von der Ahe's ownership, {{especially in}} the later years. In an effort to recoup his losses, in 1892 he moved to a larger ballpark, which he surrounded with an amusement park, complete with beer garden, a horse track in the outfield, a [...] "shoot-the-shoots" [...] <b>water</b> <b>flume</b> ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The league, which prohibited gambling on its grounds, disapproved of the race track; so did von der Ahe's outfielders.

50|$|Journey to Atlantis {{begins as}} the boat is {{propelled}} via friction drives into a <b>water</b> <b>flume</b> meant to resemble an underwater canal. A siren beckons the boat closer until the mythical realm of Atlantis comes into view. The boat enters the city and all appears well, but soon the siren's true form is revealed, and the boat is carried {{up and out of}} the temple on a roller coaster chain lift hill. After a left-hand U-turn the boat starts up a second lift hill, entering a dry flume at the top of the hill that carries the boat to the large splash-down drop. The attraction's on-ride camera captures the boat's photograph as it slides down to the water below.|$|E

Projects include the Drift Park development on the promenade and the reopening of the town's miniature railway around the Marine Lake. The West End of Rhyl is undergoing much reconstruction. There is a major investment of about £4 million at Rhyl College, a satellite site of Llandrillo College. In 2015, plans were announced to demolish Rhyl Sun Centre indoor water park and build an exhibition centre in its place. The Sun Centre, which had heated pools, <b>water</b> <b>flumes</b> and a wave machine, opened in 1980 and closed in 2013.|$|R
