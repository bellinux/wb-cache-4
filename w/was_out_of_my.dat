500|$|Reflecting {{later on}} {{his years in}} Honolulu, Obama wrote: [...] "The {{opportunity}} that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became {{an integral part of}} my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear." [...] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to [...] "push questions of who I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind". Obama was {{also a member of the}} [...] "choom gang", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.|$|E
500|$|Two staff {{died during}} development: {{one in a}} {{motorcycle}} accident and the other from suicide. Futatsugi attributed the deaths to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry. In 2013, he said: [...] "All we could do was carry on and finish the game - it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands. Part of me did want to stop though. That was definitely the toughest project I've ever worked on. Personal relationships became strained. The stress was overwhelming." [...] Despite {{the difficulty of the}} project, he felt it had benefited from having [...] "someone who plays the bad guy role, someone who acts a little selfish, acts a little forceful to the team to achieve specific goals ... Having team members that will support that kind of bad cop is necessary, and if they don't exist then you can't get those kind of results." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E

500|$|Clayton {{made the}} news in August 1989 {{when he was arrested}} in Dublin for {{carrying}} a small amount of marijuana. However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and later commented [...] "it was my own fault. And I'm sure I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head– emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal." [...] Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head during the Zoo TV Tour. On 26 November 1993 he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night's show in Sydney, the dress rehearsal for their [...] Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton's technician Stuart Morgan. After that incident, however, he gave up alcohol. On 26 June 2017, Clayton received the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the MusiCares 13th annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert in recognition of his commitment to helping others with addiction recovery.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E

"When {{they asked}} me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} belie her,' said Heathcliff, {{twisting}} {{his chair to}} face them. 'She wishes to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> society now, at any rate!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I will be serious--serious enough. I {{can afford}} to be so, as I have {{received}} my medical passport for to-morrow.

2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was long}} ill after that. A good while, they say, I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, but old Ignacio nursed me through. He also buried Mariquita where she now lies." ...|$|E
60|$|This last request it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> power--really {{out of my}} power--to grant. Winterfield {{had left}} London that morning on his visit to Paris. His address there was, thus far, not known to me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In that respect, then, {{somewhat}} resembling you, Charley,' replied his lordship, {{who did not}} {{admire the}} appeal. 'For no one can doubt you plagued your father; I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> teens, fortunately, before you played écarté.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do ye not speak, man?" [...] he said again; and I {{turned my}} eyes on him, looking as pitifully as might <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> blood-bedabbled face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, ma'am. I {{will make}} up my mind to that--not to touch liquor till I <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> apprenticeship. After that, I can see for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you refer}} to the {{contents}} of that letter, it was written and handed to me about three hours ago. It has not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> possession since then." ...|$|R
60|$|I was trapp'd by the Serjeant's palavering pretences, He listed me when I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> senses. So I took leave to-day of all {{care and}} all sorrow And was drill'd to repentance and reason to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I never <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native country,' {{said the}} Doctor. 'I once, indeed, was {{about making the}} grand tour with a pupil of mine at Oxford, but {{circumstances}} interfered which changed his plans, and so I remain a regular John Bull.' ...|$|E
60|$|Before I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{room in the}} morning, my {{mind was}} upset {{by the arrival of}} a {{telegram}} addressed to myself. It was the first thing of the kind I ever received; I trembled under the prevision of some new misfortune as I opened the envelope.|$|E
6000|$|... "What like was he?" [...] said Steadfast. [...] "We {{looked at}} a many of the poor corpses that lay there. They'll never <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes again at night!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line," [...] said La Fleur, {{shaking her}} head, [...] "out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line. I can cook for them, but I can't {{help them to}} be teachers." ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{the words}} <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, I saw that I {{had made a}} mistake. The balance of her mind was poised between {{suspicion}} and belief, and my offer turned the scale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes!' cried Mrs Varden, {{bursting}} into tears, 'yes, you would. I don't doubt it, Varden. Certainly you would. That's {{as much as}} {{to tell me that}} you would be hovering round me like a vulture, waiting till the breath <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body, that you might go and marry somebody else.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{their faces}} {{remained}} black, it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> power to recognize either. The rascal {{who had been}} felled by the blow of the rifle was yet confused in manner, and I ordered the domestics to wash him, in the double expectation of bringing him more completely to his senses, and of ascertaining who he might be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew him}} well," [...] the King said graciously, [...] "but {{had not heard}} of his death. I am {{glad to hear that}} his son {{inherits}} his bravery. I have often regretted deeply that it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> power to requite, in any way, the services Sir Aubrey rendered, and the sacrifices he made for our House." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O dear! Then I am glad he <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house. Really! {{we might}} {{all have been}} murdered in our beds!" [...] And the woman held up her thin hands in horror.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock, and went {{straight}} into the inner pocket <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat; it has not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> possession for a single second. Even while I talk to you I can feel it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she {{interposed}} hastily, [...] "not before I <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> room. I {{shall be}} down to breakfast with Marian. I {{am not so}} ungrateful, not so forgetful {{of the past three}} months----" ...|$|R
