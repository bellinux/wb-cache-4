5|$|The United States Soccer Federation {{determined}} {{the host of}} the final with a coin flip on August 4, 2014. The winner of the toss was <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> victorious in the FC Dallas/Philadelphia Union semifinal, meaning that the game would take place at PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania. It was the eleventh time the greater-Philadelphia region hosted the final and the first since 1994. The Union marketed the game by publicly displaying the trophy at local restaurants, landmarks, and events.|$|E
5|$|Frankie dies next at a drive-through, when {{a runaway}} truck crashes {{into the back}} of Kevin's truck and the engine fan blows out. The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them that he does not believe them shortly before two weights from the weight {{training}} machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Tommy Vercetti (Ray Liotta), a loyal {{former member}} of the Forelli Family, is {{released}} from prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence. His former boss, Sonny Forelli (Tom Sizemore), ostensibly promotes Tommy to a caporegime and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer in a cocaine deal and to also do other ground work for the Forellis. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg (William Fichtner) takes them in his car to the docks; the site of the deal. They are ambushed by several masked men, who kill their bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, losing the Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. After Ken returns to his office, Tommy drives back to his hotel and informs Sonny, promising him under the threat of consequences to get back the drugs and money and kill <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the ambush.|$|E
5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E

25|$|The 1920s {{immediately}} after the war was marked by instability. The governorship changed hands frequently with resistance to <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> in power {{from other parts of}} the state. Despite this, the Universidad de Puebla was established by Maximino Ávila Camacho during this decade. True political stability would not come until the governorship of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz in 1942.|$|E
25|$|At RKO's request, Welles {{worked on}} an {{adaptation}} of Eric Ambler's spy thriller, Journey into Fear, co-written with Joseph Cotten.

25|$|Some jurisdictions have {{ameliorated}} {{specific problems}} of the rule by creating statutory presumptions to counter those problems.

He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers.

25|$|Two contestants {{selected}} from the studio audience competed in various games to earn points as well as cash and prizes.

If the score was tied after three games, one sudden death tune was played to determine the winner; if both players were incorrect, the procedure was repeated.|$|E

Critics wondered whether the Holy See should remain neutral or whether it should assume a position of moral leadership by casting public judgments on the behaviour of the various combatants.|$|E
25|$|After {{beginning}} 1996 {{with two}} more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated puncher Mark Delaney (21–0). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics {{said that he had}} still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and Pat Lawlor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he was not}} {{eager to}} cling to his {{position}} in government, Buenaventura nonetheless stated that the stability of a fixed six-year term for a central bank governor {{was more important than}} the actual person sitting on the chair. Philippine governance was already under attack from the international community; it was seen not merely as unstable, but downright whimsical, depending on the mood of <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> wielding the power at any given moment. Buenaventura thus refused to resign, even as a courtesy to the new president. It was at this time that he made public his second career: counting the years, months, weeks, days and minutes {{to the end of his}} six-year term.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day two Iranian nuclear {{scientists}} were targeted in separate, but nearly simultaneous car bomb attacks near Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. Majid Shahriari, a quantum physicist was killed. Fereydoon Abbasi, a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Defense was seriously wounded. Wired speculated that the assassinations could indicate that <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> behind Stuxnet {{felt that it was}} not sufficient to stop the nuclear program. That same Wired article suggested the Iranian government could have been behind the assassinations. In January 2010, another Iranian nuclear scientist, a physics professor at Tehran University, was killed in a similar bomb explosion. On 11 January 2012, a Director of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, was killed in an attack quite similar to the one that killed Shahriari.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{it became}} known at Pisa {{that two of the}} {{cardinals}} of the Obedience of Benedict XIII had abandoned his cause. Cardinal Ludovico Fieschi and Cardinal Antoine de Challant had been declared contumacious in the Fourth Session of the Council, and they were now negotiating to have their status regularized. At Session Sixteen, on 10 June, Cardinal Challant appeared in the Cathedral, and the question {{of what to do with}} him suddenly became critical. Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio (Avignon Obedience) spoke in his favor, and he was allowed to take his seat with the other cardinals. Then, the Archbishop of Pisa read out a document containing Electoral Capitulations, signed and sealed by each of the cardinals, promising that <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> elected pope would carry out a reform of the Church, and would not allow the Council to dissolve until that goal had been achieved.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, French {{judges were}} given a list by an {{anonymous}} source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin's rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 {{months at a time}} when the two men were vying for party supremacy. Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin's, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to defame his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> behind the creation of the Clearstream list. Villepin was eventually acquitted in 2010 (see Clearstream trial below).|$|E
