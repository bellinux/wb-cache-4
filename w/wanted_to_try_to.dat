5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 with a list of songs they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> record, such as a disco song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them to write down her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided not to move to another studio.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make the story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw {{in the first half of}} Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron.|$|E
5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> move it.|$|E

McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay home and take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer.

500|$|After {{releasing}} Stripped (2002) and {{collaborating with}} many different artists, Aguilera decided to record new old-school style materials for her upcoming album. She later {{explained that the}} lengthy break allowed her to write {{a lot about what}} she had experienced during that time. Aguilera also explained that she wanted to bring something novel to her album, which has 24 songs on it. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> evolve as an artist and a visionary. As a result, Back to Basics, Aguilera's fifth studio album, is made up of two discs. On the first disc, she worked with [...] "more beat-driven" [...] producers, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second one was written and produced solely by longtime producer Linda Perry. Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel. She described the first disc as [...] "kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats".|$|E

[...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write [...] "a story {{in the mind of}} a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E

The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put out". On March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs.

500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel, and pretty much left us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E

After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script.

[...] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> cure the defects in his suit.
