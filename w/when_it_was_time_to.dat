5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E

25|$|The {{interlocutor}} {{was responsible}} for beginning and ending each segment of the show.

25|$|By this point, Elton John was {{starting}} to lose interest in Sedaka. Members of John's inner circle, jealous of Sedaka's success, worked to undermine the friendship by telling John falsehoods about Sedaka. Consequently, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> renegotiate Sedaka's contract with Rocket, John did not offer Sedaka {{the amount of money}} he was looking for, and he did not promote Steppin' Out as extensively as he had Sedaka's Back and The Hungry Years.

The Zuo Zhuan recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the Qi state and cause the destruction of the Meng family. Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to {{dismantle the}} walls.|$|E

25|$|Two pianos (duo) – Holst had {{originally}} sketched {{the work for}} two pianos, due to a need {{to compensate for the}} neuritis in his right arm. His two friends Nora Day, and Vally Lasker had agreed to play for him the two-piano arrangement as he dictated the details of the orchestral score to them. This they wrote down themselves on the two-piano score, and used as a guide <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> create the full orchestral score. The two-piano arrangement was published in 1949. Holst's original manuscripts for it are now in the holdings of the Royal College of Music (Mars, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), Royal Academy of Music (Mercury) and British Library (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus).|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{argue the}} Elaine 12 {{case before the}} Supreme Court, the NAACP decided to replace Jones with Moorfield Storey of Boston, {{founding}} president of the NAACP since 1909, and former assistant U.S. attorney Ulysses S. Bratton of Little Rock. Jones continued to support the cases, and in 1923 the Supreme Court ruled in Moore v. Dempsey that, for the first time, collateral attack through habeas corpus was permissible on a state appellate court decision. It was a landmark precedent that marked the Court's review of state criminal cases {{from the point of}} view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. During the trials, Jones received frequent lynching threats while in Arkansas. He was said to have shifted his location each night because of the risk to his safety.|$|E
25|$|Empire Cowdray {{was built}} for the MoWT. She was {{initially}} operated under {{the management of the}} Alexander Steamship Company. Following completion in October 1944, two days of sea trials were held before the ship entered service. Following these, a cargo of coal was loaded at Hendon Docks. Once loading was complete, the crew were given a brief shore leave so that they could have a beer before the ship sailed to join a convoy. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sail, the crew ignored orders to return to their ship, not returning until being threatened with being put in jail. When the crew did return to the ship, they were too drunk to sail, causing the ship to miss the convoy. After they had sobered up, the crew were all fined for refusing the lawful command of the Captain and causing the ship to miss the convoy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the main}} event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was {{revealed}} to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. During the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on an announce table on Reigns, who then performed a spear through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who performed a chokeslam on Reigns onto a chair for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns executed another spear but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with a chair, and performed two spears - both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature sit-up, but suddenly collapsed. After another spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania, after Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat, and hat {{in the center of}} the ring, hinting that this was possibly his last match. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character and kissed his wife, Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked at the crowd and raised his arm as he was lowered below the stage to the sound of his music and his signature gong sounded three times as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening, and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring as the production crew cleaned up, only taking his clothing articles <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> disassemble the ring.|$|E

500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> call a vote, the {{presiding}} magistrate could bring up whatever proposals (in whatever order) he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative. Quorums were required for votes to be held, {{and it is}} known that in 67 BC the size of a quorum was set at 200 senators (by the lex Cornelia de privilegiis). At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be vetoed. Usually, vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes. If the Senate proposed a bill that the plebeian tribune (the magistrate who was the chief representative of the people) did not agree with, he issued a veto, which was backed by the promise to literally [...] "'interpose the sacrosanctity of his person'" [...] (or intercessio) if the Senate did not comply. If the Senate did not comply, he could physically prevent the Senate from acting, and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity. If the vetoed motion was proposed the next day, and the plebeian tribune who had vetoed it the day before was not present to interpose himself, the motion could be passed. In general, the plebeian tribune had to physically be present at the Senate meeting, otherwise his physical threat of interposing his person had no meaning. Ultimately, the plebeian tribune's veto was based in a promise of physical force.|$|E
