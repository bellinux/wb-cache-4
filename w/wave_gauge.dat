40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to use the {{software}} of MATLAB for processing the direct and reflected signals of GPS to monitor altitude of water surface in the water flume, as well as to establish a practicable technique of measuring sea water level. It is because before determining water wave pattern, the feasibility and accuracy of reflected GPS method must be proved. Therefore, there was a field test in the Mid-size wave flume of the Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory, National Cheng Kung University. After improving RGPS positioning procedure, the tranquil water level and the steadily descending of water level observation for one hour were performed. In this research, an integrated GPS receiver that employed direct and reflected GPS signals for the measurement was introduced. Both RHCP and LHCP antennas were employed to simultaneously receive the L 1 and L 2 carrier phase of direct and reflected signals. After the data analysis of the GPS observation, the position of signal reflection and the water level of the wave were solved. The results of the RGPS, <b>wave</b> <b>gauge,</b> and staff meter were coincided within 0. 5 cm ~ 1. 0 cm. The differences between the reflection heights of this GPS system and the record of <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> were almost identical within 90 %. It is proved the reflected GPS technique is possible to monitor water surface altitude and determine water wave patterns. ...|$|E

30|$|The 2011 off the Pacific {{coast of}} Tohoku Earthquake {{occurred}} at 05 : 46 : 23 on 11 March, 2011 (UTC). The {{epicenter of the}} earthquake (38.104 °N, 142.861 °E) was southeast of Sendai City and its moment magnitude (Mw) was 9.0, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which means that {{it was probably the}} largest earthquake in the recorded history of Japan.

40|$|A new optical <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> {{was built}} to measure {{simultaneously}} two statistical parameters of wind induced water surface waves, namely the surface slope and surface amplitude probability distribution functions. The new instrument was tested in a linear wind wave flume with a water depth of 10 cm. The surface slope is determined using the refraction of light at the water surface. The wave amplitude is measured using the absorption of infrared light in the water column. The <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> consists of a point-like dichromatic light source which is positioned under the flume (Ulbricht sphere with high-power LEDs, (RED = 632 nm and IR = 850 nm) and a camera above the flume that looks vertically through the water into the light source. No other optical components are needed. The light source is pulsed and the camera is triggered. The images show light speckles whose positions are a measure for the wave slope. The relative intensities are a measure for the wave amplitude. These quantities are derived from the digital images by means of image processing and simple geometrical considerations. The influence of different analysis methods on the wave slope and amplitude distribution was studied. For the characterization of the new linear wind wave flume in the Institut fuer Umweltphysik (IUP), Heidelberg, mean square slope and root mean square wave height were measured for a wind speed up to 6. 7 m/s and a fetch between 0. 80 m and 2. 40 m.

The buoys use an AXYS Technologies TRIAXYS directional wave sensor and a downward looking 1 MHz Nortek Aquadopp Profiler for current profiles. In this experiment, a bottom mounted Nortek acoustic wave and current (AWAC) profiler was deployed next to one buoy in 7 m water for 1 month (April 2008) to collect reference current and wave data to evaluate the performance of the buoy <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> in the small, short waves common to the region, and to understand how buoy motion affects the fidelity of the current measurements. Over 75 % of the total current velocity energy was well described by a regional tidal model. The buoy-mounted current profiler compared well with the bottom-mounted current profiler in both speed and direction at all depth cells. For all currents greater than 0. 1 m/s, the mean of the absolute value of the difference in current magnitude was less than 0. 01 m/s. The mean of the absolute value of difference in current direction was 5 °. An analysis of average intervals demonstrated that an average interval of 2 minutes achieved 96 % of the best possible measurement compared to a 10 minute average. Significant wave height ranged from 0. 1 - 0. 7 m and peak periods varied from 2 - 4 s. The buoy mounted <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> reported wave period accurately, but may under-report significant wave height.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2005. Experiments on regular two {{dimensional}} waves breaking over an artificial sand bar {{were conducted in}} a glass walled flume to facilitate {{an investigation of the}} hydrodynamic processes that evolve in the surf zone. The instantaneous time averaged velocities and the velocity flow fields have been measured using digital video imaging and analysis techniques. The instantaneous velocity flow fields were then processed, resulting in the phase-ensemble-averaged velocities, time averaged velocities and energy and momentum fluxes. The time averaged velocities above the trough level {{have been found to be}} much higher than those below. After wave breaking, kinetic energy and momentum flux are shown to increase, reaching a peak value and decreasing thereafter. An estimate of the relative density of the fluid in the wave crests was obtained by comparing the forward and reverse velocity fluxes. Other surf zone physical parameters such as the free surface displacements, wave heights across the flume and potential energies have been derived from the resistive <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements. A spectral analysis of the water level time series was conducted and the energy growth in each spectral component was examined. It was noticed that there is a transfer of energy from the primary frequency of the wave maker to higher harmonics. Also, wave breaking has little effect on the amplitudes of the harmonic components. The roller and aeration areas were also computed. Two methods of estimating the roller area have been explored and these are the analysis of the <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements of the surface elevation and the analysis of the video images.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1976 A {{bottom mounted}} surface <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> was {{operated}} in 70 m of water near Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska for 10 days in October and November 1973. Standard fast-Fourier transform techniques {{have been applied}} to the data, and a second-order lowpass Butterworth filter {{has been designed to}} examine low-frequency components in the record. During the time the <b>wave</b> <b>gauge</b> was in operation, two earthquakes were reported with epicenters near the middle of the Aleutian Islands. The first had a surface wave magnitude of 6. 4 on the Richter scale; the second, which occurred about 9 hours later, had a surface wave magnitude of 6. 3. Spectra for data taken after the occurrence of these earthquakes have shown that generation of ocean waves by these quakes is questionable. Hourly spectra from {{the first part of the}} record reveal a peak around 0. 065 Hz which moves toward higher frequencies for about 18 hours. The frequency of the peak then remains constant for about 24 hours, after which it again increases. The changes are well correlated with a large storm which remained stationary in the North Pacific, then moved rapidly into the Gulf of Alaska and subsided. Wave group velocities are used to estimate possible distances of the wave source from the gauge. The actual distances of the storm from the gauge show a close correlation with wave-derived distances. Comparison with changes in wave spectra for a storm in the North Atlantic in March 1968 indicates the same time rate of change in the spectral peak as was found in the North Pacific for time periods when the storms are subsiding...|$|E
30|$|Tsunami {{waveform}} inversion for the 11 March, 2011, off the Pacific {{coast of}} Tohoku Earthquake (M 9.0) {{indicates that the}} source of the largest tsunami was located near the axis of the Japan trench. Ocean-bottom pressure, and GPS <b>wave,</b> <b>gauges</b> recorded two-step tsunami waveforms: a gradual increase of sea level (~ 2 m) followed by an impulsive tsunami wave (3 to 5 m). The slip distribution estimated from 33 coastal tide <b>gauges,</b> offshore GPS <b>wave</b> <b>gauges</b> and bottom-pressure gauges show that the large slip, more than 40 m, was located along the trench axis. This offshore slip, similar but much larger than the 1896 Sanriku “tsunami earthquake,” is responsible for the recorded large impulsive peak. Large slip on the plate interface at southern Sanriku-oki (~ 30 m) and Miyagi-oki (~ 17 m) around the epicenter, a similar location with larger slip than the previously proposed fault model of the 869 Jogan earthquake, is responsible for the initial water-level rise and, presumably, the large tsunami inundation in Sendai plain. The interplate slip is ~ 10 m in Fukushima-oki, and less than 3 m in the Ibaraki-oki region. The total seismic moment is estimated as 3.8 × 1022 N m (Mw = 9.0).|$|R
