25|$|These early prototypes, {{initially}} designated wz. 1981, were {{modeled on}} the Soviet 5.45mm AK-74 assault rifle and emphasized {{a high degree of}} parts commonality with the AKM rifle. As the weapon was intended to be able to launch rifle grenades, a newly designed, multi-functional muzzle device and a sturdier folding shoulder stock were used (the <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> is a copy of the <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> used on the East German MPi-KMS-72 rifle). Additionally, the wz. 81 was equipped with a mechanically limited burst fire mode, borrowed from the AKMS wz. 1980 prototype developed in the late 1970s by OBR.|$|E
25|$|The weapon’s {{design was}} {{authored}} {{by the team}} of engineers at OBR in Radom, {{under the guidance of}} B. Szpaderski. The rifle was produced exclusively with a folding <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> by the Łucznik Arms Factory in Radom.|$|E
25|$|A four-slide, {{also known}} as a multislide, multi-slide, or four-way, is a {{metalworking}} machine tool used in the high-volume manufacture of small stamped components from bar or <b>wire</b> <b>stock.</b> The press is most simply described as a horizontal stamping press that uses cams to control tools. The machine is used for progressive or transfer stamping operations.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{materials}} {{needed to}} make nylon flowers include: wire, stem <b>wire,</b> nylon <b>stocking,</b> nylon threading, floral tape and stamen. Some flowers require cotton balls or sheets (or batting), white glue, acrylic paint and paint brushes.|$|R
50|$|The Škorpion is {{equipped}} with open-type iron sights (mechanically adjustable forward post and flip rear sight with 75 and 150 m range notches) and a folding metal <b>wire</b> shoulder <b>stock,</b> which folds {{up and over the}} receiver and is locked on the front sight’s protection capture.|$|R
50|$|The Beretta AR70/90 is a gas {{operated}} self-loading rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, {{and is the}} standard issue service rifle of the Italian Armed Forces. The weapon is also designed to be fitted with a rifle grenade, and has grenade sights. The AR series comes in many variants such as the AR90, with a <b>wire</b> folding <b>stock,</b> for use by paratroopers.|$|R
25|$|Projecting to {{the rear}} was a {{one-piece}} <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> made from a formed steel rod that telescoped into tubes {{on both sides of}} the receiver. Both ends of the stock were tapped and drilled so that it could be used as a cleaning rod. It could also be used as a disassembly tool or as a wrench used to unscrew the barrel cap.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> at the butt end.|$|E
50|$|Applications include <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> and {{electrical}} connections (such as insulation-displacement connectors and wire wrap connections).|$|E
50|$|The {{machine pistol}} may be {{fitted with a}} wooden (early), brown {{bakelite}} or steel <b>wire</b> shoulder <b>stock</b> (for the APB variant); otherwise, the weapon becomes difficult to control on full auto. The stock is attached via a T-slot cut into the rear strap of the pistol frame. The stock is hollowed out and {{can act as a}} holster, accepting the machine pistol inside, similar to the Mauser C96 pistol.|$|R
5000|$|It uses {{either a}} [...] "bird cage" [...] flash suppressor, or a flash hider (designed for Special Forces). The design also {{incorporates}} an upward-curved charging handle, a <b>wire</b> side-folding <b>stock</b> (based on the East German design, but offset {{slightly to the}} left), and a traditional vertical handgrip. The md. 86 use laminated wood lower handguards, and Bakelite pistol grips and upper handguards. None of the components have had any polymer versions.|$|R
5000|$|The M4 was {{developed}} from the Harrington & Richardson bolt-action M265 sporting rifle, adapted to a sheet metal frame with telescoping <b>wire</b> butt <b>stock,</b> a 14-inch detachable barrel chambered for [...]22 Hornet and the 4 shot detachable box magazine of the Savage Stevens M23D [...]22 Hornet sporting rifle. The M4 weighs approximately four pounds and with barrel detached and telescoping stock closed makes a ~14 inch overall package.|$|R
5000|$|The rifled-barrel variant was {{produced}} from 1930-1934 and it featured a 12¼" [...] barrel. It {{was available in}} [...]22 WRF, [...]32-20 and possibly other centerfire cartridges. [...] Some guns were originally factory fitted with a <b>wire</b> <b>stock.</b> Production was halted {{with the passage of}} the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA34). Rifled versions with a detachable <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> are a short-barrel rifle under federal law and require registration. Pistols without the stock are exempt.|$|E
50|$|The MP-9 is a {{shortened}} {{version with}} a skeletal <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> and no barrel jacket. Both the Mk.9 and the MP-9 {{are available in}} semi/full automatic versions.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the MPi 69, {{it has a}} simple <b>wire</b> <b>stock,</b> and its working principle is the telescoping bolt. It uses the 9 mm Parabellum cartridge.|$|E
50|$|One unusual {{feature is}} the ability to store a spare 44-round {{magazine}} {{at the rear of the}} gun, where it also functions as a <b>stock.</b> A <b>wire</b> folding <b>stock</b> is also available. Another unusual feature is that this firearm's charging handle is located directly behind the front sight and folds out of the way when not in use. A similar folding charging handle can be seen on the Heckler & Koch G36.|$|R
5000|$|The Pistol Mitralieră model 1990 is the 7.62mm {{response}} to the 5.45mm Pușcă Automată model 1986. It is internally identical to a PM md. 63/65, and outwardly differs in {{that it has a}} <b>wire</b> folding <b>stock</b> identical to the PA md. 86 stock, and that all of the rifles are fitted with slant brakes. It was extensively used in the Romanian Revolution of 1989 along with the md. 63 and md. 65 ...|$|R
50|$|Microinverters {{have several}} {{advantages}} over conventional inverters. The main {{advantage is that}} small amounts of shading, debris or snow lines on any one solar module, or even a complete module failure, do not disproportionately reduce {{the output of the}} entire array. Each microinverter harvests optimum power by performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for its connected module. Simplicity in system design, lower amperage <b>wires,</b> simplified <b>stock</b> management, and added safety are other factors introduced with the microinverter solution.|$|R
50|$|Main variant, The FMK-3 has a {{retractable}} <b>wire</b> <b>stock.</b> Fixed {{stocks have}} been recently made {{that can be}} installed by two prongs. FMK-3s have also been adapted with picatinny rails.|$|E

5000|$|They {{came with}} either a fixed <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> or one that slid forward {{for use as a}} [...] "bicycle rifle" [...] nearly {{identical}} with the stock later used on the USAF M4 survival rifle.|$|E
50|$|Because Exchange instead uses MAPI/RPC on the <b>wire,</b> the <b>stock</b> Outlook {{connector}} for Exchange {{could not}} be used and traditionally required the Windows version of the Zarafa MAPI provider (a product that is proprietary and unsupported since 2016-04). Outlook versions 2010/2013 and newer support ActiveSync, a protocol also used by many mobile clients, and by using the Z-push software on the server side, ActiveSync requests can be translated and such clients can effectively talk to a Kopano server as well.|$|R
25|$|The Tantal {{features}} a metal <b>wire</b> side-folding <b>stock</b> (folds {{to the right}} side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} handguard and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Stansberry founded Stansberry Research, {{a private}} {{publishing}} {{company based in}} Baltimore, Maryland. He {{is the editor of}} the internet financial newsletters Porter Stansberry's Investment Advisory and Porter Stansberry’s Put Strategy Report. He also contributes regularly to Daily Wealth and The Growth <b>Stock</b> <b>Wire,</b> other Stansberry Research publications.|$|R

5000|$|Influence by some popular WW-II-era designs is apparent. The [...] "Cutts" [...] type barrel {{compensator}} {{and cooling}} rings {{are reminiscent of}} the Thompson submachine gun, the <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> looks like the M3 submachine gun, the bolt design is nearly identical to the Sten and the magazine is almost {{the same as the}} one designed for the MP40.|$|E
50|$|The forend and {{buttstock}} are synthetic black polymer {{with the}} latter having a synthetic rubber recoil pad mounted on the end. One model was issued instead with a heavy <b>wire</b> gauge folding <b>stock</b> and pistol grip. Models were available with either a black anodized protective finish, matte finish, or were finished in carbon fiber.|$|R
50|$|The m/45 {{has been}} {{manufactured}} under license in Egypt as the Port Said and the Akaba. The tooling needed for production, {{as well as}} technical assistance, was sold by Sweden to Egypt during the 1950s. The Port Said looks and functions exactly as the M/45 while the Akaba is a modified and simplified version. The Akaba has no barrel jacket and a slightly shorter barrel and the folding butt stock {{has been replaced by}} a telescoping <b>wire</b> butt <b>stock</b> similar to the one used on the US M3A1 and the French MAT-49 sub machine guns. The simplified sights of the Akaba were moved to the front (unprotected post) and back (protected peep) of the receiver.|$|R
50|$|Shot peening {{is used on}} gear parts, cams and camshafts, clutch springs, coil springs, {{connecting}} rods, crankshafts, gearwheels, {{leaf and}} suspension springs, rock drills, and turbine blades. It is also used in foundries for sand removal, decoring, descaling, and surface finishing of castings such as engine blocks and cylinder heads. Its descaling action {{can be used in}} the manufacturing of steel products such as strip, plates, sheets, <b>wire,</b> and bar <b>stock.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Strojnica Mini ERO is a clone of the Micro Uzi; {{it differs}} {{in that it}} had a {{heavy-gauge}} folding <b>wire</b> <b>stock</b> like the Vz.61 Skorpion Machine Pistol. It weighs 2.2 kg / 4.85 lbs. unloaded and is 545.5 mm / 21.47 inches overall with the folding stock extended and 250 mm / 9.84 inches with the stock folded.It uses the 20-round Mini Uzi magazine.|$|E
5000|$|Long Barrelled Pistols (LBP) The LBPs are {{generally}} semi automatic, although single shot designs {{are available and}} are sometimes used for precision events. Like the LBRs they are modified to comply with UK firearms regulations. Often based on a 1911, with a 300mm barrel and permanently attached <b>wire</b> <b>stock,</b> increasing the overall length to 620mm. LBPs are chambered in [...]22 Long Rifle caliber only, {{and can be used}} for all events.|$|E
40|$|Sometimes we are our {{own worst}} enemies. Research shows that our brains are <b>wired</b> to trade <b>stocks</b> actively, and this often works against us. Even {{professional}} managers (such as mutual funds) {{have a hard}} time generating consistent outperformance. So, the best managers may be those that understand the psychology of investing and are able to control themselves. See the article here, Wall Street Journal. A good book on the topic is Psychology of Investing, by John Nofsinger...|$|R
50|$|Spot welding is {{typically}} used when welding particular types of sheet metal, welded wire mesh or <b>wire</b> mesh. Thicker <b>stock</b> {{is more difficult}} to spot weld because the heat flows into the surrounding metal more easily. Spot welding can be easily identified on many sheet metal goods, such as metal buckets. Aluminium alloys can be spot welded, but their much higher thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity requires higher welding currents. This requires larger, more powerful, and more expensive welding transformers.|$|R
2500|$|The 15 line {{returned}} to trolley service in September 2005 {{after having been}} served by buses for thirteen years. To prepare for the resumption of trolley service, SEPTA spent a total of $100 million, including rehabilitating the tracks and repairs to the overhead <b>wires.</b> The rolling <b>stock</b> for Route 15 consists of PCC II cars, which are 1947 St. Louis Car-built PCC streetcars that had been completely rebuilt by the Brookville Equipment Company as a cost of $1.3 million per trolley in 2003-2004. [...] The rebuilt trolley includes the addition of air conditioning and regenerative braking, {{as well as a}} widened center door with a wheelchair lift for ADA compliance.|$|R
