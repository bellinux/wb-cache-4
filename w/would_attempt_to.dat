5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With average returns during its first four weeks, the film eventually became an above-average grosser and its re-release was profitable. It has cult status in Telugu cinema, and is an acclaimed Prasad film. Goldstone Technologies announced that they <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> digitise the film in 2007, but abandoned the attempt three years later.|$|E
5|$|Development of Alien 8 began {{immediately}} {{after the release of}} Knight Lore, in which the Stamper brothers predicted that publishers <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> copy Knight Lore Filmation technology in other games. As with its predecessor, the Stamper brothers developed the game in monochrome to avoid visual overlay and attribute clash, as it was a common processing limitation in early 8-bit consoles. However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{assessed}} the strategic {{situation in the}} Southwest Pacific in late September 1943, {{and concluded that the}} Allies <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> break through the northern Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago in the coming months en route to Japan's inner perimeter in the western and central Pacific. Accordingly, reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in the area in an attempt to slow the Allied advance. Strong forces were retained at Rabaul, however, as it was believed that the Allies <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> capture the town. At the time, Japanese positions in western New Britain were limited to airfields at Cape Gloucester on the island's western tip and several small way stations which provided small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea with shelter from Allied aerial attacks.|$|E

5|$|According to {{his book}} Doctor Who: The Companions (published {{at about the}} time The Trial of a Time Lord was broadcast), series {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's first meeting with Melanie Bush in a later episode. The subsequent dismissal of Colin Baker from {{the role of the}} Doctor rendered this potential storyline moot, although the later novel Business Unusual by Gary Russell, that was published in September 1997, <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> fill in this gap in the show's continuity.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. On this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the aqueduct, safety gates, and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5000|$|The Fortean Times {{was also}} enthusiastic, whilst {{acknowledging}} the difficulties many readers <b>would</b> have <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> follow the convoluted plot threads: ...|$|R

60|$|There was an {{expression}} of deepest thankfulness in the fellow's eyes, and the amateur detective felt reasonably certain that he <b>would</b> not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> make any disturbance.|$|R
5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E
5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands {{to the best}} of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E

5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Dutch <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government {{and its leaders}} moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|He led the {{planning}} for the Battle of Leyte, known as Operation King II, and predicted that the Japanese fleet <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> intervene, striking at the invasion force through the Surigao Strait. His warning that the Japanese fleet would sortie was discounted by MacArthur's chief intelligence officer, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, but Tarbuck put his objection in writing. MacArthur would later commend him for an accurate prediction of {{the course of the}} Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
50|$|Psychological warfare, {{and attacking}} the enemy's psyche was another often {{employed}} tactic of the hashashin, who <b>would</b> sometimes <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> draw their opponents into submission {{rather than risk}} killing them.|$|R
25|$|In 1802 Ranjit Singh, aged 22, took Amritsar {{from the}} Bhangi Sikh misl, paid homage at the Harmandir Sahib temple, which had {{previously}} been attacked and desecrated by the invading Afghan army, and {{announced that he would}} renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.On 1 January 1806, Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British officials of the East India Company, in which he agreed that his Sikh forces <b>would</b> not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> expand south of the Sutlej river, and the Company agreed that it <b>would</b> not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> militarily cross the Sutlej river into the Sikh territory.|$|R
50|$|Grace Autosport is an {{automotive}} racing {{organization that}} was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{compete in the}} open wheel IndyCar Series at the 2016 Indianapolis 500. However, it was ultimately announced that they <b>would</b> not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the race.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to Cam Ranh Bay.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference {{aimed to}} {{establish}} peace between the war's belligerents {{and to establish}} the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{the player}} who was further away from the hole had <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> slice or draw his putt around the {{obstacle}} ball. Sometimes a player <b>would</b> even <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> chip his ball over the opponent's ball into the cup.|$|R
2500|$|The Joint Chiefs of Staff {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} a full-scale attack and invasion {{was the only}} solution. They believed that the Soviets <b>would</b> not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> stop the US from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical: ...|$|R

5|$|On the February 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their {{complaints}} about Lesnar {{not being in}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> break the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four claimants to {{jurisdiction}} over Honduras. González Dávila held royal {{authority over the}} province. Pedrarias claimed jurisdiction by right of the expeditions he had sent under Soto and Hernández de Córdoba. Hernán Cortés claimed jurisdiciton by right of the expedition he had sent under Olid, and Olid himself. A fifth claimant would eventually appear {{in the form of}} the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, which <b>would</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> establish its own direct political control over the province. These rival claimants inevitably produced treachery, conflict, and outright civil war among the Spanish factions.|$|E
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{overhead}} of data transfer across network, the JobTracker <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> enforce data locality when it performs task assignment. When a TaskTraker {{is available for}} task assignment, the JobTracker <b>would</b> first <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> find an unprocessed data block that {{is located on the}} local disk of the TaskTracker. If it cannot find a local data block, the JobTracker <b>would</b> then <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> find a data block that is located on certain node that is on the same rack as the TaskTracker. If it still cannot find a rack-local block, the JobTracker would finally find an unprocessed block that is as close to the TaskTracker as possible based on the topology information on the cluster.|$|R
5000|$|In 1819-20, Blake and Varley {{would often}} meet at Varley's house, and from about 9.00 pm until 5.00 am, {{play a game}} in which Varley <b>would</b> suggest Blake <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> summon the spirit of some {{historical}} or mythological person. On the appearance of the spirit, Blake <b>would</b> then <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> sketch their likeness. These drawings of which many remain, are the [...] "spiritual images" [...] of many very well known people of the past, whom Blake claimed to see in visions that he experienced during these sessions.|$|R
