2500|$|The American retreat did {{not last}} long. [...] Rawdon withdrew most of his forces to Camden, leaving only a company of dragoons at the battlefield. [...] That afternoon, Greene sent Washington and Kirkwood back to Hobkirk's Hill, where they ambushed and drove the dragoons away; Greene turned the army around and reoccupied the site. [...] Colonel Gunby was castigated by Greene for his actions that caused the line to break. [...] A court martial that was {{immediately}} convened found that his [...] "spirit and activity were unexceptionable" [...] but that his order to fall back was [...] "in all probability the only cause <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not obtain a complete victory", [...] without mentioning the failures of Washington and his cavalry's late arrival.|$|E

You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know...you decide." ...|$|E

"As we {{have written}} to you," [...] he said, [...] "the only reason <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not accept the}} manuscripts you sent us was {{that they would have}} {{disappointed}} the high hopes that the public had formed in regard to you.

"For all Mr. Ernescliffe talked as I told you, he was {{so quiet}} and happy, that I made sure he was getting well, but Jennings did not; and there came an old heathen native once to see us, who asked <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not bury him alive, because he got no better, and gave trouble.

6000|$|Mounted on this pony I {{took one}} or two rides along the {{southern}} slopes of the mountain on the old pretext of shooting for the pot. Hans accompanied me on these occasions, but was, I noted, very silent and thoughtful, {{as though he were}} hunting something up and down his tortuous intelligence. Once we got quite near to the mouth of the cave or tunnel where poor Savage had met his horrid end. As we stood studying it a white-robed man whose head was shaved, which made me think he must be a priest, came up and asked me mockingly <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not go through the tunnel and see what lay beyond, adding, almost in the words of Harût himself, that none would attempt to interfere with us as the road was open to any who could travel it. By way of answer I only smiled and put him a few questions about a very beautiful breed of goats with long silky hair, some of which he seemed to be engaged in herding. He replied that these goats were sacred, being the food of [...] "one who dwelt in the Mountain who only ate when the moon changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|From {{this place}} we wandered into what I {{believe to be}} Hyde Park, {{attracted}} by a gigantic figure on horseback, which loomed up in the distance. The effect of this enormous steed and his rider is very grand, seen in the misty atmosphere. I do not understand <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not see St. James's Palace, which is situated, I believe, at the extremity of the same range of mansions of which Stafford House is the opposite end. From the entrance of Hyde Park, {{we seem to have}} gone along Piccadilly, and, making two or three turns, and getting bewildered, I put S----- and the children into a cab, and sent them home. Continuing my wanderings, I went astray among squares of large aristocratic-looking edifices, all apparently new, with no shops among them, some yet unfinished, and the whole seeming like a city built for a colony of gentlefolks, who might be expected to emigrate thither in a body. It was a dreary business to wander there, turning corner after corner, and finding no way of getting into a less stately and more genial region. At last, however, I passed in front of the Queen's Mews, where sentinels were on guard, and where a jolly-looking man, in a splendidly laced scarlet coat and white-topped boots, was lounging at the entrance. He looked like the prince of grooms or coachmen. [...] .|$|E

So everything was settled, and I went to the stable the day before, and told Peter I wanted him to get up very early the next morning, and put old Ripstaver in the buggy, and drive him over to Dr. Hendricks's. I told him he must be there before five o'clock, {{and that he was}} to tie the horse to a maple-tree this side of the front yard. I said one of the doctor's family had to get to the village very early because there were some things to be done before the train came, and it had been agreed we should lend our buggy. Peter was not quite pleased with the arrangement, and asked <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not send the old mare--we only kept two horses; but I said she was too slow, and it had been specially arranged that the buggy, with Ripstaver, should be sent. Peter was a great friend of mine, so he agreed to do what I asked, and said he did not mind walking back.' ('I never would have believed,' said Miss Amanda, 'that the boy had such a mind. If I had only known what he was planning to do! If I had only known! But even if I had, it is so hard to tell what is right.') ...|$|E
