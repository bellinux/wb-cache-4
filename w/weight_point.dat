The contribution of optimal linear multivariable control methods is shown to be major for this first design objective and H 8 synthesis is applied in this paper. The second design objective is that the devices exhibit an adequate dynamical behavior when integrated into the DC network.

To guarantee an easy integration of the subsystems, the device design should be robust to DC network uncertainties.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for handling {{the propagation of}} uncertainty in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In real applications, the pairwise comparisons are usually subject to judgmental errors and are inconsistent and conflicting with each other. Therefore, the <b>weight</b> <b>point</b> estimates provided by the eigenvector method are necessarily approximate. This uncertainty associated with subjective judgmental errors may affect the rank order of decision alternatives. A new stochastic approach is presented to capture the uncertain behavior of the global AHP weights.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of calcination and sulfation in the simultaneous calcination/sulfation of limestone sorbent under circulating fluidized bed boiler conditions was studied. A specially designed constant-temperature reactor which {{can stop the}} reaction {{at a given time}} was employed. When limestone entered the furnace of mixed gases of CO 2, O 2, SO 2, etc., its weight went down first, then up, so there was a minimum <b>weight</b> <b>point.</b> The whole reaction period could be divided into two stages by this minimum <b>weight</b> <b>point,</b> named the weight-loss stage and the weight-growth stage, which were dominated by the calcination reaction and by the sulfation reaction, respectively. In the weight-loss stage, the sulfation reaction took place and CaSO 4 formed simultaneously together with limestone calcination as long as SO 2 was present. In the weight-growth stage, the sulfation ratio at 60 min in simultaneous calcination/sulfation is 30. 7 % higher than that in the sequential calcination then sulfation process. The weight loss rate of limestone calcined in the presence of SO 2 was lower than that without SO 2 present but the final weight was higher. The calcination of limestone was slowed by the presence of SO 2; a probable mechanism was proposed, namely that the CaSO 4 formed may fill or plug the pores in the CaO layer, and impede the transfer of CO 2 and, therefore, retard the calcination reaction. This mechanism was supported by the observation that the effective diffusion coefficient of CO 2 in CaO produced in the presence of SO 2 was reduced. The impeding effect increased with increasing SO 2 concentration (0 – 3000 ppm), while, when the particle size decreased from 0. 4 – 0. 45 mm to 0. 2 – 0. 25 mm, the calcination rate of limestone was higher, no matter whether there was SO 2 present or not. The impeding effect was less pronounced at 880 °C than at 850 °C. The reason for this appears to be {{the fact that there was}} less CaSO 4 formed at 880 °C and, therefore, fewer pores of the particle were filled or plugged...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{intensity}} modulated {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT), {{the number and}} arrangement of beams affects {{the quality of the}} dose distribution produced by the inverse planning process• Beam directions are either selected based on clinical experience, or plans are created based on the minimum number of equidistant beams that gives an acceptable result (typically 5 to 7 beams). Depending on the target location, an optimised beam arrangement can produce a better plan with fewer beams than an equidistant configuration. Materials and methods: We present a simple method for determining the optimal beam arrangement for a fixed number of coplanar beams, and describe how we determine the number of beams to be used in our clinical practice. The method involves a preliminary plan with 18 equidistant coplanar beams, with subsequent plans based on the beams that contributed the most dose after the first optimisation. Using this method we can often prepare 4 or 5 field plans with target coverage, dose homogeneity in the target volume, and normal tissue sparing, that is not significantly degraded compared with the initial 18 field plan. Results: Preliminary 18 beam plans and resulting 4 or 5 beam plans used for treatment are presented and evaluated using different methods. The preliminary investigations used to decide on the method are also presented, including the effect of 20 degrees increments compared with 10 degrees increments for the initial plan, the effect of a 5 degrees rotation of the 18 beams in the initial plan, and the importance of the isocenter and <b>weight</b> <b>point</b> locations. Conclusions: For some treatment sites, class solutions for IMRT treatment planning (that include the beam arrangement) are an effective way to reduce the time needed to find an optimal plan. For other sites - unusual or paediatric cases - the method we present is a useful way to reduce the time required for plan optimisation without significant dose distribution degradation...|$|E
40|$|A dosagem de prolactina é teste de rotina em numerosas condições da prática clínica, e o encontro de hiperprolactinemia pode desencadear outros protocolos diagnósticos mais complexos e custosos. A prolactina é um hormônio bastante heterogêneo e, do ponto de vista de peso {{molecular}}, existem três formas principais em circulação: monômero de 23 kDa, dímero (big prolactin) de 45 kDa e macroprolactina (big-big prolactin) de peso molecular acima de 150 kDa. Em condições normais ou em pacientes com hiperprolactinemia sintomática, predomina em circulação a forma monomérica. A macroprolactina é constituída, na maioria dos casos, por uma associação entre uma molécula de prolactina e uma de IgG, o que leva a uma meia-vida mais longa e atividade biológica menor. O método mais empregado para a pesquisa da existência de quantidades significativas de macroprolactina é o estudo de recuperação pós precipitação do soro com polietilenoglicol (PEG), e a confirmação, quando necessária deve ser feita por cromatografia em coluna de gel filtração. A definição dos valores de corte deve ser feita para cada método, desde que o reconhecimento das formas pode variar entre métodos. A freqüência do encontro de predomínio de macroprolactina em pacientes com hiperprolactinemia referida na literatura varia de acordo com a casuística publicada, mas deve estar na faixa de 25 %. A importância do encontro do fenômeno de predomínio de formas moleculares de alto peso molecular se prende ao fato de que estas formas teriam menor atividade biológica, e estão associadas a casos assintomáticos, ou oligossintomáticos, e a encontro de estudos de imagem normais. Desta maneira, em especial em pacientes cujo quadro clínico não seja característico, a pesquisa de macroprolactinemia é fundamental. Em amostras positivas, estudos adicionais de imagem só devem ser indicados em pacientes com quadro clínico suspeito de hiperprolactinemia patológica. Serum prolactin measurement is {{a routine}} test in several conditions {{in every day}} clinical practice, and the finding of hyperprolactinemia can induce complex and expensive imaging studies. Circulating prolactin is a heterogeneous hormone and, from a molecular <b>weight</b> <b>point</b> of view, there are three main forms: the 23 kDa monomer, the 45 kDa dimer (big prolactin) and the higher than 150 kDa macroprolactin, or big-big prolactin. In normal conditions, or in patients with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the monomeric form is the predominant. Macroprolactin is constituted, {{in the majority of}} cases, by an association of prolactin and IgG that leads to a longer half-life and decreased biological activity. The most commonly employed method to screen for the presence of significant quantities of macroprolactin is the study of recovery after polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, and the confirmation, if necessary, includes gel filtration chromatography. The cut-off values must be defined for each method, since the recognition of the different forms can vary between methods. The frequency of the finding of a predominance of macroprolactin in a patient with hyperprolactinemia varies in the literature, but is most commonly accepted to be around 25 %. The importance of the finding of the phenomenon of predominance of macroprolactin is related to the fact that this molecular form of prolactin is supposed to have lower biological activity, is associated to asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic cases, and normal imaging studies. Consequently, in special in patients with clinical symptoms not characteristic, the screening for macroprolactin is essential. In positive cases, additional imaging studies should only be indicated in patients with clinical symptoms suspect of being a consequence of a pathological hyperprolactinemia...|$|E
