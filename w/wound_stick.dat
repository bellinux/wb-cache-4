40|$|Silica  {{nanoparticles}} are well-known {{to be one}} of the multifunctional {{inorganic compounds}} which are widely used in medical applications. The aim of this study is to prepare the particles of nano silica oxide with particle size ranging from 20 - 25 [*]nm. In the present study, surface modification of Silica nanoparticles was performed, and influence of modification on the structure and morphological properties was investigated. The resulting  nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).  Silica nanoparticles with the average diameter of about 20 nm were modified with oleic acid, as coupling agents, in order to modify their surface properties and make them more waterproof  dispersible in the organic area. Among the results is that the  surface modification of the   Silica nano-particles leads to more dispersion in the organic medium which indicates better organic synthesis.   One of the results obtained, is that modified silica-nanoparticles can be used effectively in environmental and safety applications and can be used in future medical applications as <b>wound</b> <b>stick</b> that prevent water from reaching the wound and then prevent  an inflamatio...|$|E

60|$|The rapid {{development}} of these adherent discs {{is one of the}} most remarkable peculiarities possessed by any tendrils. We have seen that such discs are formed by two species of Bignonia, by Ampelopsis, and, according to Naudin, {37} by the Cucurbitaceous genus Peponopsis adhaerens. In Anguria the lower surface of the tendril, after it has <b>wound</b> round a <b>stick,</b> forms a coarsely cellular layer, which closely fits the wood, but is not adherent; whilst in Hanburya a similar layer is adherent. The growth of these cellular out-growths depends, (except in the case of the Haplolophium and of one species of Ampelopsis,) on the stimulus from contact. It is a singular fact that three families, so widely distinct as the Bignoniaceae, Vitaceae, and Cucurbitaceae, should possess species with tendrils having this remarkable power.|$|R
60|$|The {{lower and}} naked {{part of the}} sub-peduncle (C) is {{likewise}} slightly sensitive to a rub, and I have seen it bent round a stick and even partly round a leaf with which it had come into contact. That the sub-peduncle has the same nature as the corresponding branch of an ordinary tendril, is well shown when it bears only a few flowers; for {{in this case it}} becomes less branched, increases in length, and gains both in sensitiveness and in the power of spontaneous movement. I have twice seen sub-peduncles which bore from thirty to forty flower- buds, and which had become considerably elongated and were completely <b>wound</b> round <b>sticks,</b> exactly like true tendrils. The whole length of another sub-peduncle, bearing only eleven flower-buds, quickly became curved when slightly rubbed; but even this scanty number of flowers rendered the stalk less sensitive than the other branch, that is, the flower-tendril; for the latter after a lighter rub became curved more quickly and in a greater degree. I have seen a sub-peduncle thickly covered with flower-buds, with one of its higher lateral branchlets bearing from some cause only two buds; and this one branchlet had become much elongated and had spontaneously caught hold of an adjoining twig; in fact, it formed a little sub-tendril. The increasing length of the sub-peduncle (C) with the decreasing number of the flower-buds is a good instance of the law of compensation. In accordance with this same principle, the true tendril as a whole is always longer than the flower-stalk; for instance, on the same plant, the longest flower-stalk (measured {{from the base of the}} common peduncle to the tip of the flower-tendril) was 8.5 inches in length, whilst the longest tendril was nearly double this length, namely 16 inches.|$|R

40|$|According to the Ebers papyrus (1550 BC) honey is {{included}} in 147 prescriptions in external applications. Also according to the Smith papyrus (1700 BC) it was used in wound healing: “Thou shouldst bind [the wound] with fresh meat the first day [and] treat afterwards with grease, honey [and] lint every day until he recovers. ” HONEY FOR WOUND HEALING UNDER HOME CONDITIONS Besides scientifically based use of honey in wound care in hospitals (see next section), honey {{can also be used}} under home conditions, as it was used for many centuries. Although sterilised honey is only used in hospitals, raw honey can also be used under home conditions without any risk, as no adverse effects have been reported. Indeed, Prof. Descotte lectured in several Apitherapy conferences that his team has used raw honey routinely for wound care in hundreds of cases in the hospital of Limoge, France. Application of honey for wound healing under home conditions, after 5 It is not necessary to disinfect wound because honey will disinfect it 1. Apply honey as much honey on a gauze or clean cotton cloth as it is necessary to cover wound fully. Gauze and cloth need not be sterile. 2. Abscesses, cavity or deep wounds need more honey to adequately penetrate deep into the wound tissues. The wound bed should be filled with honey before applying the honey dressing pad. 3. Change bandage once a day. When doing it, wound need not be cleaned from honey. Honey is „dissolved “ in the <b>wound</b> or <b>sticks</b> to the gauze. 4. When changing the bandage remove hornification at the border of the wound with a pincette. This can be done under running water or with a soft tooth brush. Cell debris, which were not removed will not disturb healing process. 5. After cleaning, wound should be padded with as much gauze as is needed for drawing the wound liquid. 6.

60|$|The {{explanation}} of this curious little fact is not difficult. I will not attempt any geometrical reasoning, but will give only a practical illustration. In doing this, I shall {{first have to}} allude to a point which was almost passed over when treating of Twining-plants. If we hold in our left hand a bundle of parallel strings, we can with our right hand turn these round and round, thus imitating the revolving movement of a twining plant, and the strings do not become twisted. But if we hold {{at the same time}} a stick in our left hand, in such a position that the strings become spirally turned round it, they will inevitably become twisted. Hence a straight coloured line, painted along the internodes of a twining plant before it has wound round a support, becomes twisted or spiral after it has wound round. I painted a red line on the straight internodes of a Humulus, Mikania, Ceropegia, Convolvulus, and Phaseolus, and saw it become twisted as the plant <b>wound</b> round a <b>stick.</b> It is possible that the stems of some plants by spontaneously turning on their own axes, at the proper rate and in the proper direction, might avoid becoming twisted; but I have seen no such case.|$|R
40|$|John Denis (Jack) Fryer {{was born}} in 1895 at Springsure, Queensland, son of Charles George Fryer and his wife Rosina, née Richards. Charles and Rosina had seven children: Elizabeth Stuart (later Gilmour), William Thomas, Charles George, Henry Hardy, John Denis, Richard Alexander James and Walter Ponsonby. Jack won a {{scholarship}} to the University of Queensland and commenced study in 1915. By the end of first term, Jack decided to volunteer for military service in the first Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned in 1916 and went to France where he was gassed in early 1917. After hospitalisation in England, Jack returned to France for the final push to Amiens, in August 1918. There he was again <b>wounded,</b> by a <b>stick</b> bomb. After the war he re-enrolled at the University of Queensland for the first term of 1920 to complete his English honours examinations. His health failed in 1922 and he died in February 1923. In 1926, as a memorial to their former member and vice-president, members of the University Dramatic Society donated £ 10 to establish a collection of works in Australian literature.

6000|$|When a {{revolving}} shoot strikes a stick, it winds round it rather {{more slowly than}} it revolves. For instance, a shoot of the Ceropegia, revolved in 6 hrs., but took 9 hrs. 30 m. to make one complete spire round a stick; Aristolochia gigas revolved in about 5 hrs., but took 9 hrs. 15 m. to complete its spire. This, I presume, {{is due to the}} continued disturbance of the impelling force by the arrestment of the movement at successive points; and we shall hereafter see that even shaking a plant retards the revolving movement. The terminal internodes of a long, much-inclined, revolving shoot of the Ceropegia, after they had <b>wound</b> round a <b>stick,</b> always slipped up it, so as to render the spire more open than it was at first; and this was probably in part due to the force which caused the revolutions, being now almost freed from the constraint of gravity and allowed to act freely. With the Wistaria, on the other hand, a long horizontal shoot wound itself at first into a very close spire, which remained unchanged; but subsequently, as the shoot twined spirally up its support, it made a much more open spire. With all the many plants which were allowed freely to ascend a support, the terminal internodes made at first a close spire; and this, during windy weather, served to keep the shoots in close contact with their support; but as the penultimate internodes grew in length, they pushed themselves up for a considerable space (ascertained by coloured marks on the shoot and on the support) round the stick, and the spire became more open. {13} ...|$|R
60|$|If a stick {{which has}} arrested a {{revolving}} shoot, {{but has not}} as yet been encircled, be suddenly taken away, the shoot generally springs forward, showing that it was pressing with some force against the stick. After a shoot has <b>wound</b> round a <b>stick,</b> if this be withdrawn, it retains for a time its spiral form; it then straightens itself, and again commences to revolve. The long, much-inclined shoot of the Ceropegia previously alluded to offered some curious peculiarities. The lower and older internodes, which continued to revolve, were incapable, on repeated trials, of twining round a thin stick; showing that, although the power of movement was retained, this was not sufficient to enable the plant to twine. I then moved the stick to a greater distance, {{so that it was}} struck by a point 2.5 inches from the extremity of the penultimate internode; and it was then neatly encircled by this part of the penultimate and by the ultimate internode. After leaving the spirally wound shoot for eleven hours, I quietly withdrew the stick, {{and in the course of}} the day the curled portion straightened itself and recommenced revolving; but the lower and not curled portion of the penultimate internode did not move, a sort of hinge separating the moving and the motionless part of the same internode. After a few days, however, I found that this lower part had likewise recovered its revolving power. These several facts show that the power of movement is not immediately lost in the arrested portion of a revolving shoot; and that after being temporarily lost it can be recovered. When a shoot has remained for a considerable time round a support, it permanently retains its spiral form even when the support is removed.|$|R
40|$|The Zygomycetes {{represent}} relatively uncommon isolates in {{the clinical}} laboratory, reflecting either environmental contaminants or, less commonly, a clinical disease called zygomycosis. There are two orders of Zygomycetes containing organisms that cause human disease, the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. The majority of human illness {{is caused by the}} Mucorales. While disease is most commonly linked to Rhizopus spp., other organisms are also associated with human infection, including Mucor, Rhizomucor, Absidia, Apophysomyces, Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Cokeromyces, and Syncephalastrum spp. Although Mortierella spp. do cause disease in animals, there is no longer sufficient evidence to suggest that they are true human pathogens. The spores from these molds are transmitted by inhalation, via a variety of percutaneous routes, or by ingestion of spores. Human zygomycosis caused by the Mucorales generally occurs in immunocompromised hosts as opportunistic infections. Host risk factors include diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, sustained immunosuppressive therapy, chronic prednisone use, iron chelation therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, severe malnutrition, and primary breakdown in the integrity of the cutaneous barrier such as trauma, surgical <b>wounds,</b> needle <b>sticks,</b> or burns. Zygomycosis occurs only rarely in immunocompetent hosts. The disease manifestations reflect the mode of transmission, with rhinocerebral and pulmonary diseases being the most common manifestations. Cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and allergic diseases are also seen. The Mucorales are associated with angioinvasive disease, often leading to thrombosis, infarction of involved tissues, and tissue destruction mediated by a number of fungal proteases, lipases, and mycotoxins. If the diagnosis is not made early, dissemination often occurs. Therapy, {{if it is to be}} effective, must be started early and requires combinations of antifungal drugs, surgical intervention, and reversal of the underlying risk factors. The Entomophthorales are closely related to the Mucorales on the basis of sexual growth by production of zygospores and by the production of coenocytic hyphae. Despite these similarities, the Entomophthorales and Mucorales have dramatically different gross morphologies, asexual reproductive characteristics, and disease manifestations. In comparison to the floccose aerial mycelium of the Mucorales, the Entomophthorales produce a compact, glabrous mycelium. The asexually produced spores of the Entomophthorales may be passively released or actively expelled into the environment. Human disease with these organisms occurs predominantly in tropical regions, with transmission occurring by implantation of spores via minor trauma such as insect bites or by inhalation of spores into the sinuses. Conidiobolus typically infects mucocutaneous sites to produce sinusitis disease, while Basidiobolus infections occur as subcutaneous mycosis of the trunk and extremities. The Entomophthorales are true pathogens, infecting primarily immunocompetent hosts. They generally do not invade blood vessels and rarely disseminate. Occasional cases of disseminated and angioinvasive disease have recently been described, primarily in immunocompromised patients, suggesting a possible emerging role for this organism as an opportunist...|$|R

Max is forced to separate them and Robert tells Debbie that he doesn't care about her and was only interested in her because of Sarah and wanted to hurt Andy by taking his daughter away. Debbie leaves and returns to the village, heartbroken.|$|R
40|$|We {{travelled}} to the semi rural {{outskirts of}} Srinagar in Kashmir {{to the home}} of Muneer, a kani shawl weaver. In a small room {{on the third floor of}} his house Muneer sat side by side with his friend Hamid at their loom. Each weaver worked pulling small <b>sticks</b> <b>wound</b> in pashmina threads through the weft while carefully referring to a paper tucked under the warp threads on the loom. The woven design on kani shawls is formed by the manipulation of small wooden sticks called tojis that interlock different coloured threads to complete each weft of the shawl. The pashmina threads are used to work the ‘twill tapestry’ pattern. The design plan is on a piece of paper called a talim that is placed beneath the warp in view of the weaver. Each line on the talim consists of numbers and symbols (a shawl alphabet) 1 representing each stage of the weaving: the increase or decrease of colours, or the changes in their places necessary to produce the required patterns and motifs of the design. Muneer learnt the skill of weaving kani shawls from his uncle. Although he has completed a formal school education he prefers to pursue this traditional weaving craft. When we visit Muneer and Hamid they are working together on one shawl but at other times they work on separate shawls. About one inch of a shawl is woven each day and will take a year to complete. A wealthy Indian woman, a collector, has commissioned the kani shawl that Muneer is currently weaving. The skill of weaving kani shawls had almost been lost in Kashmir but due to their increased popularity as a fashion accessory in recent years there’s been a revival in kani weaving from government-supported and private enterprises. In the same locality as Muneer lives Raja with his wife and two young children. We walk through rice fields to his small home where in one room he sits working on his shuttle handloom weaving a pashmina shawl. It takes him up to five days to thread up the loom, the warp in either natural or dyed pashmina threads. Raja weaves around four inches per day and he will make the entire shawl to maintain weaving consistency. Raja was at school during the 1990 s but due the militancy unrest in Kashmir he left and followed his father and grandfather in learning the skills of weaving...|$|R
