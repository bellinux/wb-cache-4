I {{read a lot}} of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up,</b> and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I was raised in a place where pioneer women were very strong still. They'd shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn't really until I've gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of {{his fifth}} studio album in 2016, he stated, [...] "I think <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in America {{has a lot}} of influence.

[...] In {{following}} interviews, Timberlake confirmed working with producers Timbaland, Pharrell Williams, Max Martin and Shellback, while stating, [...] "It sounds more like where I've come from than any other music I've ever made... It's Southern American music. But I want to make it sound modern — at least that's the idea right now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of {{his youth}} <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> {{in a quiet}} rural area, he said that this allowed him to involve himself {{in the pursuit of}} music: But <b>where</b> <b>I</b> {{actually}} <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> was just completely removed from anything resembling a town or a city. It was an hour away from the nearest supermarket. What that granted me was a lot of isolation and when you are bored you tend to work really hard on your interests. I was granted a lot of opportunity to play the guitar, listen to music and read about music. So it probably would have been a different story if <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in a town somewhere.|$|R

Plus, I was looking for the challenge of playing different kinds of music with other bands.”Between 2002 and when he joined Daughtry in 2006, he worked and toured {{with a wide variety of}} other projects including (in no particular order) Kelly Osbourne, Everlast, The Veronica’s, DJ Samantha Ronson, and Ashley Parker Angel as a bassist and/or musical director. He says of that time period..."Every project pushed me in different directions and allowed me to grow musically, but they didn’t give me the creative outlet I really wanted." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing in The Guardian in 2014, Mugisha {{argued that}} {{homophobia}} and the hatred behind the Anti-Homosexuality Bill were from western influences: [...] "I am a gay man.

2500|$|Burton {{said that}} portraying {{a younger age}} (16 at 21) was not a problem, except for one aspect: [...] "My only concern was when I had to put on my cheerleading uniform again.

[...] She said she reread some of her journals {{from high school to}} get [...] "into that place" [...] as a high school student again, and that Peyton being similar to how she was in high school helped. [...] "It also helped that the town where we film, Wilmington, isn’t too different from the hometown <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in Virginia.

2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{released}} on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, and Eminem's newly founded label, Shady Records in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem {{sitting on the porch}} of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, [...] "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. [...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked." ...|$|E

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Textual Practice on 02 / 04 / 2015, available online: [URL] Mantel is a contemporary British writer who has published eleven novels, one memoir and two collections of short stories. A relatively unknown and under-researched author, she shot to fame in 2009 by winning the Booker Prize for her historical novel Wolf Hall – an intelligently sensitive account of Thomas Cromwell’s spectacular rise from black- smith’s son to right-hand man of Henry VIII. I interviewed Mantel at her Devon home in September 2012, just one month prior to her making literary history by winning the Booker Prize {{for a second time}} for her follow-up to Wolf Hall. This staggering achievement made her the first woman to win the prize twice, the first British author to gain a double, with Bring Up the Bodies becoming the first sequel to ever receive the award. She remarked on accepting the prize: ‘Well I don’t know, you wait twenty years for a Booker Prize... Two come along at once!’ A characteristically humorous and self-deprecating response that she qualified by saying she had no expectations of standing at the podium for a third time when the final instalment of her Tudor trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, is published. We pursued an engaging, vivid and wide-ranging conversation in the sitting room of her top floor flat, which overlooks the bay. Mantel and I discussed her roots in the Derbyshire village of Hadfield <b>where</b> <b>I</b> also <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> and <b>where</b> there is now a blue plaque marking her childhood home. In particular, we considered the figure of the ellipsis, since the ambiguities inherent to elliptical thinking seem so to suit the uncertain bases of her writing, as I hope this interview helps to illustrate...|$|R

[...] In another interview, he elaborated further:It's a little bit reflecting on <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from...I <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in really rural area in Northern Montana, and As It Seems" [...] is looking back at that. I think until two or three years ago, I looked back at my childhood as being a fairly utopian situation <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had the freedom to ride my bike around town when I was five years old, and my parents didn't have to worry about anybody taking me and killing me or whatever. In the last couple of years...there have been some things that have kind of allowed some darker things to come to the surface of my childhood, seeing things that I had kind of selectively forgotten for my own mental health or whatever. I had just seen Affliction and I had just read Nine Below Zero by this guy, Kevin Canty, all very kind of rural things that unearthed a lot of stuff. As It Seems" [...] is just kind of what came out. I'm just now starting to actually really analyze what I was talking about...because I still don't really have a grip on that.|$|R
