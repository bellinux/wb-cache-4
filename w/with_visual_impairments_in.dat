40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at looking at the {{relationship}} experiences between the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care and his family. A lack of sufficient guidelines in this field has been identified in the relevant literature. Experts working with these adolescents have confirmed this shortcoming. In order to reach the required goal, a number of objectives were set. By means of a literature study and consultation with {{experts in the field}} of blindness as a symptom (in terms of the degree of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> that is experienced), a theoretical framework was set up with regard to the following: adolescence as part of life; the adolescent's relationship with his family; institutional care and institutionalization; as well as play therapeutic assessment and play therapeutic techniques. An empirical study where semi-structured interviews were used as a method of data collection, was undertaken to assess the relationship of the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care <b>with</b> his family. The following aspects were handled specifically: the way the adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care experience holidays and weekends with their families; their view of their families' perception of them coming home for holidays or weekends; their opinion with regard to family chores and responsibilities that are allocated to them; their experience of participating in the decision making process in the family; their perception of the treatment that they receive from their parents – does it differ in any way from that of their siblings?; their view with regard to “feeling part of” the family as an equal and complete family member; their opinion with regard to things that they would have liked to be done differently during their growing up process; as well as advice that they would give to parents who have children with the same disabilities. Individual semi-structured interviews were used with the ten respondents. Applied research was undertaken as the researcher aimed at establishing solutions for problems that occur with the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care <b>with</b> regard to his relationship with his family. The researcher used a qualitative approach as research procedure in order to get qualitative empirical data. Considering that in this study a relatively unknown field was researched, a phenomenological strategy within an exploratory study was used to explore, understand and interpret the research question, which is not well known. The research question formulated for this study was: What are the experiences of the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care <b>with</b> regard to his relationship with his family? Empirical data, which was obtained by using an interview schedule and a play therapeutic technique, showed that: § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care are experiencing ambivalent feelings (positive and negative) with regard to spending holidays and/or weekends with their families. There are a variety of factors influencing this experience, whether positively or negatively. § The way adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care view their families' perception with regard to them coming home for holidays or weekends, is mainly influenced by three factors, namely: special activities that are organized during the time that the adolescent is at home, as well as verbal and non-verbal behavior that is communicated towards the adolescent. § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have a specific opinion with regard to chores and responsibilities that were allocated to them since they were younger. This includes aspects like the adolescents' willingness and ability to complete chores, as well as their willingness to ask for help. They intimated {{that they are willing to}} accept chores and responsibilities as they experience positive feelings when they are able to complete such tasks successfully. § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care have a specific opinion about their participation in the decision making process in the family. This includes emotions that are experienced with regard to the decision making process (positive emotions are experienced when their opinions are asked in family decisions), their involvement in the decision making process, as well as the influence of decision making on the atmosphere in the house. § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have a fixed perception with regard to the treatment that they receive from their parents. This perception includes the following aspects: a need for normal treatment, the consequences of preference treatment from their parents, strict treatment (overprotective treatment) from their parents, as well as the emotions they experience about the type of treatment that they are exposed to. § The way adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> view themselves as “part of” the family - as equals to all household members - is influenced by the following aspects: the influence of institutionalization on the feeling of “belonging to“ (adolescents are away from home for long periods of time and the only contact they have are telephone calls); family events (special activities in which both the family and the adolescent participate during holidays or weekends); family interaction (the families communicational patterns during holidays or weekends); as well as the private space of the adolescents (bedrooms). § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have a specific opinion with regard to things that they would have liked to be done differently during their process of growing up. They feel that their families should have more insight into the world of people who are visually impaired. They also have the need to be treated in the same way as other family members – they do not want to be overprotected. § Adolescents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> want to give relevant advice to parents of children who have the same disability. The advice that they suggested are: The child must function more independently; parents must be honest with their child at all times; the child must be treated normally; a feeling of unconditional, positive acceptance must be revealed to the child; no unnecessary restriction must be imposed on the child. They also gave advice with regard to general information (to expand parents' knowledge). The study revealed the experience of the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> institutional care of his relationship with his family, which holds further research possibilities. The desired information was acquired and can be used in further studies of the adolescent in a similar situation. Dissertation (MSD (Play Therapy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

The aim is to describe the challenges experienced by visually impaired learners and how they are truly included in the mainstream school curriculum, to analyse the nature of support as well as the adaptation and accommodation made for learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> the mainstream schools. I purposefully selected the participants and used semi-structured interviews; observation method was also used to enhance the information collected during the interviews. A qualitative research approach was followed, underpinned by interpretive method as a paradigm. The participants included in two schools in Dr Kenneth Kaunda District were four teachers teaching learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (two from each school), two parents of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> four learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (two from each school), one specialist (itinerant) teacher designated to assist and support learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> both schools and two principal (one from each school). A total of thirteen participants were involved in this study. The data were audio-recorded for accurate transcription and analysis. From the research it was found that even though the learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are now physically integrated in the mainstream classes, they are not yet truly included. The teachers are not adequately supported and trained and most of the parents of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are not involved in their children’s schooling. The teaching methods and materials are not adequately adapted for them and the physical environment within the classes and school grounds are not yet truly accessible for them. The school needs resources and change in teachers’ attitude; teachers do not understand the rationale behind inclusive education. Finally, the vision and mission statements of the school were drafted but did not provide a clear and practical guideline towards the inclusion of learners <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> I hope that the findings of this study will be of valuable use to both schools in Dr Kenneth Kaunda District and to the Ministry of Basic Education with regard to progress in the inclusion of LVI in the mainstream.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the way general teachers teach students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms {{and the challenges}} facing them. The intention was specifically {{to find out the}} ways general teachers adapt their teaching to make sure that inclusion {{of students with visual impairments}} is appreciated and realized. Furthermore, it intended to uncover the challenges these general teachers face when teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. This study was conducted at one of the secondary school located in southern part of the country. It employed qualitative case study design using four (4) general teachers teaching in classes having students with visual impairments. Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews and participant- observation methods. The findings revealed that general teachers have little knowledge about inclusive education and how it should be practiced not only for students with visual impairments but for all students with special needs. The knowledge about inclusion and teaching in inclusive classrooms is highly needed among general teachers to practice inclusive teaching for students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> a professional manner. Preparation of teaching resources,like audio and tactile materials, reading braille writings, and instructing students with visual impairments the proper ways of using their visual devices, is said to be the role of a special needs teacher. However, it is also advisable for a general teacher to have some of this knowledge in order to counteract the challenges associated with teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, findings showed that, general teachers were not using the little knowledge of teaching in inclusive classrooms they have, due to many challenges surrounding the whole inclusive teaching in secondary schools like scarcity of both general and special needs teachers and lack of commitment among them, scarcity of resource and rigid curriculum. Building from the findings, it is recommended that, the Government should improve the situation of inclusive teaching, such as training teachers in the area of special education to help them conduct their teaching properly. The government should also allocate enough funds to inclusive schools to ensure availability of teaching and learning facilities that will help facilitate teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. Finally, due to the fact that, there are few studies conducted on the area the current study has ventured on, it is recommended that, further studies should be carried out...|$|E

The general objective set for the theoretical part of this bachelor thesis is to map specific features of socialization of older school-aged children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> respect to choice of their future profession. The objective of the practical part was to use qualitative research to reflect the current situation in career consulting for children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> selected school and consulting establishments and to find out about notions that children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future professions and the world of labor. A qualitative method of research, specifically a structured interview technique, was used to meet the objective of the practical part, which was divided into two partial objectives. The interviews were conducted with 6 respondents in total, which included 1 worker of a school establishment, 1 worker of a consulting establishment and 4 schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> aged 13 - 15 years. Questions for the schoolchildren were prepared based on materials used in the theoretical part and they were divided into two sections. The first section of questions concerned basic case history data of the children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their notions about their future profession, while the other section was in form of a didactic test which consisted of questions from the world of labor and its results were supposed to illustrate how well the children understand the world of labor. To meet the other partial objective I have also used a structured interview with a worker of a school establishment and with a teacher with a specific training from a special teaching establishment. The obtained information was processed and it has enabled brief mapping of the current situation in the career consulting for schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> the South Bohemian region. The qualitative research of adequacy of notions that children <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future career has brought quite surprising conclusions. The research has shown that, despite severity of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and the related limitations, the notions of the respondents seemed acceptable and adequate. In respect to career consulting and professional training of those children it is obvious that they are treated in a standard manner and {{in the same way as}} healthy children, that no integrated policy is available for them and that the concerned educational establishment does not take into account specific aspects associated <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|R
