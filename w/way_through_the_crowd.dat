5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 23–24 July there was {{violence}} in the protesting. By the end of July 2013, anti-government protesters were still out in force protesting peacefully in Sofia with Reuters recording 24 July 2013 as the 41st straight day of peaceful protests. The protesters were demanding {{the resignation of the}} Socialist-led government of Oresharski. More than 100 lawmakers, ministers, and journalists spent the night barricaded inside Parliament before police removed them. MPs attempted to leave Parliament by boarding a white coach bus and making their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> There was violence as the police tried to unsuccessfully clear the way for the bus, and after slowly making its way around the Aleksandar Nevski cathedral, the bus returned to the back exit of Parliament after about an hour around midnight. Another police action at around 4 am forcefully cleared the remaining protesters, and the coach left, which led to further accusations of police violence in the ensuing days. A survey covering the attitudes of Bulgarians showed that 65% felt that the actions of the protesters on that day were out of line, while 53% also disapproved of the police response. 79% agreed that the provocateurs involved in the violence need to have charges levelled against them. Sociologists expressed mixed views in relation to the events. One policeman has been charged for unlawful conduct with regard to his actions during the siege of Parliament and is currently on trial for disproportionate use of force against protesters.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E

500|$|Steve Drake, aged 14, was {{the third}} {{juvenile}} {{to be charged with}} the murder. He was named by Mark Pennant and Jason Hill, and was interviewed with his father and a solicitor present. Drake admitted to having taken part in the rioting, but denied involvement in the murder. One witness said during the trial that he had seen Drake force his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> to reach Blakelock, although the testimony was discredited; however Drake spent several years behind bars.|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, {{the goal}} was to produce an album that was [...] "very {{much a part of the}} Dark Carnival, without it being the seventh Joker's Card". Bang! Pow! Boom! was the first album to focus on this concept since Hell's Pit. The album was later {{revealed}} to be the first Joker's Card of a [...] "second deck." [...] Bang! Pow! Boom! is a character within the Dark Carnival which Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell". The album features a series of skits in which rednecks, pedophiles, and husbands who abuse their wives receive phone calls inviting them to the Dark Carnival, where they are promised US$100,000 for arriving.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bang Bang", {{directed}} by Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong, {{was released on}} September 13, 2016. Inspired by the rise in gun violence in the US, it depicts a trio of criminals, wearing face masks of Green Day's members, robbing a bank during the first half. These scenes are intercut with footage of the band performing amidst a house party. During the second verse, the criminals flee the bank and remove their masks, revealing themselves as two women and a man, before driving off in a Jeep Wrangler. The criminals arrive at the house party where Green Day is playing. During the bridge and final chorus, the bank robbers make their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and approach the band, before tossing money from the robbery into the air as the video fades out.|$|E

500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
500|$|Because of past {{association}} with Charles W. Morse and F. Augustus Heinze, on Monday, October 21, {{the board of}} the Knickerbocker asked that Barney resign (depositors may have first begun to pull deposits from the Knickerbocker on October 18, prompting the concern). That day, the National Bank of Commerce where J.P. Morgan was a dominant factor, announced it would not serve as clearing house for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank's opening, the crowd grew. As The New York Times reported, [...] "as fast as a depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking for their money [...] were asked to send some men to keep order". Two van loads of notes were quickly unloaded, yet even this failed to calm the panic stricken depositors. Directors and other officials of the Trust forced their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> assuring them that everyone would be paid. In less than three hours, $8 million was withdrawn from the Knickerbocker. Shortly after noon it was forced to suspend operations.|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Carl {{presents}} [...] "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann {{is played}} by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his chrome-steel chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share a moment on a frozen pond in Central Park until the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto {{the top of the}} Empire State Building, where he fights off six F8C-5 Helldiver Navy planes, downing three. At the end of the confrontation, Kong is mortally wounded by the gunfire and gazes at Ann for the last time before falling from the building to his death. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, photographers, police and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> takes one last long look at Kong and says, [...] "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast." ...|$|E
60|$|Dan {{was evidently}} {{in a high}} state of excitement, for he forced his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> {{regardless}} of possible injury to himself or others, and did not slacken speed until he {{stood in front of}} the cane-board, breathless and panting.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{reminded}} of their duty the young merchants {{set out in}} a body for the Cortlandt Street Ferry, much to the annoyance of those pedestrians against whom they jostled and tumbled in their eagerness to make <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> thoroughfare.|$|R
60|$|The young folks {{piled into}} the cars, which were {{run by the}} Rovers' chauffeurs, {{and in a moment}} more they were picking their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> traffic in <b>the</b> {{direction}} of Fifth Avenue. They speeded up this noted thoroughfare and then across town to Riverside Drive.|$|R
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the crowd around Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E
2500|$|... "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] (or [...] "The Heathen Chinee") {{was very}} popular among general readers. One New York {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} frenzy over the poem: [...] "Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, {{of high and low}} degree, swarming about a shop-window, pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing our <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of Insane Clown Posse's Second Deck (2009), the {{character}} Bang! Pow! Boom!, a new spirit in the Dark Carnival, was introduced. The character is a demon-like figure that Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell". Though the group originally intended to make the character separate from the Six Joker's Cards, he was revealed {{as part of the}} second set of Joker's Cards.|$|E
60|$|In {{many places}} the {{sidewalks}} were littered with boxes {{which had been}} used to sit or stand upon.

25|$|Cummings {{arrived at}} 5:30 pm and walked two laps of the track. George, caught in traffic, arrived shortly before 6:00 pm and climbed over <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with a ladder as {{the risk of}} injury pushing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> was too great.

2500|$|The {{first public}} protest {{after the coup}} {{attracted}} between 20 and 100 protesters in front of Siam Center {{on the evening of}} Friday, 22 September 2006. Nobody was arrested, but police recorded the protest on video and noted that the tape would be examined to determine if protesters broke martial law. [...] It is unknown whether the police or junta will arrest those it had recorded. [...] Demonstrators wore black to mourn the death of democracy, and urged people who opposed the coup to also wear black. Protester Giles Ungphakorn noted, [...] "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak." [...] The protest was not reported on Thai television channels. The Independent reported that when the first protester, a female student, began reading out a statement, armed police forced their <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and grabbed her. A police officer jabbed a gun into her stomach and told her: [...] "You're coming with us." [...] The protesters tried to hold the woman back, but her fate is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{intended}} as a nonsense song for children, [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] received various social and political interpretations at the time; music journalist Peter Doggett wrote that the [...] "culturally empty" [...] song [...] "became a kind of Rorschach test for radical minds." [...] The song's chorus was reappropriated by schoolchildren, sports fans, and striking workers in their own chants. At a Mobe protest in San Francisco, a yellow papier-mâché submarine made its <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which Time magazine interpreted as a [...] "symbol of the psychedelic set's desire for escape". A reviewer for the P.O. Frisco wrote in 1966, [...] "the Yellow Submarine may suggest, {{in the context of}} the Beatles' anti-Vietnam War statement in Tokyo this year, that the society over which Old Glory floats is as isolated and morally irresponsible as a nuclear submarine." [...] Writing for Esquire, Robert Christgau felt that the Beatles [...] "want their meanings to be absorbed on an instinctual level" [...] and wrote of the interpretations, [...] "I can't believe that the Beatles indulge in the simplistic kind of symbolism that turns a yellow submarine into a Nembutal or a banana—it is just a yellow submarine, damn it, an obvious elaboration of John 's submarine fixation, first revealed in A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1871, Tryon was {{appointed}} private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Goschen. The appointment normally {{went to an}} experienced captain with ten years' service, whereas Tryon had yet to serve at sea in that rank. The post carried considerable influence, equivalent in practice {{to that of other}} Lords of the Admiralty, in advising upon naval appointments. Goschen said of Tryon, [...] "I had an immensely high opinion not only of his naval knowledge, but of his general savoir faire, rapidity of judgement, decision, extraordinary shrewdness, and great knowledge of men. He was somewhat cynical in his views of human nature but his cynicism was of a good humoured and harmless cast." [...] A story was related of the Admiralty board travelling to Dover to meet the Shah of Persia in 1872. At the railway station it was found they would have to walk some distance through a large crowd. Tryon commented to a friend that he would get one of the admirals to carry his bag for him, which he duly did by asking the admiral to hold his bag while he opened a <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Tryon then avoided reclaiming his luggage until they reached their destination.|$|E
2500|$|In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle {{declared}} that [...] "Oklahoma! really is different – beautifully different. With {{the songs that}} Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! {{seems to me to}} be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that [...] "Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet , is actually the biggest hit of the show. The [...] "Out of My Dreams" [...] and [...] "All Er Nuthin'" [...] dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world." [...] In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that [...] "Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical," [...] as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. [...] "It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B." [...] Lorenz Hart himself [...] "pushed his <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear.
