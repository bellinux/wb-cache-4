5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E

500|$|Coalescence {{occurs when}} <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> fuse to create larger <b>water</b> <b>droplets.</b> Air {{resistance}} typically causes the <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> {{in a cloud}} to remain stationary.

50|$|Coalescence {{occurs when}} <b>water</b> <b>{{droplets}}</b> fuse to create larger <b>water</b> <b>droplets,</b> or when <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> freeze onto an ice crystal, {{which is known}} as the Bergeron process. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops. When air turbulence occurs, <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.|$|R

25|$|Another method {{good for}} biomolecules is Matrix {{assisted}} laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI). In this technique, it utilizes Infrared laser ionization to excite the sample molecules {{to allow for}} the desorbed ions to be ready for MS analysis. The geometry of the source and the distance between the ESI and matrix will have and effect on the efficiency of the sample compound. This technique can also be used with aqueous samples as well. The <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> can be placed at {{the focal point of the}} laser, or the droplet can be dried to form the solid. Planar samples do not need sample preparation to perform this experiment.|$|E

30|$|For comparison, {{we provide}} a {{microscopic}} image of CNTs/Si exposed under nebulizer fogs in Figure  3 d. It {{is not easy}} for <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> to slide on the CNTs/Si surface due to large SA. Some <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> sprayed into CNTs/Si disperse into the cavities of the CNT forest, making the wetting surface of the CNTs and some tiny <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> gather into large drops. The large <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> on the CNTs/Si surface deform into irregular shapes due to wetting, which are quite different from those on the CNTs/Si-μp. The <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> we observed on the CNTs/Si surface have a diameter above 5 mm (approximately 52 μL).|$|R

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E

Al-Farisi also [...] "proposed a model where the ray of light from the sun was refracted twice by a <b>water</b> <b>droplet,</b> one or more reflections occurring between the two refractions."

50|$|One {{piezoelectric}} generator {{being developed}} uses water droplets {{at the end}} of a piezoelectric cantilever beam. The water droplets hang from the end of the beam and are subjected to excitation by the kinetic energy of the vibrations. This results in the <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> oscillating, which in turn causes the beam they are hanging from to deflect up and down. This deflection is the strain which is converted to energy through the piezoelectric effect. A major advantage to this method is that it can be tailored towards a wide range of excitation frequencies. The natural frequency of the <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> is a function of its size; therefore changing the size of the <b>water</b> <b>droplet</b> allows for the matching of the natural frequency of the droplet and the frequency of the pressure wave being converted into electrical energy. Matching these frequencies produces the largest amplitude oscillation of the <b>water</b> <b>droplet,</b> resulting in a large force and larger strain on the piezoelectric beam.|$|E

40|$|Digital microfluidics: an {{easy way}} to {{encapsulate}} successively <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> by oil. Digital microfluidics is implemented to coat successively <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> with a thin layer of silicon oil. Small <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> are settled at three fibers nodes while a larger oil drop slides down the vertical fiber. Optofluidics: an interesting way to reveal the droplet sliding motion and the encapsulation. To distinguish the different fluids, quantum dots (QDs) and rhodamine labelled polystyrene beads are diluted in oil and water, respectively. These two fluorescent probes are lighted by a 532 nm radiation. The fluorescence signal is recorded by a high speed camera, perpendicularly to the laser and to the fibers network. This set-up reveals that the oil drop passes through the <b>water</b> <b>droplets</b> without removing them from the nodes, leaving a thin oil layer around the <b>water</b> <b>droplets.</b> The coating, clearly seen on top pictures of Fig 2, prevents water evaporation. The key parameters for a good encapsulation are the fiber diameter and the oil viscosity that determine droplets size and velocity, respectively...|$|R
