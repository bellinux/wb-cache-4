5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the problems of}} capacity, the National Stadium <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting.

5|$|Alderson enjoyed {{an active}} retirement, {{becoming}} Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with fervour, being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt {{and member of}} the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. After living the last few years of his life on a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, he died in December 1927 of a sudden heart attack at Lowestoft and was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire, survived by his wife. She later arranged for his private papers to be given to the nation and they are currently stored at British Library and the National Archives of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} in driving off the French, who retired {{in the face of}} his superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On the way to the Portuguese Coast, Balchen finally made his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a battered and leaking condition until, a few days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|M Squadron {{also had}} a 3-month tour in early 2003.

The SBS <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> active as part of Task Force Black, C squadron deployed to Baghdad as part of the task force in 2004, in its four-month deployment it mounted 22 raids. On 23 July 2005, M squadron, supported by troops from the SAS and US forces carried out Operation Marlborough, killing 3 members of AQI.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E

5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E
5|$|Sidney Weinberg, {{who rose}} from the job of {{assistant}} porter to head Goldman Sachs from 1930 to 1969, was married at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1920. The Weinberg family, which had joined the synagogue {{when it was still}} on Beorum Place, <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> active in the synagogue; Sidney's mother, Sophie, was sisterhood president from 1912 to 1913, and his father, Pincus, served as president from 1919 to 1921, and the children all attended the Sunday school and Talmud Torah. The Weinbergs subsequently moved to Flatbush, where in 1924 Pincus became the first president of the East Midwood Jewish Center.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{graduated}} in chemical {{engineering at the}} University of Karlsruhe, and received his Ph.D. in physics under Werner Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig. Teller's dissertation dealt {{with one of the}} first accurate quantum mechanical treatments of the hydrogen molecular ion. In 1930 he befriended Russian physicists George Gamow and Lev Landau. Teller's lifelong friendship with a Czech physicist, George Placzek, <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> important for his scientific and philosophical development. It was Placzek who arranged a summer stay in Rome with Enrico Fermi in 1932, thus orienting Teller's scientific career in nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly {{in front of the other}} and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's average {{attendance}} at Malmö Stadion initially lay steady at around 15,000 per season from the mid-1960s {{to the early}} 1970s, before decreasing to around 10,000 spectators per season {{for the remainder of}} that decades. During the 1980s and the 1990s, attendances decreased even further down to an average of around 5,000 fans per season; the general interest in Swedish football <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> low at the time. Attendance took a sharp turn upwards during the 2001 season, Malmö FF's first season back in Allsvenskan after a season in Superettan. Average crowds then increased annually, and reached their peak during the 2004 season, when Malmö FF reached an all-time record average attendance of 20,061. Attendances afterwards decreased each year, and were down to a seasonal average of 11,182 by the time of Malmö FF's final season at the ground. Only 6,580 attended Malmö FF's last Allsvenskan match at the stadium, on 9 November 2008.|$|E
5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E
