25|$|In 1836, Carson met an Arapaho {{woman named}} Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing) at a {{mountain}} man rendezvous held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> young woman, and many mountain {{men were in}} love with her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet singed his hair. The duel {{was one of the best}} known stories about Carson in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1958-59 the MCC {{had insisted}} on fewer upcountry matches, on this tour they were {{increased}} {{and as a result}} New South Wales lost its return match with the tourists, though Sydney did get two Tests. The Victoria Park Oval <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> ground, surrounded by bowling greens, croquet lawns, cricket and football fields, public parks and a zoo. The Country XI were overawed by Fred Trueman (4/45) in the first innings, with Len Coldwell taking 3/25 and David Allen 3/34 helping him dismiss them for 138. John Murray was wicket-keeping again after his injury in the Third Test and showed no ill effects. The MCC made 451/8 in return with David Sheppard (93) and captain Colin Cowdrey (97) added 151 before both getting out within minutes of stumps in the 98 degree heat. Graveney making the fastest century of the tour, 106 in 81 minutes and hit four sixes and Barry Knight hit a powerful 70. The Country XI survived the day to earn a draw even though Allen took 3/51, they made 227/5 thanks to the 24-year-old chemist Ian Drake. Drake was 'run out' on 59 when he hit the ball to the fence and Umpire Clare signalled a boundary, but Ray Illingworth picked it up a foot inside and threw it to Murray, who broke the wicket and Umpire Miller gave him out. Cowdrey called him back to continue the innings and he made 101, the first century by a Country player against the MCC since the war.|$|E

She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all ..." [...] and the latter [...] "Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia". Ono also issued a statement, emphasizing the position she held in common: [...] "Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy. Cynthia and I understood each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future." [...] Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, who had spent considerable time with her and John in the 1960s while researching his book, remembered her as [...] "a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet, reserved and calm." ...|$|E

500|$|Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman {{shortly after}} Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's {{acquisition}} of the Beatles songs {{and the impact of}} it on their relationship:And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for a}} raise. Well you would, you know. [...] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, [...] "That's just business Paul." [...] You know. So, [...] "yeah it is", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> man, massively talented, and we miss him.|$|E
500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely,</b> bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E

2500|$|Magennis has {{had several}} {{memorials}} erected in his honour. When Magennis first won the VC, {{he was treated}} rather shabbily by the Unionist-dominated Belfast City Council because he was from a working class Roman Catholic family. Although the public collected £3,600 in appreciation of his heroism, the council refused {{to give him the}} freedom of the city. The only official recognition was a small photograph tucked away in the robing room of the council chamber. The first memorial was only erected in 1999 after a long campaign by his biographer George Fleming and Major S.H. Pollock CD (Canada). The memorial, a bronze and stone statue, was officially unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis's son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker. Magennis's former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: [...] "Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> man and a fine diver. I have never met a braver man. It was a privilege to know him and it's wonderful to see Belfast honour him at last." [...] A wall mural commemorating James Magennis on the 60th anniversary of VJ day was unveiled on 16 September 2005 by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament representing East Belfast, including Tullycarnet.|$|E
