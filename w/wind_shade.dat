40|$|This {{research}} proposes {{an efficient}} reliability {{modeling and simulation}} methodology in power systems to include photovoltaic units, wind farms and storage. Energy losses by wake effect in a wind farm are incorporated. Using the wake model, <b>wind</b> <b>shade,</b> shear effect and wind direction are also reflected. For solar modules with titled surface, more accurate hourly photovoltaic power in a specific location is calculated with the physical specifications. There exists {{a certain level of}} correlation between renewable energy and load. This work uses clustering algorithms to consider those correlated variables. Different approaches are presented and applied to the composite power system, and compared with different scenarios using reliability analysis and simulation. To verify the results, reliability indices are compared with those from original data. As the penetration of renewables increases, the reliability issues will become more important because of the intermittent and non-dispatchable nature of these sources of power. Storage can provide the ability to regulate these fluctuations. The use of storage is investigated in this research. To determine the operating states and transition times of all turbines, Monte Carlo is used for system simulation in the thesis. A conventional power system from IEEE Reliability Test Systems is used with transmission line capacity, and wind and solar data are from National Climatic Data Center and National Renewal Energy Laboratory. The results show that the proposed technique is effective and efficient in practical applications for reliability analysis...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean southwestern Australia {{experienced}} two successive days {{of extreme}} (> 45 deg C) maximum temperatures and hot winds {{during the summer}} of 1991, resulting in adult mortality and extensive crown damage in a sclerophyllous mallee-heathland. To investigate the relationship between leaf attributes, plant environment, and heat tolerance in sclerophylls, measurements of plant height, leaf clustering, leaf morphology (thickness, dry density, area, perimeter/area ratio), percentage crown damage, and percentage mortality, and categories of exposure to <b>wind,</b> <b>shade,</b> and bare soils were recorded for 40 heat-damaged and 14 undamaged co-occurring species. Analyzing the entire dataset by principal components analysis showed that undamaged species had thicker leaves (on average 61 % thicker) than species with damaged leave and were more exposed to wind, sun, and bare soil. Thicker leaves are a common respone to hot, dry, and more exposed environments and are more heat tolerant than thinner leaves. A separate analysis of the Proteaceae (25 damaged and six undamaged species) showed a similar trend to the overall dataset. An analysis of the Myrtaceae (10 damaged and three undamaged species) showed that wind exposure and level of shading were the most important variables influencing the degree of leaf damage. Percentage leaf damage was significantly correlated with percentage adult mortality, but not with the ability of a species to regrow (percentage of plants producing new shoots). Differences between undamaged and damaged species may be a result of preconditioning, whereby species growing in more exposed habitats were pre-adapted to tolerate periods of heat stress. It is unlikely that the study species were able to reduce leaf temperatures via transpirational cooling during the hottest part of the 2 -d heatwave. The ability of a species to tolerate extreme temperature events will be determined by the interaction between leaf heat loads, leaf heat-storing capacity, and the degree of exposure to environmental elements...|$|E

40|$|Estimating annual optical {{performance}} of heliostats under realistic load is computationally very expensive as complex structural deformation and ray tracing calculations are necessary. An approach is presented that vastly accelerates these calculations by using pre-calculated multidimensional maps {{derived from a}} limited number of precisely computed grid points through linear interpolation. Structural maps represent mirror misalignment as a function of wind velocity, direction and gravity. Power maps contain the intercepted power of a heliostat given its position in the field, mirror misalignment and the current sun position. The maps are generated based on specific assumptions about the tower and receiver dimensions as well as heliostat dimensions and on simple experimental investigations as for the drive properties. An estimation of the annual energy yield is obtained by integrating current intercepted power values chronologically for a given heliostat field configuration. For this purpose, representative time series for weather data (direct normal insolation, wind velocity and direction) are generated artificially. The misalignment of mirrors is calculated from wind loads taking into account <b>wind</b> <b>shading</b> effects. By applying this method to different drive configurations, the impact on the annual yield under wind loads can be rapidly identified. Thus, the method allows easy assessment of drive and other component modifications and therefore can be helpful in reducing specific costs. Results of this method are presented, using a specific heliostat design as reference. A drive train with typical stiffness properties is compared to an ideally stiff one. It is found that the method works in that it provides plausible results within reasonable computing time. Future extensions of the tool to include backlash and other drive effects are briefly described...|$|R

The British government recognised its inadequacy as a home for the former Emperor and his entourage and, by the time of his death, had built a new house for him nearby, which he never occupied. In February 1818, Governor Sir Hudson Lowe proposed to Lord Bathurst to move Napoleon to Rosemary Hall, a house that became available and was located in a more hospitable part of the island, sheltered from the <b>winds</b> and <b>shaded,</b> as Napoleon had preferred. But the revelations of General Gourgaud in London brought Lord Bathurst to the opinion that it was safer to keep Napoleon at Longwood, where an escape was harder to undertake. The building of the new house only began in October 1818, three years after Napoleon's arrival on the island.|$|R

Ata's house stood about eight {{kilometres}} from the road that runs round the island, and you went to it along a <b>winding</b> pathway <b>shaded</b> by the luxuriant trees of the tropics. It was a bungalow of unpainted wood, consisting of two small rooms, and outside was a small shed that served as a kitchen. There was no furniture except the mats they used as beds, and a rocking-chair, which stood on the verandah. Bananas with their great ragged leaves, like the tattered habiliments of an empress in adversity, grew close up to the house. There was a tree just behind which bore alligator pears, and all about were the cocoa-nuts which gave the land its revenue. Ata's father had planted crotons round his property, and they grew in coloured profusion, gay and brilliant; they fenced the land with flame. A mango grew in front of the house, and {{at the edge of the}} clearing were two flamboyants, twin trees, that challenged the gold of the cocoa-nuts with their scarlet flowers.|$|R

Typical flexible structures exposed to the action of <b>wind</b> are <b>shading</b> devices, normally slats or louvers. A typical cross-section for such elements is a Z-shaped profile, made out of a central web and two-side wings. Galloping instabilities are often determined in practice using the Glauert-Den Hartog criterion. This criterion relies on accurate predictions of the dependence of the aerodynamic force coefficients with the angle of attack. The results of a parametric analysis based on a numerical analysis and performed on different Z-shaped louvers to determine translational galloping instability regions are presented in this paper. These numerical analysis results have been validated with a parametric analysis of Z-shaped profiles based on static wind tunnel tests. In order to perform this validation, the DLR TAU Code, which is a standard code within the European aeronautical industry, has been used. This study highlights the focus on the numerical prediction of the effect of galloping, which is shown in a visible way, through stability maps.
