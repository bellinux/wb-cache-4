500|$|According to Variety magazine, {{the script}} for Hannibal was: [...] "quite {{faithful}} to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, {{as well as the}} considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake)." [...] Time Out noted: [...] "The <b>weight-watchers</b> script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{common theme}} {{emerging}} {{from a variety of}} theoretical approaches to the problem of exercise adherence concerns the role of individuals ' reasons for exercising (participation motives) in determining long-term adherence to regular physical activity. The EMI (Markland and Hardy, 1993) was developed as a means of assessing participation motives in order to examine such issues as the influence of motives on exercise participation, how such motives might influence the choice of activities undertaken, how affective responses to exercising may be influenced by reasons for exercising and how involvement in physical activity might have a reciprocal influence on participation motives. In particular, the authors developed the instrument to examine questions concerning the functional significance of exercise motives from the perspective of Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-determination theory. The development and initial assessment of {{the reliability and validity of}} the EMI are described in Markland & Hardy (1993). The EMI subscales have been found to discriminate between women taking part in community aerobics classes and members of a <b>Weight-Watchers</b> group taking part in aerobics as part of the weight reduction programme (Markland, Ingledew, Hardy and Grant, 1992). In an interesting study by Ingledew, Hardy and de Sousa (1995) EMI weight management scores were differentially predicted amongst males and females by body mass index and body shape dissatisfaction. Markland (1999), in a test of the self-determination theory prediction that motives could be experienced as internally controlling or internally informational, found that exercise motives as measured by the EMI differentiall...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} the <b>Weight-Watcher</b> service. This service aims at providing resource consumption measurements and estimations for software executing on resourceconstrained devices. By using the <b>Weight-Watcher,</b> software components can continuously adapt and optimize {{their quality of}} service with respect to resource availability. The interface of the service is composed of a Profiler and a Predictor. We present an implementation that is lightweight in terms of CPU and memory. We also performed various experiments that convey (a) the tradeoff between the memory consumption of the service and {{the accuracy of the}} prediction, as well as (b) a maximum overhead of 10 % on the execution speed of the VM for the Profiler to provide accurate measurements.
