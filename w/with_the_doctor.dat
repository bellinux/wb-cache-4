5|$|At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor are {{standing}} in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E

5|$|A year passes, with Amy and Rory {{periodically}} travelling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> Brian, after observing Amy and Rory {{returning from}} one trip, asks the Doctor {{what has happened}} to his past companions. The Doctor tells some had met a sad fate but he will not let that happen to Amy or Rory. Humanity forgets about the cubes, using them as paperweights or other functions.|$|E
5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} at the hospital with Bailey and Zola, Grey is informed by the surgeons that they tried everything to save her husband's life. Grey points out {{that they should have}} ordered a head CT, much to Blake's dismay. She reviews all of her options <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> in-charge of Shepherd's case, before signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to his hospital room to say a final goodbye to Shepherd. This is accompanied by a montage of the happy moments from their relationship.|$|E

The caves were used again for Doctor Who in The End of Time (2009), including a scene <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> sharing thoughts and visions with the Ood.|$|E
5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers {{were left to}} his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

50|$|A fourth {{series of}} stories was {{released}} in 2013, featuring one story <b>with</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Doctor,</b> two <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Doctor</b> and one <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Third <b>Doctor,</b> featuring <b>the</b> first Third <b>Doctor</b> lost story ever released. The series was released September-December 2013, and the first three stories are connected because they were all originally by Brian Hayles.|$|R
5|$|During {{spare time}} in filming, Tom Baker and Ian Marter (who played Harry Sullivan {{in the series}} and later novelised several Doctor Who scripts for Target Books) wrote a script for a Doctor Who film, Doctor Who meets Scratchman. The script, {{sometimes}} titled Doctor Who and the Big Game, saw the Doctor encounter the Daleks, meet the Devil known as Harry Scratch or Scratchman, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones, the Greek god Pan, and at times Vincent Price and Twiggy {{were associated with the}} production to play as the villain Harry Scratch and a possible new female companion after Elisabeth Sladen left the TV series. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> Harry and Sarah dodging balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. During his tenure as the Fourth Doctor, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the first}} in a trilogy of stories that {{continues}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sixth <b>Doctor</b> in <b>The</b> Acheron Pulse and concludes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Seventh <b>Doctor</b> in <b>The</b> Shadow Heart.|$|R
5|$|In the series' narrative, Rose is {{introduced}} in the eponymous series one premiere as a teenage working class shop assistant from London, alongside her own supporting cast {{in the form of}} her mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course of the first series Rose's human actions and responses contrast with the Doctor's alien perspectives. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose forms a similar bond with the new Doctor, but the two appear to be forever separated in the series two finale, although Rose's temporary return in the fourth series gives her relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> a resolution.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the second}} in a trilogy of stories that began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fifth <b>Doctor</b> in <b>The</b> Burning Prince and concludes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Seventh <b>Doctor</b> in <b>The</b> Shadow Heart.|$|R
5000|$|Another 'sympathetic' {{role was}} in 2013, {{when he played}} Professor Grisenko in <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who episode [...] "Cold War" [...] in which he battled a revived Ice Warrior and struck up a rapport <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> {{companion}} Clara Oswald.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Miles {{appeared}} in Doctor Who on television <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Third <b>Doctor</b> in <b>The</b> Silurians (1970) and Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1973), and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fourth <b>Doctor</b> in Genesis of the Daleks (1975) (as Security Commander Nyder, Davros's second in command).

5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The Dream Lord keeps Amy {{awake in}} the TARDIS reality while the Doctor and Rory fall asleep {{and return to the}} Leadworth reality. The Dream Lord {{questions}} Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor. He states that she must choose between the worlds; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. As Amy believes she is going into labour, Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house, leading to their assumed deaths. The three wake up again on the TARDIS where they are congratulated by the Dream Lord, who then reactivates the TARDIS. After the Dream Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct, apparently killing them all.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> and Donna {{exploring}} a marketplace on the Asian styled planet Shan Shen. Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was driving along with her mother, Sylvia, through London {{to get a new}} job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to turn left to get to the security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to turn right this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, Steven Moffat {{endorsed}} the fan theory that Goronwy is a future incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> {{and said that}} the idea fit well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> line about retiring to become a beekeeper in [...] "The Name of the Doctor".|$|R
