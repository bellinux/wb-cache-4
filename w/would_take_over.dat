He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began {{penetrating}} into medieval Armenia and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, starting the Turkification process in the area; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. Alongside the Turkification of the territory, the culturally Persianized Seljuks set the basis for a Turko-Persian principal culture in Anatolia, which their eventual successors, the Ottomans, <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{made one}} final attempt {{to call off}} the assault. After his {{encounter}} with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Porter and was informed that Porter did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Porter to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.|$|E

5|$|Overall, the Dartmouth {{football}} program went 23–23–2 in Wurtenburg's {{five years of}} coaching. The 1898 season was the final Triangular Football League championship the school would win; the conference would become defunct in 1901, two years later. Following Wurtenburg's departure, Frederick E. Jennings, a player under Wurtenburg, <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the program, leading it to a 2–4–2 record in one year of coaching. Another former player, Walter McCornack would coach the program starting in 1901, and led the team to a 15-win record in two years. Wurtenburg's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked {{as the beginning of}} Dartmouth's acceptance as a major team.|$|E

5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion of the route to Newmarket in 1989; it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of the route to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} records, the first spaniel {{was brought to}} North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and {{is now known as}} the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E
