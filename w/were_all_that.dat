5|$|During {{this period}} Pixar {{continued}} its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become {{its most important}} partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced {{the total number of}} employees to just 42, essentially its original number. Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remained of Pixar.|$|E
5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search {{team from the}} surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat Tsugaru, had met a six-man Soviet delegation at the port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired footwear. With footwear that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men's, women's and children's dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> they had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were craft {{that had no}} ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down gangways. That they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, but they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since {{that had not been}} done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they veered off to the left, adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and make better landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{many of the}} walking {{sessions}} had to be cancelled {{due to lack of}} interest. The staff noticed that whereas in earlier years luggage was hauled by hand-cart, taxis <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> were used by this time. In the summer of 1986, Swiss law changed and banned underground oil tanks, which Our Chalet had. In 1988 Our Chalet had saved the funds to move the tanks to a new cellar under the kitchen porch.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s {{the many}} dirt roads and cobbled roads were crucial {{sites in the}} race. Historian Tom Van Laere states that the Tour of Flanders had never set out to use poor roads– cobblestoned roads <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> were {{available}} if the race were to be long enough. In the Interwar period, Belgium's infrastructure was severely scarred by war and only the intercity roads were smooth. Roads were laid in cobblestones, simply {{because it was the}} cheapest material at the time. After the Second World War, Belgium picked itself up from devastation and provinces began asphalting roads.|$|E

25|$|The major rivers on {{the east}} coast were also {{explored}} in case they could lead to a transcontinental passage. Jacques Cartier's explorations of the Saint Lawrence River were initiated in hope of finding a way through the continent. Cartier became persuaded that the St. Lawrence was the Passage; when he found the way blocked by rapids at what is now Montreal, he was so certain that these rapids <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was keeping him from China (in French, la Chine), that he named the rapids for China. To this day, they are known as the Lachine Rapids.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the guns, all major {{resistance}} in Cassinga ended. The odd sniper and corners of light resistance <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished. The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid-Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured. Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically. In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed. It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned.|$|E

25|$|The French {{remained}} at anchor {{in front of}} Muros when the fleet of the Marquis of Viso came over to them at full speed. He only had 16 ships, which <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he could enlist and equip, but were, apparently, the largest available at the time, giving him a certain advantage over the 25 French ships. As it was 25 July, the Festivity of St. James, Patrón de España, Bazán harangued his troops {{by pointing out that}} it was impossible for the Spanish to lose a battle on this particular day. The Spanish troops attacked with such a raging fervour, that the French, were overwhelmed in a short time.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{among the}} {{seasonal}} waterways are Riacho Melância watershed 30km south of Curaçá, where the last known wild Spix's macaw nest was located, adjacent Riacho Barra Grande, and Riacho da Vargem ~100km {{to the north}} near Abaré all in the State of Bahia south of Rio São Francisco. In 1990, these <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remained {{of what was once}} believed to be a vast filigree of creekside Caraibeira woodland extending 50km into the Caatinga {{on either side of the}} Rio São Francisco along a significant stretch of its middle reaches.

25|$|On {{the deck}} of a typical trireme in the Peloponnesian War there were 4 or 5 archers and 10 or so marines. These few troops were {{peripherally}} effective in an offensive sense, but critical in providing defense for the oarsmen. Should the crew of another trireme board, the marines <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> stood between the enemy troops and the slaughter of the men below. It has also been recorded that if a battle were to take place in the calmer water of a harbor, oarsmen would join the offensive and throw stones (from a stockpile aboard) to aid the marines in harassing/attacking other ships.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad's son Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu {{returned}} to Iran in c. 1224 after his exile in India. The rival Turkic states, which <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remained of his father's empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol {{attempt to take}} Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by Chormaqan's army sent by the Great Khan Ögedei in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, Azerbaijan and the southern Persian dynasties in Fars and Kerman voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute. To the west, Hamadan {{and the rest of}} Persia was secured by Chormaqan. The Mongols invaded Armenia and Georgia in 1234 or 1236, completing the conquest of the Kingdom of Georgia in 1238. They began to attack the western parts of Greater Armenia, which was under the Seljuks, the following year.|$|E
25|$|There {{were greater}} delays at Mike sector; the guns of B Trp landed at 16.15 {{and went into}} action on the beach because the dunes and {{approaches}} were mined. Their crews helped to rescue men from burning landing craft {{at the edge of}} the water. A Troop's guns were in the process of landing at 19.00 when they engaged a Junkers Ju 88 attacking the landing craft – the only daylight attack on Juno during D-Day. RHQ reported 24 Bofors and 12 x 20mm of 'O' AA Assault Group ashore by 19.00. In the absence of HAA guns and their radar or of searchlights, which had been unable to land, uncontrolled barrages by the LAA guns <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was possible during the night, but no concentrated attack occurred. Additional Troops of 114th LAA Rgt landed on D+1 as air attacks began to increase, peaking on D+3.|$|E
25|$|The second Campbell County {{victim was}} found on April 3, 1985, but her hair color is unknown, which does not {{immediately}} indicate she {{was a victim of}} the Redhead Murderer. She was believed to have died between 1981 and 1984, one to four years before. Unlike the other victims, she was younger, between 9 and 15, when the others were estimated to be over 16. She was located by a passerby about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico in Campbell County, some distance from interstate 75, near a strip mine. The cause of this girl's death is unknown, as her remains were partial, but still may be homicide. Thirty-two bones, including her skull, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> were recovered from the scene. Her skull allowed facial reconstruction. She wore a necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons from clothing. There were a pair of boots recovered that were size 5, which may not belong to the victim, and a few scraps of clothing. Due to the condition of her body, her height, weight, eye color and hair color were not possible to estimate.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{regarded}} as of Purépecha origin, contemporary with the Aztecs, {{it became apparent}} {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, as a result of further research, that the artifacts and tombs were instead over 1000 years older. [...] Until recently, the looted artifacts <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was known of the people and culture or cultures that created the shaft tombs.

500|$|The breed's {{survival}} {{during the}} 20th century is owed {{to a few}} families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive. John Law Ayers was one such breeder; in 1984, he donated his herd of pure-bred Cracker horses {{to the state of}} Florida. With them, the state started three small herds in Tallahassee, Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve. By 1989, however, these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remained of the breed. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established. After the registry was created, 75 horses designated as [...] "foundation horses" [...] and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered. These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts – partbred horses were denied entry to the registry. As of 2009, around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry.|$|E
