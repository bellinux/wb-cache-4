Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E

Kawasaki did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the additional cars under a separate contract, so the R62A contract was awarded to Bombardier Transportation of Quebec, who won the bid over Budd Company of Pennsylvania. While Bombardier offered a higher price per car than Budd had, the NYCTA awarded the contract to Bombardier because of the Canadian government's financial plan for the cars. In addition, Budd proposed using unapproved and untested motors, and similarly untested technology that frequently broke down on the R44 and R46 contracts.|$|E

500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium {{in their attempt to}} kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E
