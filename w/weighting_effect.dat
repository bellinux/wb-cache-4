The physics behind: Charged particles (the ions in seawater) are moving with the ocean currents in the magnetic field of the Earth which is perpendicular to the movement. Using Faraday's law of induction (the third of Maxwell's equations), it is possible to evaluate the variability of the averaged horizontal flow by measuring the induced electric currents.

40|$|The pulsed, beamwidth-limited {{atmospheric}} radar {{suffers from}} a finite resolution volume, {{making it difficult to}} resolve the small-scale irregularity structure of refractive index (or clear-air turbulence) in the scattering region. Multi-receiver and multi-frequency imaging techniques were thus proposed to improve the spatial resolution of the measurements in the finite resolution volume. The middle and upper atmosphere radar (MUR; 34. 85 ° N, 136. 10 ° N) possesses the capabilities of 5 frequencies, ranging from 46 MHz to 47 MHz, and up to 25 receivers to carry out the imaging techniques. In this paper, we exhibit the three-dimensional (3 -D) radar imaging utilizing five frequencies and 19 receivers of the MUR. The Capon method was employed for the process of imaging, and examinations of a wavy layer and turbulent structures were made, in which the spatial <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> on the imaging were mitigated beforehand. Information such as echo center and structure morphology in the resolution volume was then extracted. For example, the location distribution of echo centers could imply the traveling orientation of the wavy layer, which was correspondent with horizontal wind direction.

40|$|Abstract — Source {{separation}} and signal distortion in {{three kinds of}} BSSs with convolutive mixture are analyzed. They include a feedforward BSS, trained in the time domain and in the frequency domain, and a feedback BSS, trained in the time domain. First, an evaluation measure of signal distortion is discussed. Second, conditions for source {{separation and}} distortion free are derived. Based on these conditions, source separation and signal distortion are analyzed. The feedforward BSS has some degree of freedom, and the output spectrum can be changed. The feedforward BSS, trained in the frequency domain, has <b>weighting</b> <b>effect,</b> which can suppress signal distortion. This weighting is, however, effective only when the source spectra are similar to each other. Since, the feedforward BSS, trained in the time domain, {{does not have any}} constraints on signal distortion free, its output signals can be easily distorted. A new learning algorithm with a distortion free constraint is proposed. On the other hand, the feedback BSS can satisfy both source separation and distortion free conditions simultaneously.

The computational attention model can be decomposed into a set of features via predefined channels. Here we designed a bio-inspired vision attention model, and added the rarity measurement onto it. The priority of rarity is emphasized under the assumption of <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> upon the features logic fusion. At this stage, a final saliency map at each frame is adjusted by the spatiotemporal and rarity values. By doing this, the process of mimicking human vision attention becomes more realistic and logical to the real circumstance. The experiments are conducted on the benchmark dataset of static images and video sequences. We simulated the attention shift based on several dataset. Most importantly, our dynamic scenes are mostly selected from the objects moving on the highway and dynamic scenes. The former one can be developed on the detection of car collision {{and will be a}} useful tool for further application in robotics. We also conduct experiment on the other video clips to prove the rationality of rarity factor and feature cues fusion methods.

40|$|Standard max-margin {{structured}} prediction methods concentrate {{directly on}} the inputoutput mapping, {{and the lack of}} an elegant probabilistic interpretation causes limitations. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks (MaxEntNet) to do Bayesian max-margin structured learning by using expected margin constraints to define a feasible distribution subspace and applying the maximum entropy principle to choose the best distribution from this subspace. We show that MaxEntNet subsumes the standard max-margin Markov networks (M 3 N) as a spacial case where the predictive model is assumed to be linear and the parameter prior is a standard normal. Based on this understanding, we propose the Laplace max-margin Markov networks (LapM 3 N) which use the Laplace prior instead of the standard normal. We show that the adoption of a Laplace prior of the parameter makes LapM 3 N enjoy properties expected from a sparsified M 3 N. Unlike the L 1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimation which sets small weights to zeros to achieve sparsity, LapM 3 N posteriorly weights the parameters and features with smaller weights are shrunk more. This posterior <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> makes LapM 3 N more stable with respect to the magnitudes of the regularization coefficients and more generalizable. T...|$|E

40|$|Polygenic {{scores have}} {{recently}} been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach {{has been used to}} obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model {{as a function of the}} sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed.

40|$|Objective To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of published evidence on ethnic or racial disparities in the outpatient use versus non-use of antipsychotics {{and in the}} outpatient use of newer versus older antipsychotics. Method Electronic databases were searched for potentially relevant studies. Two independent reviewers conducted the review in three stages: title review, abstract review and full-text review. Included studies were those that: (a) report measures of disparity in the outpatient use of antipsychotic drugs in clearly defined racial or ethnic groups (b) have a primary focus on ethnic or racial disparities, and (c) have adjusted for factors known to influence medicine use. Odds ratios were pooled following the inverse-variance method of <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> sizes. I 2 statistics were calculated to quantify the amount of variation that is likely due to heterogeneity between studies. Funnel plots were produced and Egger’s statistic was calculated to assess potential publication bias. Results No {{significant differences were found}} in the odds of using any antipsychotics among African Americans (OR = 1. 01, CI = 0. 99 – 1. 02) compared with non-African Americans and among Latinos (OR = 0. 98, CI = 0. 86 – 1. 13) compared with non-Latinos. Small to moderate but statistically non-significant disparities were also noted in other ethnic groups: Asians (OR = 1. 10, CI = 0. 88 – 1. 36), Maoris (OR = 0. 78, CI = 0. 53 – 1. 13) and Pacific Islanders (OR = 0. 97, CI = 0. 84 – 1. 11).

30|$|How to {{interpret}} the current results regarding the <b>effect</b> of NP <b>weight?</b> As discussed above, although previous literature has mostly focused the relative order of two NPs in the preverbal or postverbal domain, the two theoretical accounts—production-oriented or comprehension-oriented—can both be extended to make predictions for the cross-domain shift of a single NP. In a nutshell, the production-oriented account predicts that both longer-NP-preverbal and shorter-NP-perverbal preferences are possible, {{depending on whether the}} word order is more sensitive to conceptual or positional factors. The comprehension-oriented MiD principle, on the other hand, either predicts a null <b>effect</b> of NP <b>weight</b> or makes no prediction regarding NP <b>weight</b> <b>effects,</b> depending on the assumed realm of prediction of the MiD principle. The current modeling results are more compatible with the production-oriented account. Below we discuss in detail how the U-shaped <b>weight</b> <b>effects</b> may arise from production-oriented account.|$|R
40|$|Adjustment for {{confounding}} {{factors is}} a common goal {{in the analysis of}} both observational and controlled studies. The choice of which confounding factors {{should be included in the}} model used to estimate an effect of interest is both critical and uncertain. For this reason it is important to develop methods that estimate an effect, while accounting not only for confounders, but also for the uncertainty about which confounders should be included. In a recent article, Crainiceanu et al. (2008) have identified limitations and potential biases of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) (Raftery et al., 1997; Hoeting et al., 1999) when applied to adjustment uncertainty, that arise because BMA weights models by their ability to make predictions and this may not reflect the models 2 ̆ 7 ability to correctly adjust for confounding. An important remaining question is whether it is possible to design approaches that account for adjustment uncertainty by treating the selection of variables as an unknown parameter, as BMA does, but do not suffer from the same limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation, called 2 ̆ 2 Bayesian Confounding Adjustment 2 ̆ 2 (BCA) to account for adjustment uncertainty in effect estimation from a Bayesian perspective. BCA uses a different weighting mechanism than BMA, wherein effect estimation is obtained by <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> estimates from models, all of which attempt to be fully adjusted for confounding. In simulation studies we show that BCA provides estimates of the exposure effect that have lower mean squared error than BMA and correct coverage. We then compare BCA, the approach of Crainiceanu et al. (2008), and tra- ditional BMA in a time series data set of hospital admissions, air pollution levels and weather variables in Nassau, NY for the period 1999 - 2005. Using each approach, we estimated the short-term effects of PM 2. 5 on emergency admissions for cardiovascular diseases, accounting for confounding. This application illustrates the potentially significant pitfalls of misusing variable selection methods in the con- text of adjustment uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of Raoulia and allied genera in New Zealand is reviewed {{with the aid}} of numerical phenetic analysis. Two analyses were carried out, one on 117 specimens of Raoulia using 84 morphological characters and the other on 79 specimens of Gnaphaliinae using 165 morphological characters. At least seven species exist, all falling within the currently accepted limits of Raoulia, additional to those recognised by Allan. The genus as currently recognised is heterogeneous, containing three distinct groups and several isolated species. The present subgeneric and sectional arrangement of the species is demonstrated to be inappropriate. The bulk of Raoulia should be split into two genera. The affinities of R. cinerea lie with Helichrysum. Generic limits elsewhere in the group are shown to be inaccurately defined. Thus Helichrysum bellidioides should be transferred to Anaphalioides (Benth.) Kirp., Leucogenes has closest ties to Raoulia subg. Psychrophyton and the New Zealand and Australian species of Ewartia are not congeneric. Numerical phenetic analysis is shown to be a useful tool in classification, particularly in a group such as the Gnapha 1 iinae in which genera are not clearly defined. Experiments in varying different components of the data base and of the numerical method produce many different arrangements of the same plant group, and demonstrate that no one arrangement is of necessity a reliable indication of phenetic relationships and, furthermore, that different results may all provide information useful in classification. Analyses based on floral and vegetative characters produced results different from each other and from the two combined; floral characters contribute more heavily to the overall arrangement than do vegetative ones and their contribution is greater at higher taxonomic levels. Altering the similarity measure from Gower's general coefficient of similarity to the simple matching coefficient has little effect, as does removing the <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> of additive coding of multi-state characters. In comparison, the effect of varying the clustering technique is marked, with the results of complete linkage and especially centroid sorting proving low in congruence with the similarity matrix while single linkage produces a phenograrn with low structural value.

40|$|The {{students}} of Qualters Middle School performed a study called “Benthic Macroinvertebrate Exploration in the Rumford River”. The {{study was conducted}} on October 16, 2007 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. The study location consisted of one site located at 143 Chauncy Street. The {{purpose of this study}} was to introduce benthic macroinvertebrates and their role as indicators for evaluating stream water quality. Students utilized state of the art methods and techniques during all aspects of this study. The Rumford River is listed on the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) National Priority List (NPL). The river was polluted with dioxins, furans and phenols by a wood treating company from 1953 - 1993. The amounts of pollutants and the frequency of their release are not known. As part of an EPA ecological study, benthic macroinvertebrates were studied and found to not be at a substantial risk of harm. The “Benthic Macroinvertebrate Exploration in the Rumford River” study was performed to compare our results with those found in the EPA study of 2005. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected utilizing the “kick net” method. A total of four samples were collected at the site. Each of which consisted of two low-flow and two high-flow sub-samples to ensure an accurate and diverse collection. Physical habitat data was also collected to document specific habitat information at the site. This data was evaluated against the types of organisms found to see if there were any discrepancies between habitat and macroinvertebrates within the stream study location. All physical habitat data was recorded utilizing the “Stream Biomonitoring: Physical Habitat Data Field Sheet” which was modified from CABIN. Benthic macroinvertebrates were then identified to the “order” level. This was accomplished by viewing the specimens under stereomicroscopes. Dichotomous keys found in the “Living Waters: Using Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Habitat to Assess Your River’s Health. River Watch, A Program of River Network, 1997 and Aquatic Entomology: The Fishermen’s and Ecologist’s Illustrated Guide to Insects and Their Relatives. McCafferty, Patrick, W. 1998. ” were utilized for the identification piece of the project. Order level data was recorded on the “Stream Biomonitoring: Level 1 Major Group Biotic Index” data sheet. Necessary calculations were performed to indicate the overall Major Group Biotic Index (MGBI). The calculations are as follows: average count, average organism density and group percent. These calculations were performed on an excel spreadsheet. The MGBI was then compared to the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) to give a water quality rating. The calculated MGBI for the sample location was 5. 43. This value falls between the HBI range of 5. 01 - 5. 75, which indicates a “fair” water quality rating. The 10 Max Biotic Index (10 Max MGBI) was also calculated to reduce the <b>weighting</b> <b>effect</b> of major groups containing large numbers. The calculated 10 Max MGBI for the sample location was 4. 59. This value falls between the HBI range of 4. 26 - 5. 00, which indicates a “good” water quality rating. The “Benthic Macroinvertebrate Exploration in the Rumford River” sampling program detailed a diverse macroinvertebrate community. It also showed that the Rumford River appears to be in fair condition as indicated by the macroinvertebrate community.

In this paper, we address the question of <b>weight</b> <b>effect</b> on wage, employing two-wave panel data for white females; the same panel data with more waves were used originally in Cawley (2004). We posit a semi-linear model consisting of a nonparametric function of height and weight and a linear function of the other regressors. The model is differenced {{to get rid of the}} unit specific effect, which results in a difference of two nonparametric functions with the same shape. We estimate each nonparametric function with a ‘marginal integration method’, and then combine the two estimated functions using the same shape restriction. We find that there is no <b>weight</b> <b>effect</b> on wage up to the average weight, beyond which a large negative effect kicks in. The effect magnitude is greater than that in Cawley (2004) who used a linear BMI model. The linear model gives the false impression that there would be a wage gain by becoming slimmer than the average and that the ‘obesity penalty’ is less that what it actually is.
