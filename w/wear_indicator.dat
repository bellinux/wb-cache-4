40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation of geometric effects on the wear of large aspect ratio silicon journal microbearings. The consideration of geometric conformality of rotor and hub as a critical design parameter manifests from the inherent properties of deep reactive ion etching {{as part of the}} current MEMS fabrication process employed in this dissertation. The investigation is conducted in two phases, each characterized by novel microbearing designs, fabrication processes, experimental test methodologies, and characterization techniques. The intent of Phase 1 is to focus on the effects of conformality of wear, while the intent of Phase 2 is to focus on the effects of clearance on wear. Manual assembly of rotors and hubs allows a broader range of custom bearing clearances than would otherwise be available from lithographic, pattern transfer, and etching capabilities of current in situ MEMS fabrication technologies. Novel <b>wear</b> <b>indicators,</b> intended to facilitate the rapid quantitative and qualitative determination of wear, are incorporated in the Phase 2 rotor designs. Two particular enabling features of the novel fabrication processes, namely the sprue and float etching methods, are developed in this dissertation. The sprues, patterned using the DRIE mask, hold the rotors in place during the KOH etching process. The float etching technique entails floating the device wafer on top of the KOH etchant bath. The results obtained from using the first apparatus indicate that microbearing performance, as measured by rotor rotational speed and rotor cumulative wear, is strongly dependent on conformality. The results obtained using the second apparatus indicate that microbearing rotor rotational velocity is strongly dependent on radial clearance parameter C 0. A dynamic impact model of the bearing system based on classical impulse-momentum relations is formulated in order to assess the effect of clearance on rotor rotational speed. A coefficient of restitution is obtained for silicon-on-silicon surfaces over the range of kinematically allowable radial clearance specifications...|$|R
40|$|Modem {{aircraft}} use Carbon-Carbon Composite (CCC) {{materials for}} the heat-pack elements of the brake (Tarter, 1991). The elevated wear-rate mechanism of CCC brakes at low operating temperatures (< 100 °C) is well understood (Abbott, 1995). Oxidation of these friction materials increases between temperatures of 400 °C - 600 °C (Cullinan et al, 1989), which also increases the level of heat-pack wear. The current method for monitoring the life of CCC brakes is by visual inspection of the <b>wear</b> pin <b>indicator.</b> The limitation of this method {{is that there is}} no means of determining the causes of elevated heat-pack wear.

5000|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs. Some lining <b>wear</b> <b>indicators,</b> located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external [...] "sensor", are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.|$|R

40|$|Estudou-se os mecanismos e tipos de desgaste atuantes nos machos de corte no processo de roscamento com velocidades comumente utilizadas na indústria e com alta velocidade de corte, de forma a avaliar a influência da velocidade de corte, do tipo de revestimento de ferramenta e da condição de lubri-refrigeração sobre o desempenho dos machos de corte. A qualidade da rosca usinada e a formação de cavaco também foram objetos de estudo. Mediram-se sinais de torque e de corrente ao longo da vida das ferramentas, avaliando as suas possibilidades como indicadores de desgaste. O roscamento de furos passantes M 8 x 1, 25 foi realizado com velocidades de corte de 30 ou 60 m/min em ferro fundido cinzento GG 25 nas condições sem fluido de corte ou com mínima quantidade de lubrificante (MQL). Foram utilizados machos de corte de aço rápido comum e fabricados por metalurgia do pó revestidos, com TiAIN ou com TiCN. Os principais mecanismos de desgaste foram abrasão, adesão e difusão, enquanto o {{principal}} tipo de desgaste observado foi o de flanco. A adesão de material da peça sobre a ferramenta foi o principal fator determinante do final de vida dos machos de corte. A utilização de revestimento foi eficiente na minimização da adesão. Entretanto, o TiAIN foi melhor em termos de vida da ferramenta e o TiCN na redução do torque e na qualidade visual da rosca usinada. A técnica MQL propiciou melhorias na usinagem em comparação com a condição a seco, principalmente na redução do torque em machos de corte revestidos. Os sinais de torque e de corrente foram eficientes no acompanhamento do desgaste de flanco apenas nos machos de corte revestidos. Por outro lado, apenas os sinais de torque podem servir como indicativo das etapas do ciclo de roscamento.

It was evaluated the influence of cutting speed, type of tool coating and cooling/lubrication condition {{on the performance of}} the taps. The quality of the machined threads and the chip formation were also assessed. During the experiments, torque and current signals were measured, assessing the possibilities of using them as tool <b>wear</b> <b>indicators.</b> The tapping of through holes M 8 x 1, 25 was accomplished with cutting speeds of 30 or 60 m/min in gray cast iron GG 25 in the conditions dry or with Minimal Quantity of Lubricant (MQL). Taps of plain High Speed Steel (HSS) and taps manufactured by powder metallurgy and coated (HSS-Co-PM, one with TiAIN and other with TiCN) were used. The main wear mechanisms observed were abrasion, adhesion and diffusion, while the principal type was the flank wear. The adhesion of workpiece material on the tools was the main decisive factor for the end of tool life. The tool coatings used were efficient in minimizing the adhesion. However, TiAIN was better in terms of tool life and TiCN in the reduction of torque and also led to a better visual quality on the machined threads. The MQL technique brought improvements to the machining in comparison to the dry cutting condition, mainly in the reduction of the torque in coated taps. The torque and current signals wereefficient in indicating the flank wear, only on coated taps. On the other hand, the torque signals can only be used as indicative of tapping cycle stages...|$|R
40|$|Automated Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) often {{relies on}} {{additional}} sensors sensitive to tool wear to achieve robust machining processes. The need of additional sensors could impede {{the implementation of}} tool monitoring systems in industry due to the cost and retrofitting difficulties. This paper has investigated the use of existing position encoder signals to monitor a special face turning process with constant feed per revolution and machining speed. A signal processing method by converting encoder signals into a complex-valued form and a new vibration signature extraction method based on phase function were developed to analyze the encoder signals in the frequency domain. The cumulative spectrum indicated that the spectral energy would shift from the lower to the higher frequency band with increasing cutting load. The embedded vibration signatures extracted from the encoder signals provided real-time detectability of the machining condition with distinguishable spectral modes. The embedded vibration signatures extracted from the encoder signals provided additional detectability of the machining condition with distinguishable spectral modes. In particular, tool chipping manifested itself as significant amplitude changes at a specific frequency band 20 - 30 Hz in the extracted vibration signatures. A new monitoring metric based on the XY-plane modulations combined with statistical process control charts was proposed and {{shown to be a}} robust tool wear and tool <b>wear</b> rate <b>indicator.</b> The results show that when tool chipping occurred, it could be detected in real-time when this this tool wear rate value jumped in combination with breach of the control limits.

The objective was to explore household correlates of objective MVPA in children from 12 countries. METHODS: Overall, 5, 859 nine- to eleven-year-old children from 12 countries representing a range of human and socioeconomic development <b>indicators</b> <b>wore</b> an accelerometer for 7 days and parents reported on household factors. Multilevel general linear models explored associations among household factors and MVPA variables controlling for age, sex, and parental education. RESULTS: Across sites, children with at least one piece of bedroom electronic media had lower MVPA (∼ 4 min/day; P < 0. 001) than those who did not. More frequent {{physical activity in}} the home and yard, ownership of more frequently used play equipment, and higher social support for physical activity were associated with more MVPA (all P < 0. 001).

Tooth <b>wear</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of food-processing investment and diet properties, with fitness consequences through differences in comminution efficiency, nutrient gain, and senescence. We investigate {{the relationships between}} mandible length (a proxy of skeletal body size), molar dentine thickness (a measure of tooth wear), and faecal neutral detergent fibre with residual ash (NDF-ash, a combined proxy of fibre and mineral components in the diet) in 874 male and female red deer (Cervus elaphus L., 1758) from 21 locations in moorland and woodland habitats across Scotland. Significant differences in mandible length occurred between habitats: woodland deer having larger mandibles than moorland deer. Within habitats, larger mandibles were related to higher rates of dentine wear, suggesting increased body size was associated with greater intake and processing of food. Both dentine wear and faecal NDF-ash were higher in moorland deer than in woodland deer, suggesting that fibre and (or) mineral abrasives in the diet may have contributed towards habitat differences in dentine wear. Between habitats, higher dentine wear {{was not associated with}} larger mandibles, in contrast to the relationship within habitats, indicating the precedence of additional environmental factors between habitats...|$|R
40|$|Most {{machinery}} failures {{are attributed}} to wear of components. Experimental investigation of wear is highly demanding, especially for internal combustion (IC) engines, due to the complex reciprocating mechanism. This thesis presents a simulation based approach to investigate the wear related faults in IC engine bearings, through the integration of two approaches i. e. wear and vibration based analysis, for timely fault detection and prediction of remaining lifetime of the bearings. An engine dynamics model is established to provide the connecting rod bearing with actual service environment. The inherent engine inertia and the combustion force determine the magnitude of load on the bearing. To balance this load, a hybrid force model is developed to cover a range of lubrication regimes and provide real time information on bearing dynamics. The simulated information is robust to predict wear depths and generate corresponding vibration signals {{for a range of}} operating conditions. For wear calculation, a variable wear coefficient is simulated as a function of asperity contact area during transition from the mixed to boundary lubrication regime, thus signifying the severity of impending wear with growing contact. The effect of speed, external load and bearing clearance on vibration signals and wear severity is studied and validated through experiments. Envelope analysis successfully revealed the wear critical locations and wear severity for all operating conditions tested. From simulated data, appropriate vibration and <b>wear</b> based <b>indicators</b> are identified for correlation analysis. A relation is developed which can enable the prediction of bearing wear situation directly based on the selected vibration based indicator (I-Kaz coefficient) without having to actually inspect the bearing for wear. A framework for predicting the remaining lifetime of the bearings through instantaneous wear rates obtained from simulation is also presented. The application of the developed method is demonstrated on a Toyota 3 SFE engine, but the application is equally valid for any similar engine, provided the engine parameters are updated. Being vested with the combined benefits of wear and vibration based analysis techniques; the developed simulation is capable to detect bearing faults with good accuracy, with minimal dependence on real engine testing, for validation purpose only...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature investigating the socioeconomic status (SES) {{as a potential}} risk factor of tooth wear in children, adolescents, and adults. METHODS AND MATERIALS: PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science databases were screened for studies from 1990 to 2015. Cross-referencing was used to further identify articles. Language was restricted to English. A quality appraisal of included studies was carried out using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: One thousand-one hundred and thirteen articles were initially identified from which 56 articles were full-text reviewed. Twenty-three cross-sectional multiple random clusters and prospective longitudinal studies were selected for inclusion. Included studies investigated tooth wear in 29326 individuals {{between the ages of}} 2 to ≥ 65. The majority of studies investigated erosion in children and adolescents, with only 2 studies examining adults. Included studies employed 5 different indices, and their modifications, in evaluating tooth <b>wear</b> and varying <b>indicators</b> to assess SES. Ten studies found no association between tooth wear and SES (n= 13911 participants). Thirteen studies found a positive association with SES, with 7 studies (n= 9559) demonstrating an association with high SES, and 6 studies (n= 5856) an association with low SES. On a country basis, Brazil (5 studies, n= 4835), USA (2 studies, n= 5735), and Saudi Arabia (2 studies, n= 2303) demonstrated no association between tooth wear and SES. Conversely, findings of different studies within the UK (4 studies, n= 6110) and China (4 studies, n= 4168) demonstrated conflicting positive associations with SES. CONCLUSION: Evidence supporting SES as an independent global risk factor of tooth wear in children and adolescents remains lacking, tending to be regionally-dependent. Other cofounding risk factors might explain the conflicting results, such as diet, caries, fluoridation or acid reflux. Further investigation is required to identify any potential association between SES and tooth wear in adults...|$|R
