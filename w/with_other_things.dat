2500|$|The {{essential}} partiality of {{our view}} of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, {{as there is no}} other way for things to be copresent with us and <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> than through such [...] "Abschattungen" [...] (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences [...] all [...] the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2016 presidential {{election}} campaign, Clinton made remarks about cannabis drug interactions {{in support of}} candidate Hillary Clinton's policies. The remarks included a comment made on September 24, 2016 at Youngstown State University, when she said [...] "We also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado {{where some of the}} people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the coroner believes, after they died, there was drug interactions <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> they were taking." [...] The comment was walked back by her campaign, and was regarded in many media as inaccurate and/or fictitious. The Raw Story charged Clinton with [...] "trying to mislead" [...] about risks and stated [...] "public sharing of flimsy 'anecdotal' evidence of marijuana-related deaths, based on some coroners' say-sos and 'beliefs,' was irresponsible". Live Science said they [...] "could not find any scientific or news reports of people who have died as a result of marijuana interacting with another drug". and Snopes reported that it was [...] "virtually impossible to determine what purported incidents she was citing" [...] and [...] "we were unable to corroborate [...] claim".|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "chastity" [...] is {{employed}} in two ways. First, properly; {{and thus it}} is a special virtue having a special matter, namely the concupiscences relating to venereal pleasures. Secondly, the word [...] "chastity" [...] {{is employed}} metaphorically: for just as a mingling of bodies conduces to venereal pleasure which is the proper matter of chastity and of lust its contrary vice, so too the spiritual union of the mind with certain things conduces to a pleasure which {{is the matter of}} a spiritual chastity metaphorically speaking, as well as of a spiritual fornication likewise metaphorically so called. For if the human mind delight in the spiritual union with that to which it behooves it to be united, namely God, and refrains from delighting in union <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> against the requirements of the order established by God, this may be called a spiritual chastity, according to 2 Cor. 11:2, [...] "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." [...] If, on the other hand, the mind be united to any other things whatsoever, against the prescription of the Divine order, it will be called spiritual fornication, according to Jer. 3:1, [...] "But thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers." [...] Taking chastity in this sense, it is a general virtue, because every virtue withdraws the human mind from delighting in a union with unlawful things. Nevertheless, the essence of this chastity consists principally in charity and the other theological virtues, whereby the human mind is united to God.|$|E
2500|$|The {{capital city}} {{is similar to}} the [...] "Home city" [...] concept {{implemented}} in Age of Empires III. The city functions as the player's home base for their civilization. It continues to exist even when the player logs out of the game, though it cannot be attacked or altered by other players. Through the capital city, the player can manage quests, improve technologies, send mail, craft items, participate in player to player trade, acquire and equip new gear for individual units, and visit other player's cities. Stores built within the city can be visited by other players and currency used for the items purchased will add to the player's funds. Unlike the home city from Age of Empires III where you can only customize the look of buildings, the capital city is completely customizable; buildings and rewards can be placed anywhere on the city map as the player chooses. Players can add buildings, rewards, houses as well as statues and bushes along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to decorate their capital city. [...] "Vanity Island" [...] exist to add new bushes and statues for the player to use to decorate their capital city. The city is also used as a gateway to other AI controlled cities within the region, where a player can visit and acquire new quests and items. The capital city also has many different buildings that the player can build. Craft schools, built from the city, produce gear and consumables for the player to use. Additionally, Microsoft released a crafting app for Windows Phone which a player can use to assist in crafting within the game.|$|E
