5|$|All parties, then, {{agree that}} the protests were {{organised}} beforehand; the main points of contention are <b>whether</b> the violence was planned or spontaneous, and <b>whether</b> the underlying tensions reflect separatist inclinations or a desire for social justice.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding <b>whether</b> a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting <b>whether</b> the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or <b>whether</b> it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing <b>whether</b> a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} energy levels involved, {{concerns}} have arisen at times {{in the public arena}} as to <b>whether</b> such collisions are safe, or <b>whether</b> they might, by reason of their extreme energy, trigger unforeseen problems or consequences.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{questions}} of First Amendment law could be decided, the Court had to first determine <b>whether</b> TSSAA {{was a state}} entity and so <b>whether</b> the First Amendment applied.|$|E
5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding <b>whether</b> the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} <b>whether</b> the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. <b>Whether</b> the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only speaks of tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kongs {{particular}} {{expression of}} a gorilla villain and a carpenter hero (with or without a fire hat) who must dodge various obstacles (<b>whether</b> bombs or fireballs) while climbing up ladders (<b>whether</b> complete or broken) and picking up prizes (umbrellas or purses) to rescue a fair-haired (<b>whether</b> knotted or pigtailed) hostage from the gorilla is protractible against Universal and its licensees.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown <b>whether</b> the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, <b>whether</b> they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Fees for {{applying}} vary based on <b>whether</b> or not an applicant is {{applying for a}} new passport or they are renewing an expiring passport for either 1 or 5 years. Fees also vary depending on <b>whether</b> an applicant is {{under the age of}} 5.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the decision <b>whether</b> to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or <b>whether</b> to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide {{as a measure of}} insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to <b>whether</b> someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} <b>whether</b> Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to {{determine}} <b>whether</b> someone is in custody the courts apply a reasonable person test: <b>whether</b> a reasonable {{person would have}} felt free to leave or not.|$|E
5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was <b>whether</b> the plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second was <b>whether</b> {{there had been an}} inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, <b>whether</b> the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not {{to judge}} <b>whether</b> {{or not the}} sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but <b>whether</b> the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|The case {{considers}} <b>whether</b> the United States Congress may {{pass legislation}} preventing the Supreme Court from hearing {{the case of}} an accused combatant before his military commission takes place, <b>whether</b> the special military commissions that had been set up violated federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice and treaty obligations), and <b>whether</b> courts can enforce the articles of the 1949 Geneva Convention.|$|E

5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over <b>whether</b> to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over <b>whether</b> to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on <b>whether</b> to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over <b>whether</b> to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over <b>whether</b> to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict about <b>whether</b> or not a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain {{as the number}} for the total invasion force. For instance, it is unclear <b>whether</b> the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or <b>whether</b> Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the case was <b>whether</b> Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely <b>whether</b> {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, <b>whether</b> those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{timelines}} displayed here cover {{events from}} the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as <b>whether</b> humans will become extinct, <b>whether</b> protons decay, or <b>whether</b> or not the earth survives when the sun expands to the red giant.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal <b>whether</b> {{a person has}} a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as <b>whether</b> the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and <b>whether</b> the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine <b>whether</b> they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about <b>whether</b> the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, <b>whether</b> the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the Donbass were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of Ukraine. A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic autonomy for Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included <b>whether</b> Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, <b>whether</b> Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, <b>whether</b> Ukraine should federalise, and <b>whether</b> Ukraine should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{disagree}} as to <b>whether</b> Salientia is a superorder {{that includes}} the order Anura, or <b>whether</b> Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.|$|E

5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered <b>whether</b> this was due to combat fatigue or <b>whether</b> the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain <b>whether</b> this directly causes TPP or <b>whether</b> it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Charismatics {{trace their}} {{historical}} origins to the charismatic {{movement of the}} 1960s and 1970s. They are distinguished from Pentecostals {{because they tend to}} allow for differing viewpoints on <b>whether</b> Spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and <b>whether</b> tongues is always a sign of receiving the baptism.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide <b>whether</b> freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, <b>whether</b> it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or <b>whether</b> it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about <b>whether</b> lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. <b>whether</b> they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about <b>whether</b> arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} graphs, {{the maximum}} spanning tree solution cannot be used. Instead, several different algorithms are known; {{the choice of}} which algorithm to use depends on <b>whether</b> a start or destination vertex for the path is fixed, or <b>whether</b> paths for many start or destination vertices must be found simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In {{the feature}} film Crimson Tide, a {{discussion}} {{between the two}} main characters over <b>whether</b> Lipizzans came from Spain or Portugal, and <b>whether</b> they are born white or black, is used to represent the film's suppressed racial conflict and the dividing of the world between two main powers during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} remarked, {{that it seems}} to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, <b>whether</b> societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or <b>whether</b> they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to check <b>whether</b> a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge <b>whether</b> the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with <b>whether</b> the horse was being ridden or driven, and <b>whether</b> they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
