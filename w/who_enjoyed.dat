5|$|However, the ABC {{received}} more than 250complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to talkback radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.|$|E

This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|Developed as a {{defensive}} specialist through much of his career, Conroy was twice {{a finalist for the}} Frank J.

He played over 1,000 games in the NHL and was the second-oldest player in League history to reach that milestone. Conroy, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> his greatest offensive seasons with the Flames, is a former captain of the team and was twice honored by the organization for his leadership, dedication and humanitarian efforts.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's uncle, Duke Frederick of Bavaria-Landshut, {{suggested}} in 1383 {{that she be}} considered as a bride to King Charles VI of France. The match was proposed again at the lavish Burgundian double wedding in Cambrai in April 1385—John the Fearless and his sister Margaret of Burgundy married Margaret and William of Bavaria-Straubing respectively. Charles, then 17, rode in the tourneys at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> jousting and hunting and was excited to be married.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the character's humor, complexity, charisma and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{held the}} comital title for only three months. In July {{he was sent}} north to quell a {{rebellion}} instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick.

Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the absolute confidence of the king.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} concerted between Eastern Emperor Leo, Western Emperor Anthemius, and General Marcellinus, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{independence}} in Illyricum. Basiliscus {{was ordered to}} sail directly to Carthage, while Marcellinus attacked and took Sardinia, and a third army, commanded by Heraclius of Edessa, landed on the Libyan coast east of Carthage, making rapid progress. It appears that the combined forces met in Sicily, whence the three fleets moved at different periods.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Governor Stevenson {{resigned}} {{his office}} to accept {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate, and the remainder of his term was filled by President Pro Tem of the Senate Preston Leslie. When Leslie, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> only lukewarm support from his party, sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1871, Brown's name was among those put in nomination against his; after a few ballots, however, it became clear that Brown {{would not be able to}} gain a majority, and his supporters abandoned their support of him in favor of other candidates. The following year, Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 10,888 to 457 and was allowed to assume his seat. He was twice re-elected, serving until 1877.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E

5|$|John ruled as Despot in Thessalonica for two years, {{until his}} death in 1244. Theodore himself retired to Vodena, from where he {{supervised}} the affairs of state. On John's death he raised his younger son Demetrios Komnenos Doukas (r. 1244–46) in his place, and sent an embassy to Nicaea to announce the succession, as befitted the terms of vassalage agreed in 1242. If John was a religious ascetic, Demetrios was a dissolute youngster <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> partying with his favourites and seducing married women. Although Theodore remained in charge of governance, Demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct Nicaean rule with favour.|$|E
5|$|The emperor, <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{paramount}} social status, was {{the head}} of the government administration. His rule was virtually absolute, although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions. Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The emperor had the sole right to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-dan or higher. The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government. Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, or student graduates of the Imperial University. This institution was established in 124 BC, and provided a Confucian-based education for those entering civil service.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} brought in to be a low-budget {{replacement}} for a script by Stephen Fry that had been pushed back, and was filmed mainly in the Tremorfa area of Cardiff at a housing estate. Graham was asked to write an episode primarily for children which would soften the much darker finale that would be broadcast after. The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an Appreciation Index of 83. Though Graham received letters from children <b>who</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics.|$|E
