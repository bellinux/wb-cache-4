Asked later about the writing and recording process, McIlrath said, [...] "We kind of blocked a month off over the winter and said, 'Let's all get together, get the rehearsal space, and start putting some ideas together,' which is what we did. And then, we also blocked off a week or two at the Blasting Room after <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Fort Collins to just kind of jam stuff out, get some new ideas going." ...|$|E

Yesterday I saw 75 freshly dug graves in one cemetery in addition to four mutilated corpses we were shown in the mosque when <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Agdam late on Tuesday.
