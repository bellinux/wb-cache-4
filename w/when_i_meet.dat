500|$|Throughout the war, the King and Queen {{provided}} morale-boosting visits {{throughout the}} United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944. Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place {{as symbols of}} national resistance. At a social function in 1944, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: [...] "You should worry, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him, I always think he's after mine!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maalin {{remained}} in the Merca area, where he was employed {{in a range of}} roles. In the mid-1990s, he was selling medicines in a nearby small town. Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate poliomyelitis from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008. He explained his motivation for volunteering: [...] "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too." [...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities. The Boston Globe described him as one of the [...] "most valuable" [...] local coordinators for WHO. He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: [...] "Now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I tell them how important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me." [...] He continued to work as a regional coordinator for the vaccination drive, and was hailed as one of the [...] "true heroes" [...] of the campaign.|$|E

My mother said that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> a Hedgehog I am to drop him {{into the water and}} then he will uncoil, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> a Tortoise I am to scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which of you is Hedgehog and which is Tortoise? because, to save my spots, I can't tell.' ...|$|E
60|$|But unto thee, <b>when</b> thee <b>I</b> <b>meet,</b> My pulses thicken fast, As {{when the}} maddened lake grows black And ruffles in the blast.|$|R

6000|$|Then, Julia, let me woo thee, [...] Thus, thus to come unto me, [...] And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>meet</b> [...] Thy silvery feet, [...] My soul I'll {{pour into}} thee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly,' {{returned}} Nicholas; 'and you {{acted upon}} that principle <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> you on horseback on the road, after our memorable evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'San infern'l shame," [...] said he indignantly. [...] "I'll no forgerrit <b>when</b> <b>I...</b> <b>meet</b> the French." [...] Then he too {{fell into}} reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} worse for the Marquis of Morella <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him again," [...] {{answered}} Peter sternly. [...] "What is your story, Nurse Inez?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then adieu until a {{week from}} to-day, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> will <b>meet</b> you here at this hour and bestow upon you the last three gifts which you are {{entitled}} to receive. Good-by!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be so}} nice! And then I {{shall be}} sure to have you with me the first moment I see them. I shall think it very awful <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>meet</b> your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't be afraid," [...] said Ralph. [...] "I'm {{not going}} to hurt anybody's feelings. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>meet</b> that man, <b>I</b> hope I may be able to keep him from knowing what I think of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{certainly}} I should not. I may doubt when I {{am talking}} behind his back; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him {{face to face}} I cannot do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I drink {{very little}} as a rule," [...] said Little Chandler modestly. [...] "An odd half-one or so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> any of the old crowd: that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} between you and Hubby?" [...] demanded Agatha, {{interrupting}} her. [...] "You had better tell me, or I will ask him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I met you first--ah, <b>when</b> did <b>I</b> first <b>meet</b> you? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{was full}} of wonder, and innocent, Standing meek-eyed with those of choric bent, [...] While dimming day grew dimmer [...] In the pulpit-glimmer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh Robin, thou didst love me well, [...] Till, on {{a bitter}} day, [...] She came, the Lady Isabel, [...] And stole thy heart away. [...] My tears are vain: I live again [...] In days {{that used to}} be, [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> could <b>meet</b> thy welcome feet [...] Beneath the Willow-Tree.|$|R
6000|$|Fletcher {{turned to}} Duane. [...] "Pard, I'm takin' it on myself thet you <b>meet</b> enemies here <b>when</b> <b>I</b> swore you'd <b>meet</b> friends. It's my fault. I'll stand by {{you if you}} let me." ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> {{the weary}} eyes The reddened aching {{eyes of the}} bar-man with thin [...] arms, I am glad {{to go back to}} where I came from.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Bishop," [...] {{answered}} Tabitha, [...] "I {{never tell}} {{her all the}} queer things that Menzi says to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him, {{or at least not}} many of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked on}} the floor and then he looked at me, with a steady, earnest gaze. [...] "I should like well to tell you my story," [...] he said. [...] "I have been ordered not to tell it, but I have {{resolved}} that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> should <b>meet</b> a man to whom I should be moved to speak I would speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{saw him at}} {{the club}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to <b>meet</b> my cousin. His name is Count Metterheim, and {{he is on the}} {{military}} staff at the Embassy here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you did, did you!" [...] she retorted. [...] "But {{you never}} once came near me yourself, save <b>when</b> <b>I</b> chanced to <b>meet</b> {{you in the}} hall, tho' I was there a full three hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weren't we silly?" [...] said Felicity. [...] "I {{really can}} never look Billy Robinson {{in the face}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him. I'm always sure he's {{laughing}} at me in his sleeve." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, {{lover and}} perfect equal! I meant {{that you should}} {{discover}} me so, by my faint indirections; And I, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> you, mean to discover you by the like in you.|$|E

6000|$|... "Play {{you some}} day, if you like," [...] Hebblethwaite suggested, {{as he called}} for a taxi. [...] "They took my {{handicap}} down two last week at Walton Heath--not before it was time, either. By-the-by, <b>when</b> can <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> the young lady? My people may be out of town next week, but I'll give you both a lunch or a dinner, if you'll say the word. Thursday night, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|Giving this hapless {{little one}} {{in charge of}} a woman who seemed to be an {{inhabitant}} of the same building, I hurried away, but had not gone a hundred yards <b>when</b> <b>I</b> chanced to <b>meet</b> Nicholas.|$|R
60|$|I {{did not see}} {{him again}} for years. The streets of life are very crowded, and if we loose each other's hands we are soon hustled far apart. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> did next <b>meet</b> him it was by accident.|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Harry sat uneasily in the dining-room. [...] "D---- it all, Rosa," [...] said he at last, [...] "can't {{you leave}} the child alone? He's a good enough little chap <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cheyne {{made her}} a little grave inclination. [...] "Then, I hope we shall be good friends <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> the other one. I am going to stay some little time in the cattle country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, mebbe so. But I'm not lookin' for a movin' target <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> up with Beasley. I'm a hossman, not a hunter. You're used to shootin' {{flies off}} deer's horns, jest for practice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear no. In what {{position}} am I, alas! to do that? <b>When</b> can <b>I</b> EVER <b>meet</b> her again?" [...] He {{had turned}} it all over.

5000|$|... "My {{inspiration}} {{comes from}} my customers...how they move, how they talk, their attitudes, their lifestyles. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>meet</b> a new customer, I make her understand that I {{am here to}} make you look good," [...] Chandran's favourite designers are Valentino [...] "...for his femininity and finishing...", and Galliano who [...] "...has a great spirit." [...] He admires Hussein Chalayan for his works and how he dealt with his bankruptcy.|$|R
6000|$|But {{now will}} canker sorrow eat my bud, [...] And chase the native beauty from his cheek, [...] And he will look as hollow as a ghost; [...] As dim and meagre as an ague's fit: [...] And so he'll die; and, rising so again, [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>meet</b> {{him in the}} court of heaven [...] I shall not know him: {{therefore}} never, never [...] Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.|$|R
