5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community <b>where</b> <b>every</b> {{individual}} was encouraged to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game <b>where</b> <b>every</b> pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1990, the Pittston Coal Company and the UMWA {{came to a}} settlement. The current miners of Pittston {{would receive}} health and {{retirement}} benefits once again. Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $10million for the retirement benefits plan for pre-1974 miners. In return Pittston was permitted to operate {{seven days a week}} {{as long as they were}} closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule <b>where</b> <b>every</b> 28 days they would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E

5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling <b>where</b> <b>every</b> vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

The opening shots were fired by Syrian artillery on kibbutz Ein Gev at approximately 01:00 on May 16. At dawn, Syrian aircraft attacked the Kinarot valley villages. The following day, a Syrian company which split from the main force attacked the water station with heavy weaponry, <b>where</b> <b>every</b> worker was killed except one.|$|E

Composed of 51 to 101 members, determined proportionately {{by the size of}} the constituency, it maintains political priorities, alliances, and rhetoric, and elects an Executive Committee of 9 to 15 members for daily organizational activities. Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

The hurricane damaged or destroyed 75primary or secondary schools, with only two left in working condition. All of Grenada was left without power or running water.|$|E

5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, <b>where</b> <b>every</b> nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Triple H {{formed a}} stable known as Evolution with Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista. Triple H and Flair {{challenged}} Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship, but {{they lost the}} match. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004 and the height of their dominance occurred after Armageddon, <b>where</b> <b>every</b> member of Evolution left the pay-per-view holding a title. Triple H held the World Heavyweight Championship for most of 2003, defending it at a match against Booker T at WrestleMania XIX in an angle with racist undertones. He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Bill Goldberg, in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost, {{he would have to}} retire. After a failed attempt to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at the Survivor Series, he finally regained the championship against Goldberg in a triple threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane. At the 2004 Royal Rumble, Triple H and Shawn Michaels fought in a Last Man Standing match to a double countout, so Triple H retained the title as a result. Triple H dropped the title to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX. Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22 episode of Raw and failed to capture the WWE Championship from Eddie Guerrero. Triple H was drafted back to Raw without competing on SmackDown! and unsuccessfully tried to reclaim the World Heavyweight title from Chris Benoit in subsequent rematches, including a rematch from WrestleMania between Triple H, Benoit, and Shawn Michaels at Backlash, but came out unsuccessful.|$|E
