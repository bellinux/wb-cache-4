5|$|The {{individual}} {{regions of}} the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media {{and the opening of}} the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices – the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South – but became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England – especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East – has a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{barred from}} several disciplines; {{but on the}} other hand, there are women-only disciplines, such as rhythmic {{gymnastics}} and synchronized swimming.|$|E
25|$|Ski {{jumping and}} Canoeing (both sprint and slalom disciplines) are two Olympic sports that feature fewer events for women. In Canoeing, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> entirely {{excluded}} from the Canoe sub-discipline (as opposed to the Kayak sub-discipline). At the 2012 Summer Olympics 30 fewer gold medals were available for female competitors. In the meanwhile, men are excluded from competing in synchronised swimming and rhythmic gymnastics at the summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|Latin America {{at large}} has been {{considered}} by many analysts {{as a place where}} <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> subject to a significant degree of discrimination. Obtaining a degree in education is one the dreams that many women inside Western civilization aspire to. Low income Latin American women, while culturally belonging to the same Western civilization, often do not have the opportunity to continue their studies up to higher education due to poverty and unemployment.|$|E
25|$|According to Matsya Purana, Daksha and {{his wife}} Panchajani(Virani) had 62 daughters, not one of whom resembled their father. 10 of those daughters were married to Dharma, 13 to sage Kashyapa, 27 to Chandra, 4 to Arishtanemi, 1 to Kama, 1 to lord Shiva, 2 to sons of sage Bhrigu, 2 to sage Angiras, 2 to Krisasva. According to Padma Purana, when Daksha felt the number of <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> not sufficient, he decided to have 60 more daughters.|$|E
25|$|In the European Union {{and other}} Developed {{countries}} such as the United States, female unemployment is higher than male unemployment. In 2006, Seven percent {{of women in the}} Developed World were unemployed as compared to 6% of men. Both rates have increased dramatically since the Great Recession but more <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> unemployed than men in these countries. Data demonstrates that a greater proportion of women are unemployed relative to men in majority Muslim countries but that trend is true of several non-Muslim majority regions as well.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{when women}} {{have the right to}} work and are educated, women's job {{opportunities}} may in practice be unequal to those of men. In Egypt for example, women have limited opportunities to work in the private sector because <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> expected to put their role in the family first, which causes men to be seen as more reliable in the long term. In Saudi Arabia, it is illegal for Saudi women to drive, serve in military and other professions with men. It is becoming more common for Saudi Arabian women to procure driving licences from other Gulf Cooperation Council states such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to higher {{education}} had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. Despite this, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> at a disadvantage compared to men because of motherhood. Women are viewed as the primary caregiver to children still to this day, so their pay is lowered when they have children because businesses do not expect them to stay long after the birth.|$|E
500|$|The only sport on the Olympic {{programme}} {{that features}} {{men and women}} competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no [...] "Women's Eventing", or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the programme in the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men. In the winter Olympics, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> unable {{to compete in the}} Nordic Combined. There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: synchronised swimming and rhythmic gymnastics.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the average}} Indian woman's life is spent in marriage; many <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> married before the legal age of 18, and the {{incidence}} of non-marriage is low in India. [...] Childbearing and raising children are the priorities of early adulthood for Indian women. Thus, if they enter the workforce at all, it is far later than Indian men. [...] Urban Indian men reach the peak of their labour force participation {{between the ages of}} 25 and 29, while urban Indian women do so between the ages of 40 and 44. Because of this, women have less time for the acquisition of skills and fewer opportunities for job improvements.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Ono {{created the}} piece Arising in Venice, Italy. As {{part of the}} {{exhibition}} Personal Structures, organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre's Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagary of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record Rising and this piece, Ono responded: [...] "Rising was telling all people {{that it is time}} for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope Arising will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together." ...|$|E
500|$|Chinese modern {{heterosexual}} monogamous {{marriage was}} officially established with the Marriage Law of 1950 [...] after {{the founding of}} the People's Republic of China. The New Marriage Law declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system, which included arranged and forced marriage, male superiority, and the disregard for the interests of children. This law also asserted the rights to divorce and embraced the free-choice marriage. Although progress has been made, Chinese women are restricted by the heteronormative and hypergamous marriage system. Currently, all Chinese <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> expected to marry a man with superior educational and economic status in their early or mid-twenties. Many well-educated and well-paid urban professional women tend to delay their partner seeking and marriage, which results in a supposed revival of tradition – parental matchmaking. Since Chinese parents generally do not [...] "use a daughter's marriage to build a family network or maintain a household's social status" [...] anymore, this matchmaking is not a forced marriage; it is a suggestion intended to benefit their daughters.|$|E

500|$|In general, in the uneducated {{and rural}} {{sections}} of Indian society, which form a major {{percentage of the}} total population, women are seen as economic burdens. [...] Their contributions to productivity are mostly invisible as their familial and domestic contributions are overlooked. [...] Indian women were contributing nearly 36 percent of total employment in agriculture and related activities, nearly 19 percent in the service sector, and nearly 12.5 in the industry sector as of the year 2000. [...] High illiteracy rates among women confine them to lower paying, unskilled jobs with less job security than men. [...] Even in agricultural jobs where the work of men and women are highly similar, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> more likely to be paid less for the same amount and type of work as men. Although the Government of India has tried to eliminate inequality in the workforce, women still receive unequal treatment. [...] "Men are more likely to get promotions than women—besides, for men the nature of their jobs often changed with these promotions, unlike women, who usually only got increased responsibility and higher workload." ...|$|E
500|$|Atwell, who portrayed Carter in , , and the Agent Carter short film, {{expressed}} interest in reprising the role for the series in October 2013; ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014. Carter is the first female character to headline a standalone story {{as part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), ahead of popular comic characters such as Black Widow and Captain Marvel. Unlike other major Marvel heroes, Carter does not have any superpowers, instead the writers [...] "always said her superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage, because she doesn’t have superstrength." [...] Atwell said it was [...] "thrilling" [...] to explore [...] "the backdrop of this male-dominated world, where <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in the workforce, unspoken for and struggling to find a place outside the home" [...] and how it affects Carter, who must deal with this along with the missions she receives. For Carter's costumes, though some vintage pieces were used, most of her outfits were custom made to accommodate the scripted action scenes. Costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton gave the outfits an [...] "hourglass style with strength in the tailoring and defined shoulders, but not overly exaggerated." [...] For the character's tactical gear, World War II underground military looks were referenced. Gabriella Graves portrays a young Carter.|$|E

2500|$|A playwright named Aeschylus changed Western {{literature}} forever when {{he introduced}} {{the ideas of}} dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. [...] In doing so, he essentially invented [...] "drama": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. [...] Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. [...] Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex. [...] Euripedes, conversely, used plays to challenge societal norms and moresa hallmark of much of Western literature for the next 2,300 years and beyondand his works such as Medea, The Bacchae and The Trojan <b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> notable {{for their ability to}} challenge our perceptions of propriety, gender, and war.

2500|$|Depending on {{the area}} within South Africa, {{the manner in which}} honor is {{expressed}} varies. For example, traditionally in rural areas, women handled all agricultural jobs (except for herding and plowing). They also took care of the home and the children. Men were involved in various aspects of life including politics, all jobs that required heavy lifting and moving and took care of their animals. [...] Many men become what is called a labor migrant and send their earnings back to their families and in some families women are labor migrants instead of men. Because of high rates of unemployment, more and more women have taken on this role. For those families who live in the city, both men and women go to work, but <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> responsible for taking care of the home (both mothers and the oldest daughter in the home).|$|E
