40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics {{approach has been}} adopted {{to show that the}} addition of polymeric binders to a <b>wet</b> <b>powder</b> mass reduces the brittleness of the dried mass.

40|$|In {{high shear}} mixer granulation, the powder is {{agitated}} in a vessel while liquid is sprayed onto the powder. Formation of “nuclei” can be predicted using a nucleation regime map. However, this approach assumes that only dry powder enters the spray zone. Industrial granulation processes commonly add 20 – 50 wt % fluid, and the partially <b>wetted</b> <b>powder</b> recirculates many times through the spray zone. The effect of partially <b>wetted</b> <b>powder</b> re-entering the spray zone is not currently known. To investigate, droplets were added to a powder bed at controlled separation distances and time intervals. A strong correlation between drop penetration time and droplet motion on the powder bed surface was observed. For fast penetrating systems, nucleation was only slightly affected {{by the presence of}} the previous droplet. However, systems with long penetration times showed lateral droplet motion due to Laplace pressure differences. Implications for the nucleation regime map are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Tastes in {{preparation}} changed during the Ming dynasty; the Hongwu Emperor (1328-1398) himself preferred leaves to <b>powdered</b> <b>cakes,</b> and would accept only leaf tea as tribute from tea-producing regions.

While in China the art of Jian ware faded and then died out, in Japan it continued and became the foremost producer of this type of ware, also due to the importance and development of the tea ceremony.|$|R

40|$|Granulation of poorly <b>wetting</b> <b>powders</b> is {{a common}} problem in the pharmaceutical, {{minerals}} and fertilizer industries. It is usually assumed that good wetting {{is a prerequisite for}} good nucleation. Although this is generally true, robust granulations with poor <b>wetting</b> <b>powders</b> are possible. Recent investigation confirmed that nucleation can occur by spreading of hydrophobic sub-micron particles around the droplet, termed &# 039;solid spreading nucleation&# 039;. Moreover, nuclei formed consist of a consolidated powder shell and an empty core, and have extremely high porosity with adequate strength. In this study, single drop solid-spreading nucleation experiments were performed, where single drops of water and glycerin were produced using a microlitre syringe and placed onto loosely packed powder beds. Several powders including salicylic acid, 2 -Ethoxybenzamide and three size grades of hydrophobic glass ballotini were used. Nucleus formation was observed via high speed video camera and a microscope. Preliminary experiments suggest that some bulk fluid motion is required for shell formation to occur, and that smaller particle size, lower fluid viscosity and higher kinetic energy during impact all favor the formation of a powder shell. Based on experimental results and observations, solid spreading nucleation mechanism and a model for surviving liquid marble was suggeste...|$|R

50|$|Magnetic yoke is a {{hand-held}} device that induces {{a magnetic field}} between two poles. Common applications are for outdoor use, remote locations, and weld inspection. The draw back of magnetic yokes is that they only induce a magnetic field between the poles, so large-scale inspections using the device can be time-consuming. For proper inspection the yoke needs to be rotated 90 degrees for every inspection area to detect horizontal and vertical discontinuities. Subsurface detection using a yoke is limited. These systems used dry magnetic <b>powders,</b> <b>wet</b> <b>powders,</b> or aerosols.|$|R

The caking behaviour of cocoa beverage powders, with varying amounts of a carbohydrate sensitive ingredient, as affected by climate conditions was studied in this work.

Glass transition temperatures (T(g)) at several a(w) were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry and fitted to the Gordon-Taylor equation. Deduced T(g) = f(a(w)) functions helped to identify stability or caking zones. Specific experimental methods, based on the analysis of mechanical properties of <b>powder</b> <b>cakes</b> formed under compression, were used to quantify the degree of caking.
