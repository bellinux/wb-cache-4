25|$|After dwindling ratings again, {{the show}} made its craziest decision. All {{the victims are}} brought back alive on the {{tropical}} Island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). The fired actors (James Reynolds, Suzanne Rogers, Matthew Ashford, Alexis Thorpe, Josh Taylor, Peggy McCay, Frances Reid, Thaao Penghlis and Deidre Hall) all returned to their original roles. There was also another twist, the killer wasn't Marlena. Stefano DiMera's nephew, Andre (posing as Tony DiMera) had kidnapped them and made Marlena think she <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> off her friends and family. The storyline was incredibly controversial, and garnered the soap a lot of press.|$|E
25|$|The Third Pandemic of {{bubonic plague}} {{broke out in}} China in the 1880s. By the spring of 1894 about 100,000 were {{reported}} dead in the mainland. In May 1894 the disease erupted into Hong Kong's overcrowded Chinese quarter of Tai Ping Shan. By {{the end of the}} month, an estimated 450 people died of the illness. At its height, the epidemic <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> 100 people per day, and it killed a total of 2,552 people that year. The disease was greatly detrimental to trade and produced a temporary exodus of 100,000 Chinese from the colony. Plague continued to be a problem in the territory for the next 30 years. In the 1870s a typhoon hit Hong Kong one evening reaching its height by midnight. An estimated 2,000 people lost their lives in a span of just six hours.|$|E

500|$|Whereas the {{influence}} of Greek tragedies {{is clear from the}} choice of title, the absent father, and the roles of incest and parricide, Littell makes it clear that he was influenced by more than the structure of The Oresteia. He found that the idea of morality in Ancient Greece is more relevant for making judgments about responsibility for the Holocaust than the Judeo-Christian approach, wherein the idea of sin can be blurred by the concepts such as intentional sin, unintentional sin, sinning by thought, or sinning by deed. For the Greeks it was the commission of the act itself upon which one is judged: Oedipus is guilty of patricide, even if he did not know that he <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> his father.|$|E

Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, [...] "I see they have given him the V.C. Of course he won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that." [...] The authors themselves described the story of Ball's life as that of [...] "a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill {{at a time when}} all the world <b>was</b> <b>killing...</b> saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death".|$|E

[...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly {{he was a}} big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{portion of}} the book {{discusses}} how to make specific choices in targeted killing situations prior to state actors carrying out actions against individuals. University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law professor Amos N. Guiora discusses [...] "The Importance of Criteria-Based Reasoning in Targeted Killing Decisions" [...] and concludes that instead of combatant commanders in the field, lawyers in consultation with decision algorithms must make decisions on targets. Pepperdine University School of Law professor Gregory S. McNeal critiques the arguments of those against targeted killing in his essay, [...] "Are Targeted Killings Unlawful? A Case Study in Empirical Claims Without Empirical Evidence". He differentiates between decision-making processes of the United States military {{and those of the}} Central Intelligence Agency, emphasizing the U.S. military tactic of attempting to avoid collateral damage. Ave Maria School of Law associate professor Kevin H. Govern examines the killing of Osama Bin Laden in his piece [...] "Operation Neptune Spear: <b>Was</b> <b>Killing</b> Bin Laden a Legitimate Military Objective?". He says this particular killing was justified and borne out of a rational decision-making process. American University Washington College of Law professor Kenneth Anderson distinguishes the use of military drones from targeted killing in his article [...] "Efficiency in Bello and ad Bellum: Making the Use of Force Too Easy?". He says targeted killing as response to threats and to prevent potential terrorist attacks is justified.|$|E
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that he knew what he was doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he <b>was</b> <b>killing</b> a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{emphasizes}} another {{theme of}} the season: Buffy's response to forces that she cannot fight. Throughout the season she encounters the much more powerful goddess Glory, but Joyce's death leaves her feeling the most helpless. In Joyce's death there is no evil force to combat; she simply dies, and Buffy, with all her power, is ill-equipped to grasp the enormity of her situation. In her shock, Buffy retreats to a childlike state of confusion, calling to her mother when she does not answer: [...] "Mom?... Mom?... Mommy?" [...] Emma Caulfield was also given the direction for her voice to rise to a childlike pitch {{at the end of}} her speech to give the same effect. According to Buffy scholar Rhonda Wilcox, the themes of maturation and facing adult responsibilities begin with the departure of Buffy's boyfriend Riley Finn six episodes before, and crystallize in the preceding episode in which Buffy realizes she does not need a boyfriend to be fulfilled. At the end of that episode she is confronted with Joyce's death, which is fully explored in [...] "The Body". Facing responsibilities became the major {{theme of the}} sixth season. One critic writes, [...] "Drastic as it <b>was,</b> <b>killing</b> off Joyce was the logical way to bring Buffy and Dawn closer together, sever Buffy's last ties to girlhood and emphasize Buffy's inability to accept the limits of her power, a recurring theme this season." ...|$|E
