The other extensive opinion in the case was by Judge Spencer Roane, who contrasted the presumption of freedom for Indians, as well as condemned Hudgins for failing to introduce evidence of any black ancestry of those seeking their freedom. Thus, all the appellate judges held that the two-decades old Declaration of Rights {{did not apply to}} blacks.

5|$|Illness forced Mason to absent {{himself from}} the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, {{and he did not}} attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With {{independence}} from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to decide how Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Richard Henry Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress {{to be a part of}} the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George <b>Wythe,</b> and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The Wytheville Raid or Toland's Raid (July 18, 1863) was {{an attack}} by an {{undersized}} Union brigade on a Confederate town during the American Civil War. Union Colonel John Toland led a brigade of over 800 men against a Confederate force of about 130 soldiers and 120 civilians. Wytheville, the county seat of <b>Wythe</b> County in southwestern Virginia, had strategic importance because of a nearby lead mine and the railroad that served it. The mine supplied the lead for about {{one third of the}} Confederate Army's bullets. The Virginia & Tennessee Railroad transported Confederate troops and supplies, and telegraph wires along the railroad line were vital for communications. In addition to moving the lead to bullet manufacturing facilities, the railroad also served an important salt works in an adjacent county.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sandwich {{composite}} panel {{is a new}} developed building material applied in steel residential houses, but the theory and experiment of this panel is still limited. In order to study {{the influence of the}} boundary conditions and shear connector patterns on flexural behavior of the panels, two groups of panels were cast and tested. Failure modes of the test panels under the uniformed transverse load, load-deformation response, strains in two concrete <b>wythes,</b> crack loads and ultimate load-bearing capacity were recorded and analysed. Test results showed that different angles and distances of plane truss shear connectors affected the ultimate flexural strengths significantly. The strain curves of two concrete <b>wythes</b> revealed that the plane truss shear connectors of panels worked well to make the two <b>wythes</b> act as a solid slab.

5|$|According to his biographer, Lowell H.

After his father's death, the younger Breckinridge helped support the family by selling whiskey, brandy, and hemp. He learned surveying from his uncle, William Preston, and between 1774 and 1779, he was {{employed as a}} recorder in the land office of Fincastle. Preston sought opportunities for his nephew to attend private schools alongside his sons, but such schools were prone to intermittent operation, and Breckinridge's other responsibilities interfered with his attendance. Preston also nominated Breckinridge as deputy surveyor of Montgomery County, a position he accepted after passing the requisite exam on February 1, 1780. Later that year, he joined his cousin, future Kentucky Senator John Brown, at William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary).

5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention {{saw only}} about a dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} only five states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, <b>Wythe,</b> and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E

25|$|On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress {{convened in}} Philadelphia. When war seemed inevitable, <b>Wythe</b> was elected as Virginia's {{delegate}} to replace George Washington, who took {{command of the}} continental forces. George and Elizabeth <b>Wythe</b> moved to Philadelphia by September, and were inoculated against smallpox, as were fellow delegate Francis Lightfoot Lee and his lady and others. By October, Thomas Jefferson had rejoined the Congress to work with his former teacher and the other delegates, although personal tragedy forced him to leave for five months {{in the winter and}} spring. <b>Wythe</b> accepted many assignments relating to military, currency and other matters. He, John Dickinson and John Jay also went to New Jersey that winter and convinced that colony's assembly to maintain a united front. When petitions and other attempts failed to resolve the crisis by the following summer, all while Dunmore's raiders harassed Virginia settlements from its waterways, <b>Wythe</b> moved and then voted in favor of the resolution for independence that Jefferson had drafted upon his return. His fellow Virginia delegates in Philadelphia held <b>Wythe</b> in such esteem, that they left the first space open for <b>Wythe</b> when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, John Adams, who did not like many Virginians, thought so highly of <b>Wythe</b> that he wrote 'Thoughts on Government' concerning establishing constitutions for state governments after the war. Earlier in the session, <b>Wythe</b> also exchanged humorous verses with his friend delegate William Ellery of Rhode Island despite their political differences. <b>Wythe</b> thus signed the Declaration of Independence upon his (and his wife's) return to Philadelphia in September. The signers' names were not made public until the following January, for all knew the declaration was an act of treason, punishable by death should their rebellion fail.|$|E

25|$|In 1779, Governor Jefferson {{appointed}} <b>Wythe</b> to {{the newly}} created Chair of Law and Police, making <b>Wythe</b> the first law professor in the United States. As a law professor, <b>Wythe</b> introduced a lecture system based on the Commentaries published by William Blackstone, as well as Matthew Bacon's New Abridgement of the Law, and Acts of Virginia's Assembly. <b>Wythe</b> also developed experiential tools, including moot courts and mock legislative sessions, which tools are still used today. However, apprenticeship remained the main mode of learning law in that era, followed by examination before several practicing lawyers. Thus, not only did Marshall and Monroe attend Wythe's lectures for a time, they also affiliated themselves with more experienced lawyers before being admitted to the bar. The college suspended classes during the later days of the revolutionary war, after which <b>Wythe</b> both taught in Williamsburg and performed his duties as judge (mostly in Richmond as the new capital) until the 1788–1789 term. <b>Wythe</b> then resigned from the college and announced {{that he planned to}} move to Richmond to concentrate on his judicial duties. Travel to the new capital for the four judicial sessions each year may have become onerous, many of Wythe's friends and colleagues had died or moved, and Williamsburg's intellectual and cultural life had also declined after the state capital moved upriver.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} carried out to develop a Precast Lightweight Foamed Concrete Sandwich Panel, PLFP, as a new and {{affordable}} building system. Experimental investigation to study the behaviour of the panel under axial load is undertaken. The panel consists of two lightweight foamed concrete <b>wythes</b> and a polystyrene insulation layer in between the <b>wythes.</b> The concrete panels are reinforced with 9 mm diameter high tensile steel bars. The rebars are tied to {{each other through the}} insulation layer by shear connectors which are made of 6 mm mild steel bars bent to 45 º angle. Total number of four specimens was tested with one specimen; PA 1 was cast without capping at both ends. It was used as a pilot test. The other three specimens are capped with normal concrete at both ends to avoid end crushing during axial loading. Axial load test was conducted and the results are presented here, which include the ultimate load capacity, crack pattern and failure mode, strain distribution and load-deflection curve of the panels. The experimental ultimate strength achieved recorded lesser percentage difference with the formulae by Pillai and Parthasarathy when compared to formulae in BS 8110. It is also observed that the strength of the panels are affected by the compressive strength of the foamed concrete forming the <b>wythes,</b> the presence of concrete capping at panel’s ends and the slenderness ratio, H/t. Specimens with capping at both ends recorded higher ultimate loads with no premature crushing. Failure of panels with slenderness ratio, H/t < 18 were by premature buckling near the supports whereas for panels with higher H/t ratio, slight bending was observed in the middle zone. The results also indicate that a certain degree of compositeness is achieved between the <b>wythes...</b>|$|R
