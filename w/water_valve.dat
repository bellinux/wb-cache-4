40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{software}} {{design and implementation}} of automated control system for test device is discussed. The device will serve for tests of drinking <b>water</b> <b>valves.</b> As regards the control and software design, the important parts are identified and their functions are discussed in details. As part of software design, the basic system structure and it`s modules` functions are described using UML diagrams. Because of implementation reasons, ways of communication – such as M-BUS are described; as well as acquiring, processing and writing data to output. User interface created in LabVIEW is created as well. All mentioned application blocks were implemented. In addition, in this paper there is overview of testing methods for drinking <b>water</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and <b>water</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some VAV boxes {{also have}} hot <b>water</b> <b>valves</b> and an {{internal}} heat exchanger. The valves for {{hot and cold}} water are opened or closed based on the heat demand for the spaces it is supplying. These heated VAV boxes are sometimes used on the perimeter only and the interior zones are cooling only.|$|R
40|$|Water medium {{hydraulic}} systems {{are widely used}} in coal mining machinery. As the power of hydraulic system becomes higher, the flow and pressure of <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve</b> are also higher, and the flow may reach 2000 L/min. However, there is no relevant test-bed which could provide instantaneous high-pressure and high-flow to support the experiment for high-flow relief valve; consequently, this impact test-bed for high-flow <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve</b> is designed to satisfy fast loading demand. Through building model, simulation analysis, and construction of an impact test-bed of high-flow <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve,</b> the dynamic performance of high-flow <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve</b> is detected. The setting pressure of relief valve, the accumulator volume and the filling fluid pressure, and the damping of cartridge valve can be changed, and the dynamic performance of high-flow <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve</b> under different impact loads is detected. The {{results show that the}} designed impact test-bed of high-flow <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve</b> could provide required high-pressure and high-flow emulsion for the tested <b>water</b> medium relief <b>valve,</b> and it could control the strength of impact load, which is an energy saving, high efficiency, and low cost method...|$|R

50|$|A water key is a valve or tap used {{to allow}} the {{drainage}} of accumulated fluid, consisting of condensed breath moisture, from musical instruments such as trombones or trumpets. It is otherwise known as a <b>water</b> <b>valve</b> or, less euphemistically, a spit valve. In valved instruments, they are found always on the main tuning slide, and sometimes on valve slides. On the trombone, {{it is on the}} downwind side of the bend in the hand slide. Baritone saxophones have a water key {{at the bottom of the}} loop at the top of the instrument.|$|E
50|$|Analog or digital {{temperature}} sensors may {{be placed in}} the space or room, the return and supply air ducts, and sometimes the external air.

50|$|For example, a {{building}} owner may {{find evidence of}} a leak in his building. Rather than exploring the physical building, he may turn to the model and see that a <b>water</b> <b>valve</b> {{is located in the}} suspect location. He could also have in the model the specific valve size, manufacturer, part number, and any other information ever researched in the past, pending adequate computing power. Such problems were initially addressed by Leite and Akinci when developing a vulnerability representation of facility contents and threats for supporting the identification of vulnerabilities in building emergencies.|$|E
5000|$|The Johnson Electric Service Company was {{established}} in 1885 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Johnson’s most notable contribution to temperature control was the automatic multi-zone temperature control system - a pneumatic system that used a bi-metal thermostat to control air flow through a nozzle and thereby operate a pilot regulator. The amplified air signal from the regulator was then used to control a steam or hot <b>water</b> <b>valve</b> on a heat exchanger, or to control a damper of a forced air system. He received a patent for the system in 1895.|$|E
5000|$|Internal mixing guns have {{a chamber}} {{where the water}} and air are mixed {{together}} and forced through jets or through holes and {{fall to the ground}} as snow. These guns are typically low to the ground on a frame or tripod and require a lot of air to compensate for the short hang time (time the water is airborne). Some newer guns are built in a tower form and use much less air because of the increased hang time. The amount of water flow determines the type of snow that is to be made and is controlled by an adjustable <b>water</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{fuel cell}} power system {{for use in}} a weightless environment, such as in space, {{includes}} a device for removing water from a water-hydrogen mixture condensed from the exhaust from the fuel cell power section of the system. Water is removed from the mixture in a centrifugal separator, and is fed into a holding, pressure operated <b>water</b> discharge <b>valve</b> via a Pitot tube. Entrained nondissolved hydrogen is removed from the Pitot tube by a bleed orifice in the Pitot tube before the water reaches the <b>water</b> discharge <b>valve.</b> <b>Water</b> discharged from the valve thus has a substantially reduced hydrogen content...|$|R

50|$|In 2003, driver {{support was}} added to HS1 for Z-Wave, a {{wireless}} mesh network technology. At that time, the technology was in its infancy with {{only a handful of}} lighting products available from Advanced Control Technologies and Sylvania. As of 2015, the Z-Wave Alliance reported there were more than 1,400 Z-Wave certified products including light switches, thermostats, door locks, <b>water</b> <b>valves,</b> garage door controllers, sensors and other products.|$|R
5000|$|In areas {{subject to}} {{freezing}} temperatures, {{only a portion}} of the hydrant is above ground. The valve is located below the frost line and connected by a [...] to the above-ground portion. A valve rod extends from the valve up through a seal {{at the top of the}} hydrant, where it can be operated with the proper wrench. This design is known as a [...] "dry barrel" [...] hydrant, in that the barrel, or vertical body of the hydrant, is normally dry. A drain valve underground opens when the <b>water</b> <b>valve</b> is completely closed; this allows all water to drain from the hydrant body to prevent the hydrant from freezing.|$|E
50|$|Operation {{required}} several valves; {{when the}} reservoir was empty {{at the start}} of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling <b>water</b> <b>valve</b> turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet. This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.|$|E
5000|$|Alcan {{failed to}} live up to its side of the 1987 {{settlement}} agreement. There were delays in construction of the cold <b>water</b> <b>valve.</b> At first the water in the reservoir was too cold and contained too much nitrogen, while not enough oxygen. in order to create the correct balance, Alcan needed to draw water from both the centre and the surface of the reservoir, then run the water through [...] "a hallow cone valve and over a baffle-clock spillway to reduce the amount of nitrogen". Second delays in the construction were due to a decrease in the demand of aluminum and a decrease in the economy. By 1992 the cold water release valve had yet to be built.|$|E
5000|$|The less {{efficient}} type of air-handler is a [...] "constant volume air handling unit," [...] or CAV. The fans in CAVs {{do not have}} variable-speed controls. Instead, CAVs open and close dampers and water-supply valves to maintain temperatures in the building's spaces. They heat or cool the spaces by opening or closing chilled or hot <b>water</b> <b>valves</b> that feed their internal heat exchangers. Generally one CAV serves several spaces.|$|R
