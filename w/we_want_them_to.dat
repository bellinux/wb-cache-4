On 5 March 2013, Aram Sargsyan {{was asked}} about his brother's political stance, to which he responded, [...] "I {{would very much like}} to ask Vazgen that question. I don't know what he would have answered. I don't know Vazgen's answers to very few questions. Unfortunately, our friends and relatives are not always the way <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be. I am not the first one, neither am I the last one; {{the history of the world}} is full of such examples starting from the Bible." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 21, 2008, timed to coincide with Halloween. The album was made available as a two-disc set, with audio tracks on one in CD format and video recording of the live performance on the other in DVD format. The DVD contains a live video recording of the performance, without special features or DVD extras. The packaging also included a 20-panel booklet featuring photographs of the group performing, taken by their fans. Wednesday 13 commented, [...] "This release is for the fans and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> feel like {{they are part of}} everything we do." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... the way <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be". Pekka's vocals {{would continue to be}} recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] best that I have ever managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E
5000|$|Brian Weitz {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Sound to Sound, [...] "Pretty early on in the mixing we realised we were gonna have to find the middle ground, so we would do three mixes, where the vocals would be where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be, then one louder where Ben <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be and then one even lower than where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be, just in case we changed our mind. It was very, very rare that we went with the loud vocal version. ‘Summertime Clothes’ is the biggest example of where we disagreed. Even after we finished the record we were still thinking maybe the vocals are too loud on that song. And Ben felt the opposite way." ...|$|R
60|$|The engine {{had hardly}} stopped when I {{jumped on the}} running-board on one side, while Jim mounted the other. As soon as the {{engineer}} and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told, and begged us not to shoot, saying they would do anything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} did not {{accompany}} the song which was {{unusual for a}} hit record in the 1990s. Diffie told the Chicago Tribune that the decision happened by design. [...] "We told people in radio that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have the first shot at the music and I think they were appreciative of that." ...|$|R
500|$|The Cartosat-2D weighs , and {{its design}} life is five years. The two Indian nanosatellites, {{designated}} INS-1A and INS-1B, each carried two payloads from ISRO's Space Applications Centre and the Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems. INS-1A carried a Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Radiometer (SBR) and a Single Event Upset Monitor (SEUM). INS-1B carried an Earth Exosphere Lyman-Alpha Analyzer (EELA) and Origami Camera as payloads. They weigh [...] and [...] respectively {{and have been}} designed with a mission life of six months. An ISRO official said: [...] "The nano satellites are an experimental class of satellites introduced by ISRO because there are requests from academic institutions to use them for data collection. The universities {{do not have the}} knowledge to build satellites and tend to take a long time… <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> focus on the instruments as we can provide the nano satellite bus." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> move in our digital environment." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E
5000|$|These {{kinds of}} shows are {{made as a}} {{collaborative}} effort. Everyone did everything, which is {{a wonderful way to}} work. I mean, everyone's totally involved, everyone cares. Though they were seven-day shows and the titles were exploitative, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be the very best we could possibly make them. — Bernard L. Kowalski ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} self-produced by {{the band and}} {{released}} in April 2012. In an interview, vocalists Marjana Semkina discussed the techniques used to record the album stating [...] "I won’t reveal the backstage stories too much…because {{a lot of people}} would be terrified if they knew how we recorded certain things" [...] referring to the subpar conditions under which the album was recorded, maintaining that [...] "at least I know that we did our best". On the title of the album Semkina described the tilde as [...] "a powerful symbol. It brings us certain associations but all of them are more or less neutral. It’s difficult to keep things clear of additional emotional coloring. <b>We</b> didn’t <b>want</b> people to have any feelings about our album before they got to listen <b>to</b> it. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be objective. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> judge us by our music." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeff {{is known}} for his dim-lit, close-up, long shot filming as shown in Fight Club {{including}} many of the music videos and commercials he has worked on. As he says of Fight Club, [...] "Whether we were inside or outside, <b>we</b> always <b>wanted</b> to keep a shallow depth of field to keep the audience focused on what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Oktar {{expressed}} his new views on Jews {{in his own}} words, [...] "hatred or anger toward {{the line of the}} Prophet Abraham is completely unacceptable. The Prophet Abraham is our ancestor, and the Jews are our brothers. We want the descendants of the Prophet Abraham to live in the easiest, pleasantest and most peaceful manner. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be free to perform their religious obligations, to live as they wish in the lands of their forebears and to frequently remember Allah in comfort and security." ...|$|E
2500|$|Resnicoff is {{frequently}} quoted {{on the impact}} of war and violence on the human spirit, including the distinction he makes between [...] "outrage", a feeling we must value, because it is part of being human (and we must fight against the danger that war and violence can numb us against it), and [...] "rage", where emotions take over, we lose our moral compass, and we become vulnerable to manipulation by others who want us to lose our way. [...] While working for General Wesley K. Clark at the U.S. European Command, Resnicoff worked to expand the concept of force protection to include Spiritual Force Protection: protecting military personnel not only against physical danger, but against threats to their humanity, as well. The book, Stoic Warriors: The Ancient Philosophy Behind the Military Mind quotes his position that [...] "We don't want our people just to come home physically; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come back as close to the human beings they were before they went in." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, Nichols {{became the}} first NCAA {{coordinator}} of officials. [...] He spent 22 years in that position. Nichols said, [...] "the goal {{was to try to}} get guys across the country to officiate the same way, not have the ACC be different from the Big Ten and the Big Ten different from the Pac-10. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to teach guys to ref better, to try <b>to</b> get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be more consistent. <b>We</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be another factor when teams played on the road. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stand tall and figure out tough situations. I think a lot of that has been accomplished." [...] While in this position, Nichols also was the secretary/editor of the Basketball Rules Committee from 1991-1997.|$|R
5000|$|Broken Rites said: [...] "Sorry {{may be a}} start but <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{to see a lot}} more. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> {{the victims}} to be treated fairly, <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> feel that they have been shut out, <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be re-abused by church authorities." [...] It {{reported}} that there were 107 Catholic priests and religious brothers sentenced in Australian courts on sex charges, and that in 2002, Australian bishops had already apologised for past abuses.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{talking of}} doing that," [...] put in May Powell. [...] "You see, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{come up to}} my house first, and then Ruth <b>wanted</b> <b>them.</b> But as their mothers are now all alone in New York they thought it best that we should spend the time down there. We could have {{something}} of a house party, and that would help cheer the older folks up." ...|$|R
2500|$|TTP {{spokesman}} Muhammad Omar Khorasani {{said that}} [...] "we targeted the school because the Army targets our families. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> feel our pain.", [...] "Our six fighters successfully entered the Army school {{and we are}} giving them instructions from outside," [...] said Khorasani by phone. Khorasani also said [...] "Our suicide bombers have entered the school, they have instructions not to harm the children, but to target the Army personnel. It's a revenge attack for the Army offensive in North Waziristan." [...] Later though the Taliban claimed contrary by putting out a statement saying, [...] "More than 50 sons of important army officers were killed after being identified." [...] The attacks were mainly coordinated by TTP leaders operating in Afghanistan. [...] According to the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency or FIA's early investigations, the group was led by the terrorist, Abu Shamil who planned the attacks, accompanied by three Arabs and two Afghans who spoke Pashto and were from Eastern Afghanistan. Khorasani was later killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan on 9 July 2016.|$|E
2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want to feel that they are among us and yet not really part of us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Benny Morris, documents show that Jabotinsky favored {{the idea of}} the transfer of Arab populations if required for establishing a (still-proposed) Jewish state. Jabotinsky's other writings state, [...] "We do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the Jordan River. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> prosper both economically and culturally. We envision the regime of Jewish Palestine [...] as follows: most of the population will be Jewish, but equal rights for all Arab citizens will not only be guaranteed, they will also be fulfilled." [...] Jabotinsky was convinced {{that there was no way}} for the Jews to regain any part of Palestine without opposition from the Arabs. In 1934, he wrote a draft constitution for the Jewish state which declared that Arabs would be on an equal footing with their Jewish counterparts [...] "throughout all sectors of the country's public life." [...] The two communities would share the state's duties, both military and civil service, and enjoy its prerogatives. Jabotinsky proposed that Hebrew and Arabic should enjoy equal status, and that [...] "in every cabinet where the prime minister is a Jew, the vice-premiership shall be offered to an Arab and vice versa." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We were {{a little}} uncomfortable at first about using {{slightly}} older material, and I think if we'd done the album as a 4 piece, we wouldn't have used them. Having Dan join the band really revived those songs though, the arrangements have been bettered. We can now obviously do the songs justice with Dan's voice, they now sound the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sound before, and <b>we</b> definitely <b>want</b> more people to hear them!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The video {{shows the}} band {{playing in the}} York House Gardens in London, England. The band also wears masks, {{which is similar to}} the concept of the Pornography album. Robert Smith recalled: [...] "For the 'Hanging Garden' video we got two people who did Madness videos but it was a really awful video. They wanted to make us look serious and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> make us look like Madness". The video was {{directed}} by Chris Gabrin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty close," [...] he said. [...] "Come on as {{cautious}} as you can. The reservation's not far away, and <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{get there}} much before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be serious. Well, a room or two must content us at first, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be decent, {{not to say}} {{pretty and}} comfortable, don't we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Gav saw an objection. [...] "The feck of them," [...] {{he pointed}} out, [...] "will waur their siller on shows and things to eat, {{instead of on}} what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> buy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell her, that if {{she will}} send her tribe to us, we will do them no harm. We are going over the {{mountains}} to fight the Spaniards, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> show us the way." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the release}} of Emotion Is Dead, Tooth & Nail and The Juliana Theory clashed heads in terms of {{creative}} and promotional areas of the group's marketing. [...] "Most things that we asked <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do for us they couldn't do or didn't do. Now, almost everything we asked for at the time is just protocol for the label. They {{do all of the}} stuff <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do back then very well now." [...] The group left to find a new label shortly afterwards.|$|R
25|$|The {{separation}} axioms {{are about}} the use of topological means to distinguish disjoint sets and distinct points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space to be distinct (that is, unequal); <b>we</b> may <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be topologically distinguishable. Similarly, it's not enough for subsets of a topological space to be disjoint; <b>we</b> may <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be separated (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know he has}} not {{a shadow}} of a chance," [...] said Lady Bardolf. [...] "Ah! what changes we have seen in that family! They say the writ of right killed poor Lord de Mowbray, but to my mind he never {{recovered}} the burning of the Castle. We went over <b>to</b> <b>them</b> directly, and I never saw a man so cut up. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come to us at Firebrace, but he said he should leave the county immediately.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a problem Kiley (2005) {{and others have}} noted is endemic to Australian universities. In 2007, we look the first small practical steps to address {{the difficult task of}} drawing honours and postgraduate students of literature into the research culture of their discipline. Our focus was a conference we organised and that took place in July 2007. We chose keynotes who are not only internationally pre-eminent in their fields of literary theory and criticism, but have also participated in the recent wars that have surrounded the teaching of literature in the universities. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to offer our students the opportunity to be more than awestruck listeners at the feet of Great Men; <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be conference-ready so they would engage directly with the new research that would be presented; <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> experience a level of intellectual excitement that might feed into their own work. To that end, we set up a number of formal and informal enabling structures that brought groups of students and staff together in ways that included an informal reading group, a formal honours course based on the keynotes’ work, and how-to-write-and present- a-paper workshops for postgraduates. All were geared to the conference and fed into it as they fostered students’ awareness that they belong to, indeed are essential to, an ongoing vital research community. Our next step is to encourage and facilitate others who might wish to adopt and adapt these strategies...|$|R
