5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It {{takes the form of a}} traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a <b>warning</b> <b>against,</b> that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Written {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was {{an employee of the}} Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have found it to be pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that men should join the military to please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> accepting the Defenders of the Homeland as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book.|$|E

5|$|Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, {{argues that}} the play is a veiled <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> {{considering}} PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would {{have been aware of}} the Japanese occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message which had to be conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, and suggests that the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset and the accompanying manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear of the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue, <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.|$|E

He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent of the CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Chanchu {{affected}} several islands with strong winds and heavy rainfall. In Legazpi, Albay, strong waves wrecked 100homes and left 1,500people homeless. High winds left widespread power outages, particularly in Mindoro, Batangas, and across the Bicol Region. The storm severely damaged the banana industry and affected various other fruit crops. Near Metro Manila, the winds damaged billboards, knocked over trees, and caused isolated power outages. Rough seas sank a ferry off Masbate, despite a <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> the operation of small craft, having left at sunrise to avoid the police. The Coast Guard rescued 18passengers, but 28people died in the wreck. An empty ferry sank at port in Tabaco. A ferry with 700people aboard went missing, but the Coast Guard found it washed ashore with everyone safe on board. Similarly, an oil tanker washed ashore at Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, and its crew of 13 was rescued. Throughout the country, Chanchu killed 41people, mostly from the Masabate ferry wreck. The storm damaged 5,630homes, and destroyed 1,013others, forcing 53,307people to leave their homes. Agricultural losses totaled ₱71.57million (PHP, $1.3million USD), chiefly to the corn harvest, with an additional ₱46million (PHP, $850,000 USD) in infrastructure damage.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was {{declared}} a protected area within {{the meaning of}} the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia, and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman {{in the hope that the}} Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca <b>warning</b> <b>against</b> trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E
