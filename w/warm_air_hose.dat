50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: <b>air</b> <b>hose,</b> <b>air</b> inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> and <b>air</b> inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

50|$|Warm fronts occur {{where the}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold <b>air</b> mass. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> overrides the cooler air and moves upward. Warm fronts {{are followed by}} extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|R
5000|$|Thermals {{are caused}} by local {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, or impurity concentration in the vertical. Temperature differences can cause <b>air</b> currents because <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cooler <b>air,</b> causing the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> to appear [...] "lighter." [...] Thus, if the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is under the cool air, air currents will form as they exchange places. Air currents are caused because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.|$|R

50|$|The {{pressure}} drop in the length of <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> connecting the blower to the instrument is important when determining blow output requirements. Some systems have one blower unit providing air to two electronic instruments. In order to maintain equality in pressure, the hose lengths must be equal.|$|R

50|$|The {{boundary}} layer {{is the part}} of the atmosphere which is closest to the ground. Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it. Thermals form when this <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises into the cold <b>air</b> (<b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cold air), a process described by convection. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation, since condensation occurs as the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises and cools.|$|R
