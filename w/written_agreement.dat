5|$|Scorsese's complex filmmaking {{commitments}} to multiple film projects {{resulted in an}} early legal challenge before filming of Silence could be initiated. In August 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures sued Scorsese over an alleged breach of contract agreements related to Silence. According to the company, in 1990 Scorsese signed a <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> to direct Silence. Scorsese was supposed to shoot the film following 1997's Kundun, and Cecchi Gori Pictures had apparently invested more than $750,000 for this purpose. However, Scorsese chose to make Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, and The Aviator first.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E
5|$|With the {{question}} of the episcopal exemption decided in Evesham's favour, the alliance between Norreis and his monks dissolved. The monks again complained of their abbot's behaviour to the new papal legate, John of Sancta Maria. The legate ordered an investigation, the result being a <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> between the two parties. Norreis gave gifts to the legate's nephew, refused to sign the agreement, and took revenge on his opponents by expelling Thomas of Marlborough and his allies from the monastery. Thirty monks followed Thomas into exile, and Norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by the monks. A compromise was eventually reached, Norreis agreeing that the revenues of the abbey would be split with the monks, that officials of the abbey would be appointed by the abbot but with the advice and consent of the monks, and that the abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking the counsel of his monks nor dispose of the monastic property without the consent of his subordinates. Although the issue of the monks' support was temporarily solved, the issue of the disputed properties between Mauger and the monastery continued. Norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with the bishop, but the monks refused.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{decision-making}} is through {{local and regional}} plenaries (or plenary assemblies), and congresses, in which industry and various posts unions take active part sending delegations with previously reached and <b>written</b> <b>agreements.</b> The National Plenary does not follow this rule, as {{in this case the}} delegations with the <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> come from the regional confederations.|$|R

25|$|On June 22, in {{addition}} to agreeing to the lockout, the mine owners signed a secret <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> to maintain a unified front against the union.

25|$|In May 2012, Mark Rappaport filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carney for refusing to give back digital masters of Rappaport's movies which the filmmaker had {{previously}} entrusted to Carney to transport to Paris. Carney, however, has maintained that Rappaport actually gave him the masters as gifts and is now engaging in cyber bullying against him. No <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed when the material was shipped to Carney. The suit was dropped in September of that same year, due to rising legal costs, although Rappaport later started an online petition demanding that Carney return the masters.|$|E

This is the earliest surviving <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> between an English king and a Welsh ruler, and under its terms Llywelyn was to swear fealty and do homage to the king. In return, it confirmed Llywelyn's possession of his conquests and allowed cases relating to lands claimed by Llywelyn to be heard under Welsh law.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary {{signed a}} <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> {{confirming}} {{the results of}} an earlier Reichstadt Agreement in July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies running high throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.|$|E

25|$|The two {{researchers}} (both chief physicians at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, {{one of them}} {{married to}} Gillberg), defended their decision to shred the files by referring to the promises of confidentiality that had been issued to the subjects {{of the study and}} the letters of objection that had been received from the families that they did not want their personal data used or shared with the private individuals. They argued that turning the files over would have exposed the researchers and the university to potential lawsuits from the subjects for failing to honor a <b>written</b> <b>agreement.</b> They were convicted and fined for destruction of government property.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 1898, {{while in}} exile, Aguinaldo had {{a private meeting}} in Singapore with United States Consul E. Spencer Pratt, after which he decided to again take up the mantle of {{leadership}} in the Philippine Revolution. According to Aguinaldo, Pratt had communicated with Commodore George Dewey (commander of the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy) by telegram, and passed assurances from Dewey to Aguinaldo that the United States would recognize {{the independence of the}} Philippines under the protection of the United States Navy. Pratt reportedly stated that there was no necessity for entering into a formal <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> because the word of the Admiral and of the United States Consul were equivalent to the official word of the United States government. With these assurances, Aguinaldo agreed to return to the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1876, Serbia, {{followed}} by Montenegro, {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Empire. In July and August, the ill-prepared and poorly equipped Serbian army helped by Russian volunteers failed to achieve offensive objectives but did manage to repulse the Ottoman offensive into Serbia. Meanwhile, Russia's Alexander II and Prince Gorchakov met Austria-Hungary's Franz Joseph I and Count Andrássy in the Reichstadt castle in Bohemia. No <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> was made, but during the discussions, Russia agreed to support Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Austria-Hungary, in exchange, agreed to support the return of Southern Bessarabia—lost by Russia during the Crimean War—and Russian annexation of the port of Batum {{on the east coast}} of the Black Sea. Bulgaria was to become autonomous (independent, according to the Russian records).|$|E

25|$|Nurse {{practitioners}} {{can legally}} examine patients, diagnose illnesses, prescribe medication, and provide treatments. Just under {{half of the}} country permits NPs the authority to practice on their own. In fact, 22 states (plus D.C.) give full practice authority to NPs. Thirty-eight states require NPs to have a <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> with a physician in order to provide care. Even with the formal agreement between physician and NPs, their practice is restricted in at least one domain (e.g., prescribing, treatment). Twelve of those states restrict NPs even more. In order for NP's to provide care to patients, they are required to be supervised or delegated by a physician. The states in the Pacific Northwest, the Mountain states, and in upper New England generally permit more freedom to NPs. Many states in the South are the most restrictive states.|$|E
25|$|The {{surrender}} of Nazareth was formalized in a <b>written</b> <b>agreement,</b> whereby the town's leaders agreed to cease hostilities {{in return for}} promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm {{would come to the}} civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement, Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city's Arabs. He refused, remarking that he was ‘shocked and horrified’ that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he, and also Chaim Laskov, had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior, he was relieved of his post, but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth's population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed his judgement up, fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war, Nazareth's population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.|$|E
25|$|There was no <b>written</b> <b>agreement</b> {{governing}} {{the terms of}} the partnership, and Brayne and Burbage soon fell out. Brayne, who was now childless, failed to revise his will to leave his interest in the Theatre to James Burbage's children, as he had promised to do, and Burbage failed to grant Brayne a half interest in the 21-year ground lease which he had signed with Giles Allen on 13 April 1576, and kept it solely in his own name. On 9 August 1577 an assignment of lease was drawn up, and on 22 May 1578 Burbage signed a bond in the amount of £400 requiring him to assign a half interest in the ground lease to Brayne, but this was never done. Brayne accused Burbage of double-dealing, and in the following month the partners submitted their dispute to arbitration by two friends, in the course of which Burbage struck Brayne and they fell to fisticuffs. On 12 July 1578 the arbitrators submitted the articles containing their decision, and both Burbage and Brayne signed bonds in the amount of £200 as a guarantee of performance.|$|E
