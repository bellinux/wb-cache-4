5|$|The Confederates {{continued}} their pursuit on July 25. However, all soldiers were soaked in cold hard rain, {{and by now}} <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> and thirsty. An ambush by Hayes' men brought the Confederate pursuit to a halt. Powell's cavalry brigade was used to drive the Confederates back. Crook was ordered to retreat north across the Potomac River, and the Confederates reoccupied Martinsville (in addition to controlling Winchester). While most of Averell's division camped at Hagerstown, Maryland, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry guarded a river crossing near Shepherdstown, West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
5|$|When you <b>were</b> <b>hungry,</b> {{you began}} to cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, {{you began to}} gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|The 20th Army under future defense {{minister}} Liang Guanglie, advanced north from Daxing County, {{and proceeded to}} the south of Tiananmen Square through Dahongmen, Yongdingmen and Zhengyangmen. At 2:00 am, about 880 soldiers from the 173rd Regiment, 58th Division of the 20th Army, were surrounded by tens of thousands of city residents outside the east gate of the Temple of Heaven in Chongwen District. About 300 were pinned against the outside wall of the Temple complex. When the regiment commander told the crowd that his troops <b>were</b> <b>hungry,</b> thirsty and tired, residents brought soda, snacks and fruit and escorted injured soldiers to the hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} was effectively concluded at the Battle of Cedar Creek (October 19, 1864). In a brilliant surprise attack at dawn, Early routed {{two-thirds of the}} Union army, but his troops <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> and exhausted and many fell out of their ranks to pillage the Union camp; Sheridan managed to rally his troops and defeat Early decisively. In late fall, Sheridan sent his infantry to assist Grant at Petersburg, with his cavalry arriving the following spring. Most of the men of Early's corps rejoined Lee at Petersburg in December, while Early remained to command a skeleton force until he was relieved of command in March 1865 after his defeat at the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Blücher's {{force was}} reduced to around 16,000 to 17,000 soldiers. Though he possessed 100 {{artillery}} pieces and the Gadebusch position was strong, the Prussian declined battle because his troops <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> and worn out by constant marching. He determined to fall back to the Hanseatic City-state of Lübeck, where he hoped to join a force of Swedes that he knew were in the area. The Prussian army appeared before neutral Lübeck {{on the morning of}} 5 November. At midday, they forced their way through the southern gate and occupied the city. Addressing the city senate in the Rathaus, Blücher demanded large amounts of food, drink, fodder, and currency for his army, but promised not to fight in the city.|$|E

25|$|These British {{military}} successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large {{force of}} French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched {{an attack against}} the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.|$|E

500|$|Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams and 16 policemen, Shippard {{arrived in}} mid-October 1888. The king {{suspended}} concession negotiations {{in favour of}} meetings with him. The colonial official told the king that the Boers <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted {{on behalf of a}} powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by Queen Victoria. Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. [...] "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [...] Stanley put on the Upper Congo...

500|$|Evading Beagle, Cofresí {{returned}} to Jobos Bay; on February 15, 1825, the pirates arrived in Fajardo. Three days later John Low {{picked up a}} six-gun sloop, Anne (commonly known by her Spanish name Ana or La Ana), which he had ordered from boat-builder Toribio Centeno and registered in St. Thomas. Centeno sailed the sloop to Fajardo, where he received permission to dock at Quebrada de Palmas in Naguabo. As its new owner Low accompanied him, remaining aboard while cargo was loaded. That night Cofresí led a group of eight pirates, stealthily boarded the ship and forced the crew to jump overboard; during the capture, Cofresí reportedly picked $20 from Low's pocket. Despite having to [...] "walk the plank", Low's crew survived and reported the assault to the governor of Saint Thomas. Low probably attracted the pirates' attention by docking near one of their hideouts; {{his work on the}} Beagle rankled, and they <b>were</b> <b>hungry</b> for revenge after the capture of Hernández Morales. Low met Centeno at his hacienda, where he told the Spaniard about the incident and later filed a formal complaint in Fajardo. Afterwards, he and his crew sailed to Saint Thomas. Although another account suggests that Cofresí bought Anne from Centeno for twice Low's price, legal documents verify that the builder was paid by Low. Days later, Cofresí led his pirates to the Humacao shipyard and they stole a cannon from a gunboat (ordered by Miguel de la Torre to pursue the pirates) which was under construction. The crew armed themselves with weapons found on the ships they boarded.|$|E

These church leaders sought to stem the tide toward enrolling in secular educational institutions. One of that founding group, Bishop George R. Brunk Sr., stated that “the world standard of education is self-centered, self-exalting, and materialistic.” By contrast, he advocated a form of Christian education that “expands and develops the God-given powers both natural and spiritual, guides them [...] into channels of activity most conducive to God’s glory and the blessing of mankind.” ...|$|E
