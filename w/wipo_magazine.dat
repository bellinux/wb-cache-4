There have, of course, been some important resolutions in the final text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, after extensive negotiations over the topic of tobacco control. The issue remains problematic. Rather than provide for complete protection of tobacco control measures, the Trans-Pacific Partnership instead offers limited and partial protection, particularly in respect of Investor-State Dispute Settlement. There is still scope for state-to-state dispute resolution in respect of tobacco control under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The text reaches quite an uneasy compromise in the end on intellectual property, trade, and tobacco control. Recommendation 1 Countries across the Pacific Rim should support and implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Recommendation 2 Countries involved in the Pacific Rim should follow the lead of Australia, and adopt graphic health warnings, and the plain packaging of tobacco products. New Zealand and Canada have been pressing ahead with such tobacco control measures, given the evidence from Australia about the efficacy of the regime. Recommendation 3 The Australian Government has successfully defended plain packaging of products, both in a constitutional case in the High Court of Australia, and in an investor-state dispute settlement matter with Philip Morris. The Australian Government is currently defending plain packaging of tobacco products in the World Trade Organization. Australia has made a strong case about the legitimacy of tobacco control measures – such as plain packaging of tobacco products – under international law. Recommendation 4 There is a need to protect tobacco control measures from possible intellectual property challenges under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, given Australia’s past experiences in domestic litigation and in the World Trade Organization. Recommendation 5 There is a long history of tobacco companies deploying investor clauses to challenge tobacco control measures – such as graphic health warnings and plain packaging of tobacco products. The Trans-Pacific Partnership provides protection against investor actions in respect of tobacco control measures – but only if nation states elect to do so. A broader exclusion for tobacco control would have been a better approach. Overall, it would have been preferable to excise the regime on investor-state dispute settlement from the Trans-Pacific Partnership altogether. Recommendation 6 There have been concerns about how Technical Barriers to Trade will operate in respect of tobacco control measures under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Recommendation 7 There remain larger concerns about the use of State-to-State dispute resolution in respect of tobacco control measures under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Recommendation 8 The World Health Organization remains concerned about how tobacco companies have sought to deploy intellectual property, investor clauses, and trade agreements against public health measures...|$|E
