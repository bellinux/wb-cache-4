40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} done with the CHEMKINsoftware to study different aspects of <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> in thecombustion of lean, laminar and premixed flames in anaxisymmetric boundary-layer flow. The importance of the chemical <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> compared to thethermal <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> caused {{by the development of}} the thermaland velocity boundary layer has been investigated in thereaction zone by using different wall boundary conditions, walltemperatures and fuel/air ratios. Surface mechanisms include acatalytic surface (Platinum), a surface that promotesrecombination of active intermediates and a completely inertwall with no species and reactions as the simplest possibleboundary condition. When hydrogen is the model fuel, the analysis of the resultsshow that for atmospheric pressure and a wall temperature of 600 K, the surface chemistry gives significant <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> atthe richer combustion case (f= 0. 5), while the thermal andvelocity boundary layer gives rather small effects. For theleaner combustion case (f= 0. 1) the thermal and velocityboundary layer gives more significant <b>wall</b> <b>effects,</b> whilesurface chemistry gives less significant <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> comparedto the other case. For methane as model fuel, the thermal and velocity boundarylayer gives significant <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> at the lower walltemperature (600 K), while surface chemistry gives rather smalleffects. The wall can then be modelled as chemically inert forthe lean mixtures used (f= 0. 2 and 0. 4). For the higher walltemperature (1200 K) the surface chemistry gives significantwall effects. For both model fuels, the catalytic wall unexpectedlyretards homogeneous combustion of the fuel more than the wallthat acts like a sink for active intermediates. This is due toproduct inhibition by catalytic combustion. For hydrogen thisoccurs at atmospheric pressure, but for methane only at thehigher wall temperature (1200 K) and the higher pressure (10 atm). As expected, the overall <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e. a lowerconversion) were more pronounced for the leaner fuel-air ratiosand at the lower wall temperatures. To estimate a possible discrepancy in flame position as aresult of neglecting the axial diffusion in the boundary layerassumption, calculations have been performed with PREMIX, alsoa part of the CHEMKIN software. With PREMIX, where axialdiffusion is considered, steady, laminar, one-dimensionalpremixed flames can be modelled. Results obtained with the sameinitial conditions as in the boundary layer calculations showthat for the richer mixtures at atmospheric pressure the axialdiffusion generally has a strong impact on the flame position,but in the other cases the axial diffusion may beneglected.

5000|$|Two newer {{aesthetic}} {{criticisms of}} the Radburn model emerged in the 1980s: {{the absence of a}} street [...] "wall" [...] or [...] "enclosure" [...] and the repetitiveness of housing unit forms as found in suburban districts. Both these criticisms can be understood as a misapplication of aesthetic norms on socio-economic outcomes. [...] The spaciousness of housing developments at the city's edge echoes the spaciousness of contemporary houses and are both driven not by aesthetic intent but by economic prosperity. [...] Judging the visual outcome of prosperity using historic streetscape criteria of cities with a different socioeconomic makeup would make the verdict predictable and practically meaningless.Moreover, the [...] "street wall" [...] and [...] "enclosure" [...] criticism of the Radburn pattern applications are undermined by observation of city districts new and old. Close examination would reveal that these spatial qualities are inextricably linked to housing unit and population density as well as construction technology and are not necessarily the outcome of a street pattern: The higher the habitation density of the street (and town) the closer and taller the buildings have to be to accommodate more people. A street pattern does not induce either unit density or the visual <b>wall</b> <b>effect.</b> For example, in earlier cities with labyrinthine street layouts, analogous to some contemporary suburban districts, residential buildings were agglutinated creating an entire perimeter wall around the city block with few perforations for reasons of security, safety and a heightened sense of privacy, not streetscape aesthetic. Conversely, early founded cities in North America, where land was almost free but construction costly, are depicted with generous lot dimensions and very small houses on them (e.g. Salt Lake City) that created a weak [...] "enclosure" [...] vertically and horizontally. At both ends of the streetscape scale, very proximate and very sparse buildings, socio-economic factors drive the outcome.Regarding repetitiveness of housing form, ground observation shows no relation to street pattern. Homogeneity correlates better with methods of production. Early agglutinated housing forms as in Pompeii and Tunis, with vastly different street patterns, presented no face on the street by which design differences could be discerned; plain and luxurious houses had the same nondescript, blank street face. In recent times, older streets of more recent cities with a grid show considerable replication, based on vernacular and pattern books, as do newer streets on the fringe, based on industrialization. What has impacted the urban landscape appreciably is the scale of production: many single operators in earlier periods with small yearly output versus few large corporations by mid-20th century with high annual production volumes. Inevitably, the larger the operation is, the greater the economies of repetition are. Similar house models can be found not only in the same subdivision but across states and even nations. For example, veterans housing that was built in Canada consists of two or three models that were repeated in neighbourhoods and across the country. The most impressive effect of large-scale production is starkly visible in Levittown, New York (1947) and in social housing projects, where the State also aims at economies of scale. In the case of early Huguenot settlements, sameness of houses on identical grid patterns was pursued as a means of expressing the social equality of all inhabitants - a community goal.|$|E

Initial {{validation of the}} technique was performed using lift-coefficient data in the linear lift range from tests of a large-scale STOVL fighter model in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) facility. The data from these tests served as an ideal database for validating the technique because the same model was tested in two wind tunnel test sections with widely different dimensions.

Furthermore, by systematically varying the tank size and sphere diameter, we examine the influence of increasing <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> on these guarded impact cavities and note the formation of surface undulations with wavelength λ =O(10) cm and acoustic waves λa=O(D 0) along the cavity interface, which produce multiple pinch-off points. Acoustic waves are initiated by pressure perturbations, which themselves are generated by the primary cavity pinch-off. Using high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques we study the bulk fluid flow for the most constrained geometry and show the larger undulations (λ =O (10 cm)) have a fixed nature with respect to the lab frame. We show that previously deduced scalings for the normalized (primary) pinch-off location (ratio of pinch-off depth to sphere depth at pinch-off time), Hp/H = 1 / 2, and pinch-off time, τ α (R 0 /g) 1 / 2, do not hold for these extended cavities in the presence of strong <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> (sphere-to-tank diameter ratio), ε = D 0 /Dtank 1 / 16. Instead, we find multiple distinct regimes for values of Hp/H as the observed undulations are induced above the first pinch-off point as the impact speed increases. We also report observations of 'kinked' pinch-off points and the suppression of downward facing jets in the presence of <b>wall</b> <b>effects.</b> Surprisingly, upward facing jets emanating from first cavity pinch-off points evolve into a 'flat' structure at high impact speeds, both in the presence and absence of <b>wall</b> <b>effects.</b> © 2014 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

In comparison with wedge-shaped chamber, chamber of annular cross section virtually eliminates such <b>wall</b> <b>effects</b> as electro-osmosis and transverse gradients of velocity.

40|$|Several {{questions}} {{that are relevant to}} turbulence modeling are addressed on the basis of recently obtained direct numerical simulation results of turbulent supersonic channel flow. In particular, this concerns the turbulence frequency production mechanism, <b>wall</b> damping <b>effects</b> on turbulence model parameters, and the relevance of compressibility effects. Limited support is found for usually applied models for the turbulence frequency production and <b>wall</b> damping <b>effects.</b> In contrast to that it is shown that turbulence frequency production mechanisms and <b>wall</b> damping <b>effects</b> may be explained very well {{on the basis of a}} frequency scaling that characterizes mean flow changes. The influence of compressibility is found to be relevant. ...|$|R
