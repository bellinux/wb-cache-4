25|$|Evans {{was born}} in Warrington, Lancashire, England, the {{youngest}} child of bookmaker and health authority <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> Martin Joseph Evans (1921–1979), and Minnie Beardsall, who managed a corner shop. His siblings are brother David (born 1953) and sister Diane (born 1963). He started his schooling at St Margaret's Church of England Infants and Junior School, and later the Junior School in Orford, Warrington. Evans' father and both paternal uncles died of colorectal cancer. Evans' mother is a breast cancer survivor.|$|E

30|$|The highest {{public-private}} ln <b>wage</b> differential for <b>clerks</b> {{is observed}} for Greece, Luxembourg, Latvia, Hungary and Portugal. These countries also have {{among the highest}} total-sample public-private ln wage gaps. Cyprus and Romania have a significantly lower public-private ln <b>wage</b> differential for <b>clerks</b> compared to the one estimated for the total sample. This may reflect more heterogeneous occupations {{in the private sector}} of these countries, a fact which may not be adequately captured by the available occupation controls. For example, in Romania, {{an important part of the}} private sector is related to low-paid primary occupations (around 30 % of total employment, the highest in the EU) which are not present in the public sector. We may then find a large wage gap in the total sample whereas, in the clerks’ sample, the gap may be insignificant if the remuneration of clerks in the two sectors is comparable. Unfortunately, we do not have enough observations in the sample to explore this issue further.|$|R
50|$|Once World War II commenced, Kathleen Culhane Lathbury {{offered her}} {{assistance}} {{to the war effort}} in 1939. She was first assigned to the position of an assistant <b>wages</b> <b>clerk,</b> but eventually, was appointed manager of a statistical quality control department at a Royal Ordnance Factory.|$|E
50|$|Watterson's early {{business}} career saw {{him work}} as a <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> {{and then as a}} car dealer. He was a salesman with the Sheffield-based Vauxhall dealers, Bentley Brothers, {{and was one of the}} first people in the country to sell the Vauxhall Viva when it was introduced in 1963.|$|E
50|$|For over 100 years - until 1976 - {{the company}} was based where the city hall is now situated. Gildemeisterstraße 60 in Bielefeld has since become the group’s headquarters. Today, 7,236 {{employees}} and 261 trainees work for the group worldwide. In 1890, the company had around 100 employees, among them a <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> and three technicians to assemble the machines.|$|E
50|$|The Superior Court of Santa Clara County is the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County, which {{includes}} the city of San Jose. The doctrine of Corporate personhood in US law is commonly traced to the 1886 decision of the United States Supreme Court in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, which started in this court. In August 2016, hundreds of clerks in the Santa Clara court system went on strike for better <b>wages.</b> One striking <b>clerk</b> {{had been living in}} a homeless shelter since November 2015.|$|R
40|$|After WWI, the Japanese economy {{experienced}} a structural change {{characterized by the}} emergence of large firms and increased numbers of white-collar workers. This paper explores how the human capital of white-collar workers was formed, using micro personnel data from Mitsubishi zaibatsu (business group). Applying the Mincer equation, we investigated the difference in <b>wage</b> structures for <b>clerks</b> and engineers. That is, while returns on formal education and work experience outside the firm and tenure in the firm were equivalent for engineers, for clerks, return on tenure was significantly higher than returns on formal education and work experience outside the fir...|$|R
60|$|Philip had {{encouraged}} ship building in Spain by {{grants from the}} crown, allowing four ducats a ton for every ship built of above three hundred tons burden, and six ducats a ton for every one above five hundred tons. Thus he had a large supply of great ships to draw upon {{in addition to those}} of the royal navy, while in England the largest vessels belonging to private owners did not exceed four hundred tons, and there were not {{more than two or three}} vessels of that size sailing from any port of the country. The total allowance by the queen for the repair of the whole of the royal navy, <b>wages</b> of shipwrights, <b>clerks,</b> carpenters, watchmen, cost of timber, and, all other necessary dockyard expenses, was but 4000 pounds a year.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 Taher Gass {{was convicted}} of murdering <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> Granville Jenkins. Gass was found insane and sent to Broadmoor; after his release he was {{deported}} to Somalia. In 1969 Harold Cover was convicted for the attempted murder of his daughter, using a razor. Mattan's middle son, Omar was found dead on a Scottish beach in 2003, and an open verdict was returned.|$|E
50|$|Beaver {{was born}} in Manly, New South Wales. He was educated at the Manly Public School and at the Sydney Boys' High School. He worked {{at a number of}} jobs, as a cow farmer, in radio, as a <b>wages</b> <b>clerk,</b> a surveyor's labourer, fruit-picker, proof-reader and journalist, before {{deciding}} to write full-time. From 1958 to 1962, he lived in New Zealand and Norfolk Island.|$|E
50|$|Before the robbery, Helfeld {{worked at}} the Schnurmann Rubber Factory in Chesnut Road, Tottenham, {{for a short period}} of time. While working there, Helfeld {{observed}} that the weekly collection of wages occurred every Saturday morning. Each week, the <b>wages</b> <b>clerk,</b> Albert Keyworth, aged 17, was taken in the factory owner's car by Joseph Wilson to a bank in South Hackney to collect about £80 in gold, silver and copper.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{seems to}} have sold out immediately, with initial sales to owners {{as far away as}} England and {{possibly}} Sweden and Hungary. At least some copies are known to have sold for 30 florins - about three years' <b>wages</b> for a <b>clerk.</b> [...] Although this made them significantly cheaper than manuscript Bibles, most students, priests or other people of ordinary income would have been unable to afford them. It is assumed that most were sold to monasteries, universities and particularly wealthy individuals. At present only one copy is known to have been privately owned in the fifteenth century. Some are known to have been used for communal readings in monastery refectories; others may have been for display rather than use, and a few were certainly used for study. [...] Kristian Jensen suggests that many copies were bought by wealthy and pious laypeople for donation to religious institutions.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} act, word {{comes to the}} {{department}} store owner Edward Gilder {{that one of his}} former sales clerks, Mary Turner, has been convicted for stealing and given a three-year prison sentence. Gilder is pleased because he had asked the judge to make her an [...] "example" [...] to other employees. Turner asks to speak with Gilder before she goes to prison. While Gilder waits for her arrival, his store detective detains another woman, a customer, for stealing. This woman is the wife of a prominent banker, so rather than have her arrested, Gilder apologizes to her and lets her go. Turner arrives and tells Gilder she has been wrongly convicted. Although she says she never stole, she pleads with Gilder to increase the <b>wages</b> of his <b>clerks,</b> so no one who works there will be forced to steal. Gilder rejects her arguments, and she leaves for prison swearing revenge on him for his treatment of her.|$|R
60|$|I {{was educated}} at Upper Canada College, Toronto, of which I was head boy in 1887. From there I {{went to the}} University of Toronto, where I {{graduated}} in 1891. At the University I spent my entire time in the acquisition of languages, living, dead, and half-dead, and knew nothing of the outside world. In this diligent pursuit of words I spent about sixteen hours of each day. Very soon after graduation I had forgotten the languages, and found myself intellectually bankrupt. In other words I was {{what is called a}} distinguished graduate, and, as such, I took to school teaching as the only trade I could find that need neither experience nor intellect. I spent my time from 1891 to 1899 on the staff of Upper Canada College, an experience which has left me with a profound sympathy for the many gifted and brilliant men who are compelled to spend their lives in the most dreary, the most thankless, and the worst paid profession in the world. I have noted that of my pupils, those who seemed the laziest and the least enamoured of books are now rising to eminence at the bar, in business, and in public life; the really promising boys who took all the prizes are now able with difficulty to earn the <b>wages</b> of a <b>clerk</b> in a summer hotel or a deck hand on a canal boat.|$|R
50|$|Littlejohn {{had been}} dishonourably {{discharged}} from the Parachute Regiment. He served three years for robbery before being released from prison in 1968 from which time {{he worked as a}} car dealer. In 1970 the Midland Motor Cylinder Company in Smethwick, Birmingham was robbed of £38,000. The <b>wages</b> <b>clerk,</b> Brian Perks, claimed to have been overpowered by an Indian man who then took the money. Perks was Littlejohn's brother-in-law and the police suspected a staged incident involving the two men.|$|E

50|$|In October 1839, Sutton was {{the scene}} of a serious riot. On {{completion}} of the works a gang of Irish navvies working from the Birkenhead end met with a gang of English & Welsh navvies working from the Chester end when the contractors' <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> for the Irish gang made off with the pay for his men. Violent fighting between the two gangs ensued over two days involving some 2,000 men; military were sent from Liverpool and Chester, including a piece of ordnance from Chester, and 28 rioters were jailed.|$|E

50|$|Watched by West Ham manager, Ted Fenton, {{and chief}} scout Wally St Pier, Lyall {{was offered a}} place at West Ham aged fifteen. In October 1955 he joined West Ham United as a groundstaff boy, with duties such as boot cleaning, {{painting}} the football stands and <b>wages</b> <b>clerk.</b> He played youth team football as a left back. In February 1957 he won his only significant international honour when he played for England Youth in a 7-1 victory over Luxembourg at Upton Park. In 1957 {{he was also a}} member of the West Ham side which lost 8-2, on aggregate, to Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup Final.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first to}} be {{appointed}} were Thomas Bannister the company secretary and salesman at ₤2-10-0 a week, John Taylor the chief overlooker and 'inside manager' at ₤2-2-0 a week. There were seven tacklers and then beamers and loomers. The book-keeper and <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> earned ₤1-4-0, the two labourers earned ₤1-2-0 while several cut-lookers (warehousemen) received ₤1-0-0. [...] When the bottom shop was vacated, an additional three tacklers, two beamers and a taper were employed. The number of weavers was not recorded in the directors' minutes, but {{there appear to be}} around 300. John Taylor was a director and shareholder but also an employee as were many others and it was this that made the 'Harle Syke model' unique.|$|E
50|$|Prime {{grew up in}} Staffordshire, and had a {{difficult}} childhood. After attending St. Joseph's College, Stoke-on-Trent, and achieving good O-levels in languages, he became a junior <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> at a factory. In 1956 he was selected for National Service in the Royal Air Force. Due to colour blindness he became a storeman in the RAF, but his linguistic abilities were recognised and {{he was sent to}} learn the Russian language at the Joint Services School for Linguists (JSSL) in Crail, Scotland. Prime excelled at Russian and was appointed an acting sergeant. He was enrolled on an advanced Russian course at the University of London, but failed the course after three months, and his rank was taken away from him. He resumed his duties as a storeman.|$|E
50|$|An {{incident}} occurred on 23 January 1909, {{which was at}} the time known as the Tottenham Outrage. Two armed robbers of Russian extraction held up the <b>wages</b> <b>clerk</b> of a rubber works in Chesnut Road. They made their getaway via Tottenham Marshes and fled across the Lea. On the opposite bank of the river they hijacked a Walthamstow Corporation tramcar, hotly pursued by the police on another tram. The hijacked tram was stopped but the robbers continued their flight on foot. After firing their weapons and killing two people, Ralph Joscelyne, aged 10, and PC William Tyler, they were eventually cornered by the police and shot themselves rather than be captured. Fourteen other people were wounded during the chase. The incident later became the subject of a silent film.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem now}} shifted, and writers {{had to write}} Ernie out but save his wife Emily. The {{decision}} was made for Ernest to be killed off in a bungled robbery at Mike Baldwin's factory, where {{he worked as a}} <b>wages</b> <b>clerk.</b> Ernest was killed by a single gunshot to the stomach on 11 January 1978. [...] It {{was the first time that}} violence on such a scale had been shown on Coronation Street and after the episode was aired, Granada's switchboard was jammed by angry viewers. Letters of complaint arrived in their hundreds, and the Lobby Against TV Violence fiercely objected Granada's decision to broadcast the episode. [...] Granada stated that the storyline was not about violence, but that it aimed to show the desolation and loss felt by Ernest's wife, Emily.|$|E
