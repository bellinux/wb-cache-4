His {{announcement}} that predistribution would become a cornerstone of the UK Labour Party's economic policy was jokingly mocked by Prime Minister David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of}} the Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and {{hesitant}} performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European beech (Fagus sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), {{as well as the}} buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E

25|$|After <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an 18-month {{struggle}} with {{the board of the}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Gabreski resigned on February 26, 1981.

However, a severe heat wave in the summer of 1980 that overwhelmed the commuter line's air conditioning systems was apparently the final straw that forced his resignation.|$|E
