5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the risk to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{civil war}} {{had broken out}} in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, {{resulting}} {{in a period of}} chaos known as the Anarchy. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, {{opened up the}} possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a German nuclear weapon project, and convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it. This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach of a leper.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of this life.|$|E
5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
5|$|By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars {{were six}} years old and the British Royal Navy was {{dominant}} at sea. Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France. These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in economic collapse, severe food shortages and social unrest. Messages <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent {{during the summer of}} 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.|$|E

5|$|For 10days, Myanmar's {{government}} did not report about the cyclone, which usually under-reports on storms that affect the country. There was also little to no advanced <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. The storm destroyed over 2,650homes and severely damaged another 1,385, leaving around 25,000people homeless, mostly in Pauktaw. Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged, including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations. About 300schools were damaged or destroyed, including 44 in Sittwe. The storm also damaged or destroyed 133religious buildings and 176government buildings. Across the region, high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply. About 2,000cattle were killed, and many rice mills were knocked down, causing a 70% increase of food prices. Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away, which contributed to food shortages, while damaged wells caused water shortages. During the storm, 84ships were lost at sea, {{in addition to a}} lost ocean liner, while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged, along with several fishing piers.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the storm dropped {{moderately}} heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides {{on the west}} coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7million (1959USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49ft (15m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|In the 1260s, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in the European perception of the Mongols, and they became regarded less as enemies, and more as potential allies {{in the fight against}} the Muslims. As recently as 1259, Pope Alexander IV had been encouraging a new crusade against the Mongols, and had been extremely disappointed in hearing that the monarchs of Antioch and Cilician Armenia had submitted to Mongol overlordship. Alexander had put the monarchs' cases on the agenda of his upcoming council, but died in 1261 just months before the Council could be convened, and before the new crusade could be launched. For a new pope, the choice fell to Pantaléon, the same Patriarch of Jerusalem who had earlier been <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongol threat. He took the name Pope Urban IV, and tried to raise money for a new crusade.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 {{discovery}} of nuclear fission in uranium, by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, {{raised the possibility}} that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. Refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries were particularly alarmed by {{the notion of a}} German nuclear weapon project. In the United States, three of them, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Albert Einstein, were moved to write the Einstein–Szilárd letter to United States President Roosevelt <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> danger. This led to the President creating the Advisory Committee on Uranium. In Britain, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg were sufficiently concerned to take up the matter. Their concerns reached the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay, who consulted with Sir Henry Tizard. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds against success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
