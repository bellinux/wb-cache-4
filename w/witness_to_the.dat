5|$|The niche image {{carved on}} the {{southwest}} wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wedding. Vishnu is <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma {{on the right side}} of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters hanging from the ceiling are seen blessing the wedding.|$|E

5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life.

5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} written by Nickie Wang for the Manila Standard Today on 25 March 2009, Boholano actor Cesar Montano {{mentioned}} that {{he was interested in}} producing a feature film on the Eskaya.

5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|Plante was the Canadiens' {{number one}} goaltender at the {{beginning}} of the 1954–55 NHL season. On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, Maurice Richard, for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riot that followed. It began at the Forum by angry hockey game spectators and spread along Montreal's Ste. Catherine Street, causing injuries to police and fans and extensive damage to businesses and property.

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{murder of a}} girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial.

There, they murder Tortilla, but find {{that he did not}} have the original fetish. Tintin arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los Dopicos, capital of San Theodoros.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Royton is linked closely with what was then its manor house, Royton Hall, which was {{inhabited}} by the Byron family for over 350years. During that period the Byrons' involvement in regional and national affairs added prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township. John de Byron was a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charter of incorporation of 1301, which elevated the township of Manchester {{to the status of}} a borough. A descendant of John—John Byron—served as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1572, and was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1579. John served as Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire {{at the time of the}} Spanish Armada, and sourced infantry from Royton towards the English military. His son, also called John, fought during the English Civil War on the side of the Cavaliers. His actions led to making him John Byron, 1st Baron Byron of Rochdale by way of a peerage granted by King Charles I. Following the regicide of Charles I, and the rise of Cromwellian England, Baron Byron's possessions, including his lands in Royton, were confiscated. Royton Hall was then purchased by Thomas Percival, a wealthy linen manufacturer whose descendants continued to occupy the hall until around 1814. The hall was then inherited by the Radcliffe Baronets.|$|E
