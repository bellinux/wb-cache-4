5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E

On 19 July Measure 12 had been prescribed {{for the entire}} Atlantic Fleet, and on 13 September Measure 11 for the Pacific. However, there was considerable time lag between the issuance of new instructions, and paint being manufactured and distributed and ships actually being repainted; {{at the time of}} the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7 most of the Pacific Fleet <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> dark gray Measure 1.|$|E

Zappa noted that one leg healed [...] "shorter than the other" [...] (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs [...] "Zomby Woof" [...] and [...] "Dancin' Fool"), resulting in chronic back pain. Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} campaign saw the UK's first televised debates between {{the leaders of}} the three main parties. While Cameron and Clegg were generally perceived to have performed well in these, Brown was perceived to have done less well. Brown also attracted criticism from the media after privately describing a 65-year-old pensioner as a [...] "bigoted woman" [...] after she stated that entitled people were not receiving benefits because non-entitled people are receiving them. She also expressed her displeasure at immigration from Eastern Europe.

500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man".|$|E

Having {{destroyed}} two of the German heavy fighters, Clisby's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit trailing smoke and flames, evidently hit by cannon fire. He was initially posted as [...] "missing", along {{with one of his}} comrades, Flying Officer Lorimer, whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action. The French later found two burnt-out Hurricanes in the vicinity, which were identified as [...] Clisby's and Lorimer's. Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC. A fellow pilot later said, [...] "He was an Australian and had thrown himself into the fray with a reckless abandon that was magnificent in its way".|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Warren was {{appointed}} the new school's first dean. Once again {{he found himself}} involved in creating a new medical school. His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester: Dr Charles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious disease; Dr. Andrew H. Dowdy as the first professor of radiology; and [...] Dr John S. Lawrence, who had pioneered the use of phosphorus-32 as a radioactive tracer, as professor of medicine. With Dr William P. Longmire Jr, a 34-year-old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery, they became the [...] "Founding Five" [...] of the new school. Initially, the new school was accommodated in wartime Quonset huts scattered about the UCLA campus. Warren <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> his army fatigues. Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949. By 1951 when the first students, 26 men and two women, arrived there were 15 faculty members. By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 [...] faculty members. The UCLA Medical Center opened in 1955.|$|E
500|$|Labour campaigned {{to secure}} a fourth {{consecutive}} term in office and to restore support lost since 1997, while the Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides, and possibly hold {{the balance of power}} in a hung parliament. After the televised debates between the three leaders–the first of their type during an election campaign in the United Kingdom–their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government. While Cameron and Clegg were generally well received by the viewers of the three debates, Brown's performance was considered to have been less successful. Brown's image was further harmed when he privately described Gillian Duffy, a 65-year-old pensioner, as a [...] "bigoted woman" [...] after she raised the issue of benefits and immigration with him during a campaign trip to Rochdale, Greater Manchester. His remarks were recorded by a Sky News microphone he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> as he was driven away from the visit, and were widely broadcast.|$|E

500|$|Astrid {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Voyage of the Damned". She is {{introduced}} aboard the starship Titanic as a waitress from the planet Sto with a dream of seeing the stars. Meeting the Tenth Doctor aboard Titanic, she quickly befriends him. She accompanies the Doctor (David Tennant) on a trip organised by Titanics resident historian, Mr Copper (Clive Swift), teleporting with some Titanic passengers down to Earth where she and the Doctor meet Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins). Upon their return to the ship, she and the Doctor discover the plan of Max Capricorn (George Costigan) to destroy the Titanic, its passengers and the nearby people of Earth with his villainous angelic robots, the Host. As they attempt to save the ship, Astrid grows increasingly fond of the Doctor, kissing him as part of what she assures is an [...] "old tradition" [...] on Sto. In the episode's climax, Astrid sacrifices herself to save the Doctor from Capricorn by driving Capricorn off a platform with a forklift truck and both appear to fall to their deaths. Later, realising Astrid <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> a teleporter bracelet, the Doctor attempts to recall her atoms {{in an attempt to}} resurrect her, but there is insufficient power aboard the damaged Titanic to do so. Astrid reappears spectral and bewildered, as the Doctor gives her a goodbye kiss before freeing her sentient atoms (described as [...] "stardust") to roam space as energy.|$|E

As in many other Dennison-related cases, no one was ever found guilty for their participation in the riot. A later grand jury hearing corroborated this claim, stating [...] "Several reported assaults on white women had actually been perpetrated by whites in blackface." [...] They went on to report that the riot was planned and begun by [...] "the vice element of the city." [...] The riot [...] "was not a casual affair; it was premeditated and planned by those secret and invisible forces that today are fighting you and the men who represent good government." ...|$|E

The Prince had changed into a Blues and Royals captain's frock coat also made by Kashket; his wife <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> her wedding dress. In a surprise organised by RAF Wattisham, the car was shadowed by a yellow Sea King helicopter flying the RAF Ensign from its winch cable, marking William's service as a pilot with the RAF Search and Rescue Force.|$|E

American comedian Jon Stewart commented that the clip showed the moment when Brown's [...] "political career leaves his body". Subsequently, Brown visited her house for 43 minutes in order to apologise in person. Upon emerging, he {{described himself as a}} [...] "penitent sinner", while Duffy refused to speak to the press and would not shake hands with him in front of the cameras. She said the incident had left her feeling more sad than angry and that she would not be voting for Labour or any other party. The incident was subsequently dubbed as [...] "Bigotgate".|$|E
2500|$|Cosby was in Los Angeles in January 1997, {{while on}} winter break from his classes at Columbia University.

He called a friend, Stephanie Crane, who drove to meet him; she parked behind him to light the area with her headlights while Cosby changed the tire. She later testified that a man came to her window and told her, [...] "Open the door or I'll kill you." [...] Frightened, Crane drove away but after approximately [...] turned her car around and came back. She saw a man running away and found Cosby lying on the ground {{in a pool of blood}} next to the driver's side of his dark green Mercedes-Benz. He had been shot in the head.

At her April 23, 2006, [...] "District Days" [...] event, Rep.

[...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross.
