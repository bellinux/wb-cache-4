5|$|On {{the morning}} of January 30, as Goebel and two friends <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets and blocked {{entrance}} to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E

Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found {{the doors to the}} state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E

25|$|When the {{cafeteria}} bombs failed to explode, Harris and Klebold convened and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the school. Both armed, they {{climbed to the}} top of the outdoor west entrance steps, placing them on a level with the athletic fields west of the building and the library inside the west entrance, directly above {{the cafeteria}}. From this vantage point, the cafeteria's west entrance was located at the bottom of the staircase, next to the senior parking lot.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, 1934 (election eve), {{a parade}} marched through the Village of Kelayres, Kline Township. A crowd of Democratic Party {{supporters}} <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the home of}} Republican Party leader, Joseph Bruno. Frustration with Bruno family control {{of the school board}} and other local offices had been growing for years. Shots were fired from the Bruno home and yard located at Fourth & Centre Streets. Several people were killed and more than 20 marchers were injured.|$|E
25|$|Utilizing {{available}} forensic data, Robert Graysmith {{postulated that}} another car {{pulled into the}} turnout, just prior to 11:00pm and parked beside the couple. The killer apparently exited the second car and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the Rambler, possibly ordering the couple out of the Rambler. Jensen appeared to have exited the car first, yet when Faraday was halfway out, the killer apparently shot Faraday in the head. Fleeing from the killer, Jensen was gunned down twenty-eight feet from the car with five shots through her back. The killer then drove off.|$|E

25|$|Huberty {{shot and}} killed a 62-year-old trucker named Laurence Versluis, before {{targeting}} one of the families near the play area of the restaurant, {{who had tried to}} shield their children beneath the tables with their bodies. Blythe Regan Herrera (aged 31) had shielded her 11-year-old son, Mateo, beneath one booth, and her husband protected 12-year-old Keith Thomas under a booth across from them. Huberty began shooting people seated in the restaurant as he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> those under the tables. Ronald Herrera urged Thomas not to move, shielding the boy with his body. Thomas was shot in the shoulder, arm, wrist, and left elbow, but was not seriously wounded; Ronald Herrera was shot eight times in the stomach, chest, arm, and head but survived; his wife, Blythe, and son, Mateo, were both killed by numerous gunshots to the head.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E

[...] became a commonplace term; being seen on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and advertising. The phrase represents Youkilis' nickname but also replicates the phonetic spelling of the low, drawn out, guttural cheer that Red Sox fans in attendance would greet Youkilis with as he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the batter's box prior to hitting or after a successful {{play in the}} field.|$|E

500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
500|$|For {{spacecraft}} interior shots, ostensibly {{containing a}} giant centrifuge that produces artificial gravity, Kubrick had a [...] rotating [...] "ferris wheel" [...] built by Vickers-Armstrong Engineering Group {{at a cost}} of $750,000. The set was [...] in diameter and [...] wide. Various scenes in the Discovery centrifuge were shot by securing set pieces within the wheel, then rotating it while the actor walked or ran in sync with its motion, keeping him {{at the bottom of the}} wheel as it turned. The camera could be fixed to the inside of the rotating wheel to show the actor walking completely [...] "around" [...] the set, or mounted in such a way that the wheel rotated independently of the stationary camera, as in the jogging scene where the camera appears to alternately precede and follow the running actor. The shots where the actors appear on opposite sides of the wheel required one of the actors to be strapped securely into place at the [...] "top" [...] of the wheel as it moved to allow the other actor to walk to the [...] "bottom" [...] of the wheel to join him. The most notable case is when Bowman enters the centrifuge from the central hub on a ladder, and joins Poole, who is eating on the other side of the centrifuge. This required Gary Lockwood to be strapped into a seat while Keir Dullea <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> him from the opposite side of the wheel as it turned with him.|$|E
500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E

2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs, very few of which detonated. Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened {{the first set of}} double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|E
2500|$|Carrying {{a bundle}} {{wrapped in a}} {{checkered}} blanket, Huberty looked toward his elder daughter, Zelia, as he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the front door of}} the family home and said, [...] "Goodbye.

According to eyewitnesses, he drove first toward the Big Bear supermarket and then toward the U.S. Post Office, before entering the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant located approximately 200yards from his apartment.|$|E

2500|$|In 873, {{in a grand}} ceremony, Emperor Yizong welcomed {{what was}} {{claimed to be a}} relic (a finger bone) of Gautama Buddha to the palace, despite {{warnings}} by some that his grandfather Emperor Xianzong died shortly after also welcoming the same relic to the palace. [...] (Emperor Yizong responded to the warnings by stating, [...] "As long as I can see it once while living, I do not have regrets about dying.") [...] The ceremony was said to bring out great offerings by the households of Chang'an. [...] Emperor Yizong himself <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the relic and bowed on the ground in tears.|$|E
2500|$|Entering the {{restaurant}} minutes later, Huberty first aimed his shotgun at a 16-year-old employee named John Arnold. The assistant manager, Guillermo Flores, shouted, [...] "Hey, John. That guy's {{going to shoot}} you." [...] According to Arnold, when Huberty pulled the trigger, [...] "nothing happened". As Huberty inspected his gun, the manager of {{the restaurant}}, 22-year-old Neva Caine, <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the service counter of the restaurant in the direction of Arnold, as Arnold—believing the incident to be a distasteful joke—began {{to walk away from the}} gunman. Huberty fired his shotgun toward the ceiling before aiming the Uzi at Caine, shooting her once beneath her left eye. Caine died minutes later.|$|E
2500|$|Around 5:00p.m., Lennon and Ono {{left the}} Dakota for a {{recording}} session at Record Plant Studios. As they <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> their limousine, Chapman {{shook hands with}} Lennon and asked for him to sign {{a copy of his}} album, Double Fantasy. Amateur photographer Paul Goresh took a photo of Lennon signing Chapman's album. [...] Chapman later {{said in an interview that}} he tried to get Goresh to stay, and that he asked another Lennon fan lingering at the building's entrance to go out with him that night. He suggested that if the girl had accepted his invitation, or the photographer had stayed, he would not have murdered Lennon that evening; but he probably would have tried another day.|$|E
