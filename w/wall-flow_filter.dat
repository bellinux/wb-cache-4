40|$|The present Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} the {{hydrogen}} production via a novel process involving a biogas autothermal reforming (ATR) unit with {{the adoption of a}} catalytic <b>wall-flow</b> <b>filter</b> located downstream from the ATR processor to effectively filter and in-situ gasify the carbon emissions eventually generated. This work was aimed to produce 50 Nm 3 /h of green hydrogen from the ATR of a model biogas (60 : 40 Vol ratio) by using catalytic structured supports. Moreover, a solution for the eventual carbon formation during the biogas ATR was addressed. A nanostructured delafossite catalyst to ensure the gasification of soot in absence of O 2 was synthesized. In addition, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a techno-economic analysis for the hydrogen production from biogas were also carried out. Concerning the identification of the suitable support structure to improve the coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions during the hydrogen production from biogas ATR, homogenous SiSiC lattices composed of Cubic, Octet and Kelvin cells and the Conventional Foam structure coated with Ni based catalysts doped with noble metals were investigated. The different catalytic geometries were tested using a model biogas composed of clean methane and carbon dioxide (60 : 40 Vol ratio) with a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) fixed at 2. 0. The effect of the space velocity, inlet temperature and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) on methane conversion and hydrogen yield were studied for each catalytic support. The O/C ratios evaluated was equal to 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2. Space velocity (GHSV) values from 2000 to 20000 h- 1 in standard conditions (equivalent to 5000 - 85000 h- 1 in operating conditions), and, inlet temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 °C were employed. The combined effect of chemical reaction and some properties and parameters such as: pressure drop and specific surface area on the steady-state performances of an adiabatic reactor at high flow rates has been analyzed. ASPEN simulations were performed to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium at the different boundary conditions to validate the data and to determine the hydrodynamic properties. This study has demonstrated that the rotated cubic cell support shows the best performance in transforming the biogas into hydrogen with high CH 4 conversion (< 95 %) and an H 2 yield higher of 2. 1 using an O/C ratio of 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2, S/C ratio of 2 and GHSV of 20000 h- 1. Besides, this support can ensure a high reliability of the ATR process due to its lower pressure drop (6 - 40 Pa/m) with the lower specific surface area comparing to the other structures tested. The conventional foam has presented also good performances for all the GHSV values in terms of CH 4 conversion but it is less selective for hydrogen production. With respect to the catalyst for gasification of carbon in a reducing atmosphere (H 2, CO, H 2 O, CO 2), nano-materials based on transition metal were synthesized via a solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. LiFeO 2 catalyst was selected as the most promising candidate for the soot gasification catalyst on the soot trap application close coupled to the ATR reactor for syngas post-treatment process. Afterwards, some issues in mixed atmosphere, i. e., when simultaneous carbon gasification with CO 2 and steam in the presence of H 2 and CO take place, were studied. It was demonstrated that the carbon gasification is inhibited during an isothermal reaction at 650 °C for 40 minutes when CO and H 2 are used as co-reagents. But even in these extreme reduced conditions, the LiFeO 2 -catalyst gasified 32. 9 % of the initial carbon, compared to 8 % for the non-catalytic case. when H 2 is used as co-reagent in the steam carbon gasification, the reaction is inhibited, the carbon conversion decreases from 73. 1 % to 46. 6 %. Analogously, when CO is a co-reactant in the carbon gasification with CO 2, the reaction is inhibited, the soot conversion declines from 70. 2 % to 31. 6 %. However, it was observed that in mixed atmosphere gasification reactions, when CO 2 and H 2 O simultaneously reacts with carbon, there is a passive combination of steam and carbon dioxide in the gasification reaction. This means that the two gases operate on separated active sites without influencing each other. LiFeO 2 was also coated on the monoliths (15 / 20 μm mean pore size and 45 % porosity) and the coated filters' performance was evaluated during the soot particles loading. The pressure drop across the filters was very low (< 8 mbar) during loading showing that the applied coated method on the filters was successfully. On the other hand, the catalytic filter coupled with the rotated cube cell was tested at the pilot plant to examine their interaction, the effect of the coating method and the penalty in pressure drop of all system. A pressure drop of 0 - 68 mbar obtained during the test proves that the coating method did not alter the operation of the plant. As for testing at the demonstration plant, firstly, a monolith (Rh/Pt) was tested close coupled with an uncoated filter using an O/C ratio from 0. 9 to 1. 3, S/C ratio equal to 2. 0, an inlet temperature (Tin) of 450 °C with a GHSV from 5000 to 14000 h- 1. The overall result fully agrees with the prediction from the simulation. The thermodynamic equilibrium was reached during the testing time with a methane conversion of 98 % and hydrogen yield of 2. 0. Moreover, tests with the integration of the catalyzed conventional foam and the catalytic trap downstream of the reforming reactor were performed. The boundary conditions were a space velocity of 4000, S/C= 2 and O/C= 1. 1. A thermodynamic equilibrium and a methane conversion higher than 98 % were achieved. The plant was able to reach the predicted conversions and concentrations at nominal capacities corresponding to 50 Nm 3 /h (100 Kg/day) of pure hydrogen, creating a negligible pressure drop during the operation time of the processor. Finally, this thesis also deals with a comparative LCA of three different hydrogen production process from biogas. The investigated processes are: the biogas ATR, the biogas steam reforming (SR) and the water hydrolysis (a biogas-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) followed by an electrolyzer). They were compared using environmental (GWP) and energetic (GER) impacts in order to highlight their weaknesses and strengths. H 2 from biogas ATR has been demonstrated to be the most promising process in terms of the emissions reduction and energetic efficiency considering its life cycle from the extraction and processing of raw materials to the production of high purity hydrogen. The ICE + Electrolyzer process require a large amount of energy and biogas to sustain the electrochemical reactions. This feature makes such system the least energetically efficient with the most negative environmental impact. With a process efficiency of 65 %, 63 % and 25 % for ATR, steam reforming and electrolysis process, respectively. Lastly, the economic analysis was performed to evaluate the H 2 final cost. On the one hand, {{it was found that the}} process is economically favorable for H 2 production higher than 100 Nm 3 /h. On the other hand, in 10 years of amortization using this technology, the final cost for H 2 production of 100 Nm 3 /h from biogas is 3 €/Kg H 2, lower than the European target (5 €/kg H 2). The longer the plant life is, the more affordable the initial investment is...|$|E
50|$|Fibrous {{ceramic filters}} {{are made from}} several {{different}} types of ceramic fibers that are mixed {{together to form a}} porous media. This media can be formed into almost any shape and can be customized to suit various applications. The porosity can be controlled in order to produce high flow, lower efficiency or high efficiency lower volume filtration. Fibrous filters have an advantage over wall flow design of producing lower back pressure.Ceramic <b>wall-flow</b> <b>filters</b> remove carbon particulates almost completely, including fine particulates less than 100 nanometers (nm) diameter with an efficiency of greater than 95% in mass and greater than 99% in number of particles over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since the continuous flow of soot into the filter would eventually block it, it is necessary to 'regenerate' the filtration properties of the filter by burning-off the collected particulate on a regular basis. Soot particulates burn-off forms water and CO2 in small quantity amounting to less than 0.05% of the CO2 emitted by the engine.|$|R

This paper reviews {{the most recent}} developments carried out at Politecnico di Torino concerning two different trap types: zirconia-toughened-alumina foams catalysed with Cs-V catalysts, operating according to a deep filtration mechanism, and cordierite or SiC <b>wall-flow</b> <b>filters</b> catalysed with perovskite catalysts (e. g.

A final critical assessment points out that most chances of practical application in mobile sources lie in wall-flow type traps for their superior filtration efficiency (greater than 95 %) and their compatibility with active trap regeneration means (e. g. fuel post-injection) that can occasionally rise on purpose the exhaust gas temperature to accelerate the catalytic combustion of trapped soot. Conversely, completely passive solutions based on deep filtration catalytic traps show only promise for stationary applications at temperatures higher than 350 °C, due to insufficient catalyst activity at lower temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A diesel {{particulate}} filter (DPF) is a key technology to meet future emis-sion standards of particulate matters (PM), mainly soot. It is generally consists of a <b>wall-flow</b> type <b>filter</b> positioned in the exhaust stream of a diesel vehicle. It is difficult to simulate the thermal flow in DPF, {{because we need to}} consider the soot deposi-tion and combustion in the complex geometry of filter wall. In our previous study, we proposed an approach for the conjugate simulation of gas-solid flow. That is, the gas phase was simulated by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), coupled with the equation of heat conduction inside the solid filter substrate. However, its numerical procedure was slightly complex. In this study, to reduce numerical costs, we have tested a new boundary condition with chemical equilibrium in soot combustion at the surface of filter substrate. Based on the soot oxidation rate with catalysts evaluated in experiments, the lattice Boltzmann simulation of soot combustion in the catalyzed DPF is firstly presented to consider the process in the after-treatment of diesel exhaust gas. The heat and mass transfer is shown to discuss the effect of catalysts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wall-flow</b> {{particulate}} <b>filters</b> are {{a required}} {{exhaust aftertreatment system}} to abate particulate matter emissions and meet current and incoming regulations applying worldwide to new generations of diesel and gasoline internal combustion engines. Despite the high filtration efficiency covering {{the whole range of}} emitted particle sizes, the porous substrate constitutes a flow restriction especially relevant as particulate matter, both soot and ash, is collected. The dependence of the resulting pressure drop, and hence the fuel consumption penalty, on the particulate matter distribution along the inlet channels is discussed in this paper taking as reference experimental data obtained in water injection tests before the particulate filter. This technique is demonstrated to reduce the particulate filter pressure drop without negative effects on filtration performance. In order to justify these experimental data, the characteristics of the particulate layer are diagnosed applying modeling techniques. Different soot mass distributions along the inlet channels are analyzed combined with porosity change to assess the new properties after water injection. Their influence on the subsequent soot loading process and regeneration is assessed. The results evidence the main mechanisms of the water injection at the filter inlet to reduce pressure drop and boost the interest for control strategies able to force the re-entrainment of most of the particulate matter towards the inlet channels’ end...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a new multi-dimensional Finite Volume (FV) solver {{of partial}} {{differential}} equations (PDEs) for compressible and reacting flows through porous media has been developed.

40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} {{maldistribution}} phenomena inside porous ceramic diesel particulate filters {{and their effects}} on the pressure drop and regeneration characteristics {{is important for the}} successful design and modelling of this class of exhaust aftertreatment system. In this paper the results from an experimental study of flow distribution in <b>wall-flow</b> diesel <b>filters</b> are presented. The experiments were performed on a specially designed cold flow test rig, under steady state flow conditions. The flow distribution at the exit of cordierite and SIC filters were measured with a hot film velocity sensor under low and medium mass flowrate conditions. The system configuration was varied to incorporate tests with and without the installation of an oxidation catalyst before the filter in order to investigate the effect of the catalyst honeycomb structure to the measured flow distribution. Flow distribution in filters loaded with various levels of particulate mass was also measured using the same device. The filters were loaded in a modern diesel engine run on catalyst-doped fuel up to different backpressure levels. A flow uniformity index was adopted in order to quantify the measured flow maldistribution by a single number for each case. The velocity distribution at the exit of the filters is found to be significantly affected by certain design and operating parameters of the system: diffuser-catalyst-filter. The results of this work aim to give a better assessment of the magnitude of flow maldistribution in diesel filters, which severely distort their pressure drop characteristics and affect the distribution of collected soot mass. In this way, a previously neglected aspect of the complex three-dimensional filter regeneration behaviour is better understood...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} rising costs {{of fossil fuels}} and, on the other hand, the {{availability}} of economic incentives {{and the development of}} advanced equipment solutions has made biomass combustion an attractive and efficient alternative for the production of heat and electricity at different scales of the plant. In fact, biomass is a renewable energy source widely used for energy production but, unfavourably, it is an important source of inhalable fine PM in ambient air as well. Among the different technologies for the abatement of these pollutants, wall flow catalytic filters may represent an efficient solution, since they combine physical filtration processes with catalytic oxidative reactions. The analysed filters, made of Silicon Carbide and loaded with 20 %wt of Copper Ferrite (CuFe 2 O 4), were properly shaped to be tested in the sampling line at the exhaust of a 30 kW pellet boiler located at ENEA research facilities. The paper presents the main experimental results related to the filter regeneration, the critical operative phase in order to provide adequate performance and service life of the filters. In the tests, regeneration, obtained by means of a high-temperature electrical heater wrapped around the filter housing, started when the pressure drop in the filter exceeded 600 Pa (the transition value from depth filtration to cake filtration) and the heater temperature was gradually increased from 180 °C to 500 °C. Tests showed high efficiency in PM reduction of <b>wall-flow</b> catalytic <b>filters,</b> moreover a relation between the beginning of the regeneration and the temperature of the flue gas at the filter outlet, in the range 220 - 280 °C, was found.

40|$|A computational, {{three-dimensional}} {{approach to}} investigate the behavior of diesel soot particles in the micro-channels of a <b>wall-flow,</b> porous-ceramic particulate <b>filter</b> is presented. Particle size examined is in the PM 2. 5 range. The flow field is simulated with a finite-volume Navier-Stokes solver and the Ergun equation is used to model the porous material. The permeability coefficients were obtained by fitting experimental data. Particle flow, dispersion, deposition and wall-particle interactions are investigated tracking large swarms of 2 and 0. 2 mu m diameter particles in a Lagrangian frame of reference. Particle dynamics included rarefied gas hypotheses (the Knudsen number being larger than unity) and bounce/capture models based on impact kinetic energy loss. The influence of gas molecules-particle interaction on overall particle behavior is also examined by including Brownian motion and partial slip in particle equation of motion. Simulations help to highlight three-dimensional non-uniform particle deposition, mainly due to flow distribution in the micro-channel. All particles deposit onto the porous filter wall following {{the distribution of the}} through-wall velocity. The larger, 2 mu m, particles show a larger tendency to deposit {{at the end of the}} filter. Due to the flow contraction at the inlet, virtually no particle deposit in the inlet section of the filter.

5000|$|<b>Wall-flow</b> diesel {{particulate}} <b>filters</b> usually remove 85% {{or more of}} the soot, {{and under}} certain conditions can attain soot removal efficiencies approaching 100%. Some filters are single-use, intended for disposal and replacement once full of accumulated ash. Others are designed to burn off the accumulated particulate either passively {{through the use of a}} catalyst or by active means such as a fuel burner which heats the filter to soot combustion temperatures. This is accomplished by engine programming to run (when the filter is full) in a manner that elevates exhaust temperature, in conjunction with an extra fuel injector in the exhaust stream that injects fuel to react with a catalyst element to burn off accumulated soot in the DPF filter, or through other methods. This is known as [...] "filter regeneration". Cleaning is also required as part of periodic maintenance, and it must be done carefully to avoid damaging the filter. Failure of fuel injectors or turbochargers resulting in contamination of the filter with raw diesel or engine oil can also necessitate cleaning. The regeneration process occurs at road speeds higher than can generally be attained on city streets; vehicles driven exclusively at low speeds in urban traffic can require periodic trips at higher speeds to clean out the DPF. If the driver ignores the warning light and waits too long to operate the vehicle above 40 mph, the DPF may not regenerate properly, and continued operation past that point may spoil the DPF completely so it must be replaced. Some newer diesel engines, namely those installed in combination vehicles, can also perform what is called a Parked Regeneration, where the engine increases RPM to around 1400 while parked, to increase the temperature of the exhaust.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the mass}} of {{particulate}} matter stored in a diesel particulate filter is imperative for making sound filter regeneration decisions. Currently, the mean-value pressure drop is used to estimate filter particulate load. However, this approach is fraught with accuracy and repeatability problems. In this research, dynamic pressure signal features are examined for this purpose. Specifically, the normalized firing frequency components are extracted from the dynamic pressures upstream, downstream, and across the filter using the complex Fourier Transform for periodic signals. Experimental data show that the firing frequency features appear to have smaller variability and better repeatability than the mean-value pressure drop. In back-to-back filter loading experiments, the mean-value pressure drop varied by around 25 % while variations in the firing frequency features varied by less than about 7 %. The firing frequency features can be used alone or in conjunction with the mean-value pressure drop to improve particulate load estimation. For a loading difference of 0. 25 g/L in the diesel particulate filter, discrimination errors are as high as 3. 4 % using only the mean-value pressure drop, while 0 % error is achieved using the firing frequency features. The discernible particulate load changes can be reduced to less than 0. 25 g/L when the mean-value and firing frequency features are combined. A 1 -D compressible unsteady-flow model was constructed for the flow in the channels of <b>wall-flow</b> diesel particulate <b>filters</b> to study the impact of parameter variations on the firing frequency features. Using this model, the permeability of the porous wall and particulate cake layer demonstrate a nonlinear relationship with the mean-value pressure drop and the firing frequency features. On the other hand, particulate cake layer density has an approximately linear relationship. The simulated firing frequency features were not normalized and showed similar percentage changes with parameter variations. This suggests that the normalization applied to the experimental data is important in suppressing the variations in the firing frequency features. Another important contribution of this research is the construction and validation of a particulate matter measuring system capable of approximately ± 1 g accuracy during steady-state engine operation. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wall-flow</b> diesel {{particulate}} <b>filter</b> (DPF) {{is currently}} the usual post-treatment system in diesel engines for soot particle abatement in passenger, heavy-duty and non-road vehicles. It consists in alternately plugged parallel square channels, in order to force the exhaust gases to flow through the porous inner walls: soot is so collected {{on the surface and}} in the porosity of the channel walls, progressively blocking the pores, making mandatory the filter regeneration. In this work we realised a specific pre-treatment procedure in order to modify the porosimetric characteristics of the bare support, with the aim of increasing the active species load and simultaneously keeping the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency of the final catalytic system in the same range of an uncatalysed DPF. The pre-treatment is based on a controlled chemical erosion of the SiC porous structure with a HF:HNO 3 acid solution. The results showed that, if compared with the analogues prepared without acid treatment, the pre-treated samples resulted with a modified pores distribution, with an increased average pore diameter. This important result allowed us to obtain new catalytic filters with higher catalyst load, higher regeneration activity and simultaneously keeping the pressure drop at similar values of the uncatalysed filters. As a consequence of these improved performances, a decrease in the frequency and duration of the regeneration step will be possible without affecting the filtration efficiency, as verified from the deposition and on-line microwave assisted regeneration tests. In particular, the results showed that the simultaneous porosity modification and the higher catalyst loading (30 %wt of copper ferrite) allowed to decrease the threshold catalyst temperature to about 350  °C, but more importantly allowed to decrease the regeneration step duration from about 22 to about 15  min. Moreover, the addition of K to the catalyst formulation had the important effect of further decreasing the regeneration time to about 8  min, even if it had no effect on the threshold temperature. So, very positive effects on the performances of the final catalysed filter prepared on the carrier with a modified porosity with the proposed procedure are observed on the energy needed to regenerate the filter: the comparison of the microwave energy supplied, considering the same filter volume (about 0. 35  liters), during the microwave assisted regeneration phase of all the filter typologies considered in this work, compared to the traditional fuel post-injection, showed that just the addition of the catalyst allows an energy saving of about 60 %, that increased up to 75 % after the K addition to copper ferrite to a filter with modified porosity...|$|R

Conventional diesel vehicles gave particle number emissions of around 5 x 10 ^ 13 particles/km. Direct-injection gasoline vehicles mean particle number emissions were in the range 3 x 10 ^ 12 to 1 x 10 ^ 13 particles/km. The conventional, multi-point injection gasoline vehicle tested gave particle number emissions similar to the DPF equipped diesels. Particulate mass measurements of DPF equipped diesel vehicles were consistently below 1 mg/km, with a mean typically around 0. 57 mg/km and repeatability of 26 % or less (expressed as coefficient of variance). Conventional diesel vehicles gave mean particulate mass results in the range 11 - 40 mg/km. Direct-injection gasoline vehicles varied from 2 - 13. 5 mg/km mean particulate emissions, whilst the conventional multi-point injection gasoline vehicle gave mean emissions similar to the DPF equipped diesels. Reproducibility of the measurement was assessed by testing a single DPF equipped ‘Golden Vehicle’ in all laboratories.
