5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully is hopeful about reuniting with her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) when a complete stranger offers new information about <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> him into hiding. Yet her trust in the stranger may place Mulder in even more danger, for the man {{turns out to be}} a super soldier.|$|E

When he was asked <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> him to keep pushing back the boundaries of athletic accomplishment, he noted sprinter Usain Bolt's record breaking streak as a motivating example of what is possible for all dedicated athletes.|$|E
25|$|In his stories, Roger Zelazny {{frequently}} portrayed {{characters from}} myth, {{depicted in the}} modern world. Zelazny included many anachronisms, such as cigarette-smoking (see below) and references to modern drama, in his work. His crisp, minimalistic dialogue {{also seems to be}} somewhat influenced by the style of wisecracking hardboiled crime authors, such as Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. The tension between the ancient and the modern, surreal and familiar was <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> most of his work.|$|E

500|$|Morris has exerted a {{powerful}} influence on thinking about {{art and design}} over the past century. He has been the constant niggle in the conscience. How can we combat all this luxury and waste? <b>What</b> <b>drove</b> him into revolutionary activism was his anger and shame at the injustices within society.

500|$|The {{character}} was paired with fellow resident Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) who shared a deceptive personality with him. This created many stories for both characters as they plotted against their neighbours. Dennis stated [...] "the Paul and Izzy relationship was fantastic, {{it was very}} popular. Izzy was an interesting character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> her evil ways. She {{had a bit of}} a soulmate in Paul."

500|$|Genevieve Lhermitte's {{lawyers were}} Daniel Spreutels and Xavier Magnee. The jury {{consisted}} of eight women and four men. Genevieve Lhermitte {{confessed to the}} murder of her children, so the trial focused on <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> Lhermitte commit the crime. Xavier Magnee told the jury, [...] "Your task is to discover why a woman who had hitherto been a perfect mother suddenly exploded." [...] This statement was made early on in the trial and started the thought process of what made Lhermitte so unstable that she would kill her own children. Prosecutor Pierre Rans began opening statements with a description of the scene that met emergency services on February 28, 2007 at the former teacher's home in Nivelles. The prosecutor asked for 30 years in prison.|$|E
500|$|Halloween is a 2007 American slasher film written, directed, and {{produced}} by Rob Zombie. The {{film is a}} remake/reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name; {{the first in the}} rebooted Halloween film series and the ninth installment of the Halloween franchise. The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers, [...] Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode; Daeg Faerch portrays a ten-year-old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's [...] "reimagining" [...] follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very good here [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a sense of where her need comes from, if there was some hint at <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writer Mel Tolkin {{stated that}} Caesar [...] "didn't like {{one-line}} jokes in sketches {{because he felt}} that if the joke was a good one, anybody could do it. One-liners would take him away from <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> his personal approach to comedy." [...] Larry Gelbart called Caesar's style theatrical, and called him [...] "...a pure TV comedian." [...] In describing his control during the live performances, actress Nanette Fabray recalled that unlike most comedians, such as Red Skelton, Bob Hope or Milton Berle, Caesar always stayed in character: [...] "He was so totally into the scene he never lost it." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{much debate}} among historians about <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> the Viking expansion. One widely held {{idea is that}} it was a quest for {{retaliation}} against continental Europeans for their previous invasions of Viking homelands, such as Charlemagne's campaign to force Scandinavian pagans to convert to Christianity by killing any who refused to become baptized. The historian Rudolf Simek has observed, [...] "It is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne." [...] Those who favor this explanation point out that the penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia caused serious conflict and divided Norway for almost a century. However, the first target of Viking raids was not the Frankish Kingdom, but Christian monasteries in England, which seems inconsistent with vengeance as a motive but would be consistent with religious warfare.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{follows the}} life of San Francisco-based Christopher Chance (Mark Valley), a unique private contractor, {{bodyguard}} and security expert hired to protect his clients. Rather than taking on the target's identity himself (as in the comic book version), he protects his clients by completely integrating himself into their lives, to become a [...] "human target". Chance is accompanied by business partner Winston (Chi McBride) and hired gun Guerrero (Jackie Earle Haley). Former client Ilsa Pucci (Indira Varma) becomes Chance's benefactor, while experienced thief Ames (Janet Montgomery) joins the team to seek redemption. Chance puts himself {{on the line to}} find the truth behind the mission. Even his own business partner Winston does not know <b>what</b> <b>drove</b> him towards this life, although it is explained in the first-season finale episode (which also explains about the name Christopher Chance itself).|$|E

2500|$|Recycling {{plants such}} as those at Kaybob, West Whitecourt and Crossfield {{produced}} liquids-rich gas from [...] "retrograde condensation" [...] reservoirs. They stripped condensate and natural gas liquids and sulfer (which they alternately stored in blocks or sold, depending on demand and price), then re-injected the dry gas to cycle the reservoir to capture more liquids. Usually these plants needed [...] make-up gas to replace {{the volume of the}} liquids stripped which came from other reservoirs. In the case of West Whitecourt, they also processed dry but sour gas from the Pine Creek field (near Edson) as a source of make-up gas. In the case of Crossfield, the liquids-rich gas came from the Wabamun D-1 zone and the make-up gas from the uphole Elkton zone. Most of these plants were built in the days of 16 cent long-term [...] contracts from TransCanada PipeLine when the National Energy Board required 25 years of reserves in the ground in order to gain an export permit (from Canada). <b>What</b> <b>drove</b> the economics of this procedure was not gas production, but the liquids that could be recovered and sold as part of the crude mix.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 February 1831, after a fifty-day conclave, Cappellari was {{unexpectedly}} {{chosen to}} succeed Pope Pius VIII (1829-30). His election {{was influenced by}} the fact that the cardinal considered the most papabile, Giacomo Giustiniani, was vetoed by King Ferdinand VII of Spain. [...] There then arose a deadlock between the other two major candidates, Emmanuele De Gregorio and Bartolomeo Pacca. <b>What</b> finally <b>drove</b> them to make a decision was a message from the Duke of Parma notifying them that revolt was about to break out in the northern Papal States. To resolve the impasse, the cardinals turned to Cappellari, but it took as many as eighty-three ballots for the canonically required two-thirds majority to be reached.|$|R

40|$|Mortgage {{interest}} rates dipped to record lows early last summer, providing homeowners with a refinancing bonanza.

40|$|<b>What</b> factors <b>drove</b> {{globalization}} in {{the late}} 19 th century? We employ a new micro-founded measure of bilateral trade costs based on a standard model of trade in differentiated goods to address this question. These trade costs gauge the difference between observed bilateral trade and frictionless trade. They comprise tariffs, transportation costs, and all other factors that impede international trade but which are inherently difficult to observe. Trade costs fell on average by 10 - 16 percent between 1870 and 1913. We also use this measure to decompose the growth of trade over that period and find that roughly 44 percent of the rise in trade within our sample {{can be explained by}} reductions in trade costs: the remaining 56 percent is attributable to economic expansion.
