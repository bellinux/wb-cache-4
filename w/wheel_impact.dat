40|$|Abstract: The {{risk for}} rail breaks is {{investigated}} from mechanical and statistical {{points of view}} with particular focus {{on the influence of}} impact loads from flatted wheels. For a presumed rail head crack geometry and rail temperature, the stochastic relation between the crack position along the rail and the <b>wheel</b> flat <b>impact</b> position results in a risk of fracture. In addition to the analysisof the risk forfinal fracture, rail crackgrowth is also studied. Inparticular, thecontribution of <b>wheel</b> flat <b>impacts</b> on crack growth rates is quantified. The study {{takes the form of a}} dynamic load analysis that evaluates rail bending moments due to <b>wheel</b> flat <b>impact.</b> Then, a fracture mechanics analysis is employed to establish stress intensity factors for rail head cracks under bending and temperature loading. These analyses are then combined to give risks of rail breaks and to quantify crack growth rates for varying operational conditions...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{research}} on the development of a longer life insulated rail joint (IRJ), this paper reports a field experiment and a simplified 2 D numerical modelling for the purpose of investigating the behaviour of rail web in the vicinity of endpost in an insulated rail joint (IRJ) due to wheel passages. A simplified 2 D plane stress finite element model is used to simulate the wheel-rail rolling contact impact at IRJ. This model is validated using data from a strain gauged IRJ that was installed in a heavy haul network; data in terms of the vertical and shear strains at specific positions of the IRJ during train passing were captured and compared with the results of the FE model. The comparison indicates a satisfactory agreement between the FE model and the field testing. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the experimental and numerical analyses reported in this paper provide a valuable datum for developing further insight into the behaviour of IRJ under <b>wheel</b> <b>impacts...</b>|$|R
5000|$|After Senna's car stopped he was {{initially}} motionless in the cockpit. After about ten seconds, as {{recorded by the}} close-up aerial footage, his head was seen to lift to the left before returning to its original position. Thereafter he did not move again. What appeared to have happened was that the right front wheel shot up upon impact and entered the cockpit, striking the right frontal area of his helmet. The violence of the <b>wheel's</b> <b>impact</b> pushed his head back against the headrest, causing fatal skull fractures. A piece of suspension attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his Bell M3 helmet and caused trauma to his head. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna was using a medium-sized (58 cm) M3 helmet with a new [...] "thin" [...] Bell visor. Any {{one of the three}} injuries would probably have killed him.|$|R

50|$|This p-wave to s-wave {{delay was}} put to test {{to see if it}} could be used to sense the real time {{position}} of a faulty <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> on a train on a track while moving at full speed. Test calculations has shown that the relative short distances of less than a few meters complicated the ability to clearly differentiated between the start of the p-wave and the subsequent arrival of the s-wave. Typical <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> pulse frequencies are below 2 kHz.The wave propagation delay time between the p-wave and s-wave over a distance of 1 meter is smaller than half the wavelength of the typical average frequency of the <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> impulse. This condition makes the method of measuring p-wave vs s-wave propagation delays virtually impossible since the s-wave will be superimposed on the p-wave before the ADC had the chance to even capture one full wavelength. Since seismic sensor calibration to KIPS are very critical it is important to capture at least a number of full wave cycles in order to establish whether the wheel exceeds allowed compression levels.|$|E

There is also force absorbed by this action that will affect the energy consumption of train operations.|$|R
50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a threaded fastener retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the <b>wheel</b> <b>impacts</b> a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|R

This type of sensing however {{would not be able to}} distinguished between the source of the vibrations originating from either the rail track or wheel/bogie. There are many environmental factors that would make mote sensing highly subjective.|$|E
50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> phase detector. A <b>wheel</b> <b>impact</b> load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E

40|$|Impact forces develop at the wheel/rail {{interface}} due to {{the presence}} of defects in the running surface of the wheel and/ or the railhead. This paper reports on <b>wheel</b> <b>impacts,</b> caused by permanently dipped rail joints, that are characterised by high-frequency impact forces generated by high amplifications of the static load that occur for a very short duration (P 1 forces), followed by relatively low frequency, lower amplitude forces (P 2 forces) that occur for a longer duration. These impact forces are affected by the design of components adjacent to the wheel and rail, namely the bogie’s primary suspension and rail seat pads; the influences of stiffness and damping characteristics of these components are investigated. A modified three-dimensional simulation model of the dynamics of the wagon/track system that includes defects in the track is created and is used to obtain the time series of the impact force. This is converted into impact force factors that are compared with a set of field-measured data reported in the literature. A simplified equation for the determination of impact force factors due to dipped rail joints is also proposed and validated...|$|R

50|$|The {{search for}} {{effective}} methods to detect in motion broken railcar wheels has delivered promising new technological advances {{with the arrival}} of WIPD or <b>Wheel</b> <b>Impact</b> phase detection. The phase sensing method uses two or more seismic sensors connected to the side of a rail track to capture seismic noise generated by railcar wheels. A wheel that exceeds a preset seismic noise threshold in amplitude, will trigger a wheel tracking algorithm that calculates seismic phase shift data related to the actively tracked wheel noise level, to determine the precise location, in real time, of the faulty wheel carriage while moving at full speed. With the sensors spaced from each other such that seismic phase time propagation delays between sensors, in relation to the signal source, can be measured to calculate the exact position of the faulty wheel in real time.|$|E

Armstrong also drove the car that knocked director Landis through a shop window and performed a head-on collision with another stunt driver's car, both men driving at 15 mph to minimize the 30-mph impact, which injured Armstrong's wrists for three weeks after forgetting to take his hands off the steering <b>wheel</b> before <b>impact.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 'Double Three-legged Gravity Escapement' {{shown here}} {{is a form of}} {{escapement}} first devised by a barrister named Bloxam and later improved by Lord Grimthorpe. It is the standard for all really accurate 'Tower' clocks. [...] In the animation shown here the two [...] "gravity arms" [...] are coloured blue and red. The two three-legged escape wheels are also coloured blue and red. They work in two parallel planes so that the blue <b>wheel</b> only <b>impacts</b> the locking block on the blue arm and the red <b>wheel</b> only <b>impacts</b> the red arm. In a real escapement these impacts give rise to loud audible [...] "ticks" [...] and these are indicated by the appearance of a * beside the locking blocks. The three black lifting pins are key to the operation of the escapement. They cause the weighted gravity arms to be raised by an amount indicated by the pair of parallel lines {{on each side of the}} escapement. This gain in potential energy is the energy given to the pendulum on each cycle. For the Trinity College Cambridge Clock a mass of around 50 grams is lifted through 3 mm each 1.5 seconds - which works out to 1 mW of power. The driving power from the falling weight is about 12 mW, so t{{here is a}} substantial excess of power used to drive the escapement. Much of this energy is dissipated in the acceleration and deceleration of the frictional [...] "fly" [...] attached to the escape wheels.|$|R
