Using establishment data from the German employment statistics, the paper demonstrates that the divergence between wage agreements and effective wages is probably not a consequence of a massive escape from collective wage agreements, or the intense use of opt-out clauses in such agreements in East Germany. Rather, the shift of East Germany's economic structure towards lower-paying types of companies has caused the lagging behind in the adjustment of wages...|$|R

40|$|The way {{the labour}} market {{functions}} {{is a crucial}} factor in any analysis of the Swedish model. Full employment contributed {{to the growth of}} what were probably the two most important institutions in this model: centralised negotiations between the social partners and, secondly, the Rehn-Meidner model, involving pay policies based on solidarity with the low-paid. Here, we have examined the role of the employers in the rise, application and fall of the centralised bargaining model. In this respect, the Swedish Metal Trades Employers' Association (VF), the largest and most important employer organisation in the peak association SAF, was the actor whose interests eventually led to the model's demise. The principal cause was discontent over the way this bargaining model worked in practice. The engineering industries felt their interests were being neglected in the giant employer collective. This empirical investigation into an employer organisations's internal actions, combining economic history with organisation theory, shows the importance of the market mechanism for employer policy during full employment.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{used in the}} dissertation is a {{paired comparison}} of Ireland (?Social Partnership? 1987 - 2005) and Australia (?The Accord? 1983 - 1996), with reference to other cases of central wage bargaining in liberal economies. The primary research question is, what explains the stability of Irish central wage bargaining {{in comparison to the}} decentralization of wage bargaining experienced in Australia in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s? There are two conditions that must be sustained in order that central wage bargaining is stable in open liberal economies. First, public sector wages must be kept under strict control and large <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> must be avoided. Second, export sector employers must be able to exercise pay flexibility. Pay flexibility is defined as encompassing an outcome dimension (exporters should be allowed to give pay increases above or below the centrally agreed wage bargain increase) and a process dimension (exporters should be allowed to set wages with a minimum of interference from third parties, be they wage setting institutions or trade unions). The two necessary conditions of public sector wage control and export sector pay flexibility are found in the Irish case explaining central wage bargaining stability, but not in the Australian case, explaining its wage bargaining decentralization. In Ireland after 1987, the stability of the system has been enabled by a concerted effort by policy-makers to de-couple pay movements between the public and export sectors. This is achieved through allowing export employers pay flexibility, while ending old patterns of public sector relativities-driven wage bargaining. This is in contrast to the late 1970 s and early 1980 s where large public sector <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> caused the decentralization of wage bargaining. The Australian system decentralized because wage arbitration institutions created during a closed trade policy regime interfered with the process aspect of pay flexibility of exporters. These institutions intruded into wage setting at the plant level, and enhanced the power of trade unions to influence and alter the wage setting process. This provoked a successful export-employer led offensive on the central wage bargaining system...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{centralization}} may {{not necessarily}} mean coordination or vice versa (OECD 1997). First, {{if there is a}} significant discrepancy between the individual firm-level negotiated wage and the globally negotiated wage, which is called <b>wage</b> <b>drift,</b> the extent of coordination may be weaker despite the centralized wage setting. Second, institutions such as pattern-setting may promote coordination, while it is also substitutable for institutions that are intended to promote centralization. 6 There are several different claims regarding the effects of centralization and coordination on unemployment rates. Nickell (1997) refers to the notion of OECD (1994) Table 5.16 that coordinative arrangements lower wages, while centralized arrangements do not, and summarizes that the negative effects of unionization on employment are mitigated by coordination. In contrast, Calmfors and Driffill (1988) claim that the relation between centralization and employment is U-shaped, while Driffill (2006) later find that highly coordinated or centralized bargaining leads to wage restraint and a low unemployment rate.|$|E

Finally, they emphasize the way wage tax rules can affect employment and wage and how critical is their design. The authors conclude that because of the inherited ownership structure and the uncertainty associated with reform, market-based regimes will continue to need centralized controls over wages in worker-controlled firms (the socialized sector).

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} how {{labor market}} {{conditions}} at different points during the tenure of individuals with firms are correlated with current earnings. Using data on individuals from the German Socioeconomic Panel for the 1985 - 1994 period, we find that both the contemporaneous unemployment rate and prior values of the unemployment rate are significantly correlated with current earnings, contrary to results for the American labor market. Estimated elasticities vary between 9 and 15 percent for the elasticity of earnings with respect to current unemployment rates, and between 6 and 10 percent with respect to unemployment rates {{at the start of}} current firm tenure. Moreover, whereas local unemployment rates determine levels of earnings, national rates influence contemporaneous variations in earnings. We interpret this result as evidence that German unions do, in fact, bargain over wages and employment, but that models of individualistic contracts, such as the implicit contract model, may explain some of the observed <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> and longer-term wage movements reasonably well. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneity of contracts over a variety of worker and job characteristics. In particular, we find evidence that contracts differ across firm size and worker type.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of two types of counter-factual real wage cuts on the key demand components, output and employment in Finland {{over the past few}} years. A freeze of contract wages at the 2010 level would have improved significantly employment in Finland by 2016. A cautious assessment is that the loss of jobs would have been at most around half of the true one. If the freeze of the contract wages had been complemented by a negative <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> as in Germany, the employment impact would have been even greater. At least 2 / 3 of the job losses would have been avoided. The decline of real wages would have implied smaller consumption. The loss would not have been great, however. Private consumption per head would have remained greater than that in Sweden throughout the period. The results lend support to the attempts to conclude an agreement between the labour market partners on improving cost competitiveness, to modify wage formation to better take into account cost competitiveness requirements and a greater role for company and establishment level agreements. However, the results also suggest that the positive effects on growth and employment take time. On the other hand, the wage adjustment alternatives examined would not have taken output back to the pre-crisis level. This suggests that insufficient cost competitiveness has not been the only reason for the slow recovery of the Finnish economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{stability}} of centralized wage-setting systems {{in light of the}} on-going decentralization of labor relations in much of the Western world. It takes the decline of peak level bargaining in Sweden, the traditional archetype of centralized collective bargaining, as its key case for study, but is intended to speak to other cases as well. Like many earlier analysts, we argue that centralization offers potential economic gains by internalizing the costs of inefficient wage inflation. With this potential benefit, however, comes a cost: centralized decisions are not sufficiently responsive to local conditions. To avoid excessive inflexibility, the center can allow for "wage drift" at the local level (i. e., local wage settlements above the central agreement), but once the center allows <b>wage</b> <b>drift,</b> it becomes difficult to distinguish between justifiable drift due to local economic conditions and unjustifiable drift in the self-interest of local bargaining pairs. Thus, centralized wage-setting systems face a tradeoff: allowing less drift makes it easier to monitor local bargaining pairs but harder to achieve the appropriate responsiveness to local conditions. We develop a game-theoretic model of this tradeoff, and consider how the center's optimal policy moves towards decentralization (i. e., towards allowing more drift) as the cost of inflexibility rises. We then interpret the evolution of centralized bargaining in Sweden in light of the model. We argue that centralized bargaining flourished when the private-sector blue-collar workers (represented by LO) dominated the workforce, but began to wane as public-sector and white-collar unions grew in strength, as skill differentials in decentralized labor markets grew in size, and as product-market competition intensified (especially through the shortening of product lifecycles). ...|$|E
40|$|Wage rigidity, {{stemming}} from highly distortive labor market policies, {{is a natural}} candidate to explain the over-valuation of the CFA Franc after the adverse external shocks of the 1980 s. This paper uses a variety of data sources to assess the actual rigidity of wages in CFA countries and to analyze how it relates to their labor market policies. The paper shows that wages are high in CFA countries, both compared to wages in similar countries and to the labor earnings of similar individuals within the same countries. It also shows that wages are rigid in real terms, {{in the sense of}} following closely the fluctuations of government wages and consumer prices, but finds no evidence of nominal wage rigidity. Labor market policies may not be at the roots of wage misalignment and real rigidity though. From an international perspective, minimum wages are not high enough to account for the observed wage misalignment. Moreover, their adjustment over time is shown to be highly responsive to real shocks. Private sector unions, in turn, seem more instrumental in achieving wage moderation than <b>wage</b> <b>drift.</b> Their members usually get lower wages than similar, non-unionized workers, which probably reflects the “subordinate ” nature of the labor movement. The most likely candidates to explain wage misalignment and real rigidity in CFA countries are therefore government pay policies and (possibly) limited competition in product markets. ______________ (*) I am grateful to Ingrid Ivins, John McIntire, Peter Niessen and Abdoulaye Seck for help in gathering the data, to Raquel Artecona for assistance with the empirical analysis, and to Geoffrey Bergen, Larry Hinkle and participants in seminars in Abidjan and Lomé for comments.
