Since CFD is very common in early design evaluation, {{it is important to}} understand how modelling of different phenomena might affect the results. This paper presents a study on the sensitivity of wheel geometrical orientation when modelling rotating wheels using Multiple Reference Frames (MRF). Predicted flow field and aerodynamic forces are compared with experimental data as well as time averaged results from transient simulations using MRF and sliding mesh to simulate more realistic wheel rotation.

40|$|Current {{maintenance}} criteria of railway <b>wheel</b> <b>geometries</b> consider mainly flange thickness, flange height, flange gradient, {{and depth of}} tread wear. These geometrical quantities are relatively simple to evaluate, but do not fully describe neither the worn profile nor its influence on subsequent deterioration of wheel and rail. With increased use of automatic wheel profile measurements {{there is a potential}} to plan maintenance from measures that provide a more elaborate description of the wheel profile and its operational capabilities. To this end, the paper first outlines a procedure to parametrise worn wheel profiles. This procedure is linked to multibody simulations of a curve negotiating freight wagon to identify parameters of the worn wheel profile with the largest influence on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear. To limit the number of parameter combinations, nearly orthogonal and space filling Latin hypercube sampling is employed. Regression analysis is then utilised to derive simple relationships (meta-models) between geometry parameters and deterioration measures. The derived meta-models of RCF and wear deterioration are shown to produce good agreement to results from fully fledged multibody simulations. The end result is identified geometrical quantities that provide an improved categorisation of the deteriorated <b>wheel</b> tread <b>geometry</b> for improved maintenance decisions...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} aspects of <b>wheel</b> <b>geometry</b> {{which must be}} brought into {{adjustment}} in order to true a wheel. [...] "Lateral truing" [...] refers to elimination of local deviations of the rim {{to the left or}} right of center.

This plane is itself determined as an average of local deviations in the lateral truing. For most rim-brake bicycles, the dish will be symmetrical on the front wheel. However, on the rear wheel, because most bicycles accommodate a rear sprocket (or group of them), the dishing will often be asymmetrical: it will be dished at a deeper angle on the non-drive side than on the drive side.|$|E

This study aimed to develop a method to provide {{optimised}} spoking geometries for rear bicycle wheels.

The developed script can be easily adapted to calculate the optimised <b>geometry</b> for any <b>wheel</b> with tensioned spokes. The load responses of the optimised wheels were then compared with conventional 2 X and 3 X spoke patterns and three commercially available wheels using ANSYS® FEA software.

These results confirmed that wheel design can be improved.

The combination of lunar regolith and reduced gravity creates issues for vehicular traction. NASA is interested in testing transportation systems in lunar environments to establish {{the relationship between the}} weight of a vehicle and its traction abilities on the lunar surface. The greater the mass of a vehicle, the better traction it will have in reduced gravity. However, a heavier vehicle requires more fuel to deliver the payload from the Earth to lunar orbit to the lunar surface and results in a costlier mission.

Design/methodology/approach: The accelerometers were fixed directly to the rail to provide the system with the best defect signal quality. Analysis of the acoustic signals collected using microphones proved that {{too much of the}} background noise limited their usefulness.

A similar trend follows in aerodynamic development of vehicles where Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulations are increasing in complexity and accuracy. Even though these simulations have previously been used to evaluate trends of different design and analyse the flow field around the car, they are aimed at being used to predict exact figures in the future. Wheel flow aerodynamics {{has been the focus of}} CFD research for several years now especially with the expected introduction of the WLTP regulations, which will require car manufactures to evaluate the drag of the vehicle for all different rim and tyre combinations the car could have in order to determine its official fuel consumption.

This thesis investigates the effects of different <b>wheel</b> <b>geometries</b> as well as different wheel rotation modelling techniques and their effect on overall vehicle forces. 	An important parameter to consider when validating simulations is the cooling flow as the amount of air going through the vehicles engine bay changes the airflow around the car thus affecting the flow directed towards the wheels. In this thesis a novel, simple, and quick method for measuring cooling flow is introduced. This allows the monitoring of cooling flow during aerodynamic development at low costs especially with the introduction of grill shutters as a further step to reduce aerodynamic drag when cooling flow is not needed...|$|R
