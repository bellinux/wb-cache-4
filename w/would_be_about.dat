Later Forward found an earlier letter in which he discussed the idea of high-gravity life in the Sun with science fiction novelist Hal Clement.|$|E
5|$|All {{copernicium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 29seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4seconds, and the unconfirmed 286Cn has a half-life of about 8.45seconds. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 0.1seconds. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives of 97ms, {{and the other two}} isotopes have half-lives slightly under one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few decades, and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 10−12 times as abundant as lead.|$|E

5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} violence case between Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} American entertainer Chris Brown, media speculated as to whether any song featured on her fourth upcoming album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> him. In an interview with MTV News, Ne-Yo clarified {{that he would not}} write a song for Rihanna about Brown, because he considered the idea unnecessary. Harmony said that no matter what song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album, it would be looked at as a song about Brown.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some {{involving}} a tunnel to Staten Island.

Omine read several books about grifters for {{preparation}} for writing the episode. The other writers also prepared themselves by watching several heist films, including House of Games, Paper Moon and The Sting, the latter {{two of which are}} referenced in the episode. For example, the revelation that Devon Bradley, the FBI agent in the episode who is revealed to be a con artist, was inspired by such films.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|The name Diane was {{retired from}} the Atlantic {{hurricane}} naming list. Due to the damage from hurricanes in 1954 and 1955, including Diane, public outcry over storm damage {{led to the creation}} of the National Hurricane Center in 1956. Using a monetary deflator in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> $7.4billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States. Accounting for inflation, changes in personal wealth, and population changes, it is estimated Diane would have caused $18billion in damage in 2010, or the 15th highest for a United States hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{practicality}} of {{this approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 2.17 kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|As Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165km/h, (105mph) were reported, with {{extensive}} damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses exactly as they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> A$84,000 (63,000 USD 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E

50|$|It is {{hypothesised}} {{that the}} impact of the Tauredunum landslide destabilised sedimentary deposits {{at the mouth of the}} Rhône, causing their collapse and triggering a large tsunami. According to computer simulations, a wave up to 16 m high <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> created by the collapse and would have travelled the full length of the lake within 70 minutes of the event. It would have struck Lausanne within only 15 minutes, where it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 13 m high, though the damage there <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> limited as the city stands on a steeply sloping shoreline. Much greater damage <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> caused at Geneva, where the wave <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 8 m. A wave this high <b>would</b> certainly have <b>been</b> capable of causing the destruction described by the chroniclers. Other towns along the lakeside <b>would</b> also have <b>been</b> hit by the wave, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 8 m high at Evian-les-Bains, 6 m high at Thonon-les-Bains and 4 m high at Nyon. It would have travelled at about 70 km/h, giving those on the shoreline little time to flee.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
