25|$|As {{businessmen}} {{became increasingly}} reluctant {{to send their}} sons to schools whose curricula offered nothing useful - or to donate money for their support, some educational leaders began exploring <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> higher education more attractive. Some backed the establishment of specialized schools of science and technology, like Harvard's Lawrence Scientific School, Yale's Sheffield Scientific School, and the newly chartered Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about to offer its first classes in 1865.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s young artists {{began to break}} away stylistically from {{abstract}} expressionism; experimenting with new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> pictures; and new ways of handling paint and color. In the early 1960s several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although {{they turned out to}} be profoundly different in the long run. Some of the new styles and movements that appeared in the early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: Washington Color School, Hard-edge painting, Geometric abstraction, Minimalism, and Color Field.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, South African forces invaded and the {{following}} year an Anglican priest, Nelson Fogarty, established the first Anglican presence, initially to minister to the South African troops and civilians who had followed the military occupation.

25|$|Thirty {{years ago}} there was neither real {{predictability}} nor qualitative understanding of the dominant mechanisms in emulsion polymerisation. Mechanisms had been ‘proved’ by comparing model predictions with experimental data. The data field was limited and the models had many adjustable parameters, or else fitting parameters had values that were subject to wide uncertainty: {{it was possible to}} choose values that could suit any model. It was not uncommon to find two papers claiming that quite different mechanisms were dominant in the same system, a result {{of not being able to}} isolate the individual steps. As a result of Gilbert’s work, all individual processes in emulsion polymerisation, one of the commonest <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> everyday products, are now qualitatively and quantitatively understood. It is now possible to polymerise simple systems and to predict the molecular architecture that will be formed under chosen conditions, while for more complex conditions, trends can be semiquantitatively predicted and understood. The international scientific and technical community in this field now uses the mechanistic knowledge that he obtained as the key to understanding current processes and creating new processes and products. His work has put this industrially important field on a rigorous scientific footing.|$|E
25|$|Intrigued by {{linguistic}} {{similarities between}} the Lithuanian and Sanskrit languages, Poška decided to travel to India to study Sanskrit, research Indian culture, and explore Lithuania's cultural links with India. He chose to travel on a motorbike, which they obtained from Belgian manufacturer FN for free in exchange for publicity. While preparing for the journey, he got acquainted with another dedicated traveler Matas Šalčius, a journalist by profession, who was much older and already an experienced traveler. The duo started their motorbike trip on 20 November 1929 from Kaunas. The travelers first reached Constantinople then Cairo and continued via the Middle East. They took very little money, 69 U.S. dollars combined, and had to find <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> money along the way. They financed the trip by giving lectures on Esperanto, Lithuania, and other topics as well as submitting articles and photos to Lithuanian and foreign press. However, the relationship between Šalčius and Poška deteriorated as they faced financial troubles and mechanical problems. While in Tehran, Poška became severely ill. Šalčius abandoned Poška and later did not mention him in his memoirs. Poška received help from local Esperantists and spent about half a year recovering. He then boarded a ship in Bushire and arrived in Bombay on 23 March 1931.|$|E
25|$|An Ayrshire story {{tells of}} how an Ayrshire baron once strung up an {{innocent}} man, just because his visitor {{had never seen}} a man hanged before. Hopefully this was an isolated example, however the system suffered from many faults due to bias, lack of legal training, etc., etc. As stated, a right of appeal to Regalities and sheriffdoms courts did exist. Details of the sometimes shocking excesses of baron bailies can make painful reading. As their power was great and generally abused, so many of them enriched themselves. They had many <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> money for themselves, such as (1) the bailie's darak, as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; (2) confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; (3) all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting green wood were laid on by themselves, and went into their own pockets. These fines amounted to what they pleased almost. (4) Another very lucrative perquisite they had was what was called the Herial Horse, which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed {{at the time of his}} death. This was taken from the widow and children for the bailie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.|$|E

25|$|Biogeography is {{the study}} of the {{geographical}} distribution of species. Evidence from biogeography, especially from the biogeography of oceanic islands, {{played a key role in}} convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a branching pattern of common descent. Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore, islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different ecological niches, that is have different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> a living in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of adaptive radiation where a single ancestral species colonises an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well-studied examples include Darwin's finches, a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galápagos Islands, and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a group of birds that once, before extinctions caused by humans, numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the Hawaiian Islands some 4 million years ago. Another example is the Silversword alliance, a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridised with one another and with certain tarweed species found on the west coast of North America; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonised Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{stresses}} Delius's {{role as an}} innovator: [...] "The best of Delius {{is undoubtedly}} {{to be found in}} those works where he disregarded classical traditions and created his own forms". Fenby echoes this: [...] "the people who really count are those who discover new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> our lives more beautiful. Frederick Delius was such a man". [...] Palmer writes that Delius's true legacy is the ability of his music to inspire the creative urge in its listeners and to enhance their awareness of the wonders of life. Palmer concludes by invoking George Eliot's poem The Choir Invisible: [...] "Frederick Delius... belongs to the company of those true artists for whose life and work the world is a better place to live in, and of whom surely is composed, in a literal sense, 'the choir invisible/Whose music is the gladness of the world'".|$|E
500|$|Messiaen taught an {{analysis}} {{class at the}} Paris Conservatoire. In 1947 he taught (and performed with Loriod) for two weeks in Budapest. In 1949 he taught at Tanglewood. Beginning in summer 1949 he taught in the new music summer school classes at Darmstadt. While he did not employ the twelve-tone technique, after three years teaching analysis of twelve-tone scores, including works by Arnold Schoenberg, he experimented with <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> scales of other elements (including duration, articulation and dynamics) analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. The results of these innovations was the [...] "Mode de valeurs et d'intensités" [...] for piano (from the Quatre études de rythme) which has been misleadingly described as the first work of [...] "total serialism". It had a large influence on the earliest European serial composers, including Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. During this period he also experimented with musique concrète, music for recorded sounds.|$|E

500|$|The book is {{composed}} of four essays: [...] "Characteristics of Total Institutions" [...] (1957); [...] "The Moral Career of the Mental Patient" [...] (1959); [...] "The Underlife of a Public Institution: A Study of <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Making</b> Out in a Mental Hospital"; and [...] "The Medical Model and Mental Hospitalization: Some Notes on the Vicissitudes of the Tinkering Trades". The first three essays focus on the experiences of patients; the last, on professional-client interactions. Goffman is mainly concerned with the details of psychiatric hospitalization and with the nature and effects of the process he calls [...] "institutionalization". He describes how institutionalization socializes people {{into the role of}} a good patient, someone [...] "dull, harmless and inconspicuous" [...] – a condition which in turn reinforces notions of chronicity in severe mental illness. Total institutions greatly affect people's interactions; yet, even in such places, people find ways to redefine their roles and reclaim their identities.|$|E

When Khan discovers the British regiment knows of his plan, he orders his beautiful slave to seduce and then kidnap Lieutenant Stone, {{in an attempt to}} extract sensitive information about the ammunition caravan from him. When the colonel refuses to attempt his rescue, McGregor and Forsythe, appalled by the [...] "lack of concern" [...] the colonel has for his own son, leave the camp at night without orders. Disguised as common natives trying to sell blankets, they are recognized by the beautiful slave, who has met the two men before at a civil event, and are captured. During a seemingly friendly interrogation, Khan says [...] "we have <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> men talk" [...] and proceeds to have the prisoners tortured; their nails are ripped off and the sensitive skin underneath is burned. While McGregor and Forsythe, despite the agonizing pain, refuse to speak, Stone cracks and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition is captured.|$|E
