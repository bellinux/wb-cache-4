25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that sexual violence is also a learnt behavior in some adults, particularly as regards child sexual abuse. Studies on sexually abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves.

Decades before Ukuthwalwa would entail legal bridal abduction, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> could choose a woman of his liking to be his bride and go into negotiations with the family of the bride without her knowledge or consent.

25|$|Antichrist is a 2009 English-language Danish {{experimental}} horror film {{written and}} directed by Lars von Trier, and starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who, after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behaviour and sadomasochism. The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production and co-produced by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men {{will allow them to}} interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> may be in a totally different position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E
25|$|A No. 40 Squadron Sunderland was {{involved}} in the first attempted hijacking of an RAAF aircraft on 14 September 1944. The aircraft had been tasked with flying prisoners, including US Military prisoners, from Cooktown to Port Moresby. One of the American prisoners being transported to the aircraft on board a launch seized a gun from one of his guards then disarmed the other guards. When the boat reached the Sunderland he tried to persuade the prisoners embarked on the plane to assist him, but they were unwilling. The boat then preceded to a jetty in Cooktown Harbour <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was persuaded to surrender. No. 40 Squadron suffered its only loss on 28 November when a Sunderland struck a post and sank after landing at Townsville; there were no fatalities.|$|E

500|$|Changes {{in society}} also brought {{challenges}} to the program. For example, in the 1990s Christian groups started to question the need to classify shamanistic rituals as cultural heritage. Patriarchal lifestyle, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is the main provider {{of the family and}} women stay at home, also influenced [...] "holders", as housewives started to pick up the preservation of folk traditions also in areas that were previously dominated by men. The government resisted appointing female holders for such predominantly male traditions but was gradually forced to acknowledge them when there were no male practitioners at all, or where the women were significantly more talented than the men.|$|E
500|$|It is {{immediately}} noticeable that {{the poem is}} written in a vernacular English. Though the Barrack-Room Ballads have made this appear a common feature of Kipling's work, {{at the time it}} was quite unusual; this was the first of his published works to be written in the voice of the common soldier. The speech is not a direct representation of any single dialect, but it serves to give a very clear effect of a working class English voice of the period. Note the [...] "taken of his buttons off", a deliberate error, to add to the stylised speech; it refers to the ceremony of military degradation, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to be executed is formally stripped of any marks of rank, such as his stripes, or of significant parts of his uniform – the buttons bore the regimental crest.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Man" [...] was {{directed}} by Urban Strom and produced by Danny Germaine in July 2009. It was shot in a mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California. For the video, the singer wore a [...] "clingy" [...] white vest and hotpants. It begins with showing {{a man who is}} in bed and cannot sleep. Ewen is later shown in the mansion which prompts the man to turn on the light of a torch, leave the bed and search for her. Ewen then begins dancing on the wall as the torch is being flashed at her by the man. During the second verse, she is shown singing on a couch, again with the torch being flashed. When the song's bridge begins, Ewen is shown dancing outside on the porch <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is watching her. As the video ends, it is revealed that the man was dreaming, in which Ewen appears near the room's curtains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first series}} was filmed on an {{uninhabited}} Pacific island, Isla Gibraleón, {{which is one}} of the Pearl Islands off the coast of Panama.

500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much rather have a Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film there is none (although there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E
500|$|Fairy Cube {{takes place}} in a fictional {{universe}} in which an Otherworld, inhabited by a variety of fairies and other nonhuman entities, exists alongside present-day Earth. The series focuses on , a timid fifteen-year-old who sees fairies—invisible to normal people—and is stalked by , a spiteful spirit only he can see. In his backstory, it is revealed that {{before the start of the}} series, his mother, [...] left, causing his novelist father, , to burn wing marks on Ian's back to prevent him from doing the same. , Ian's abused childhood friend and secret [...] "crush", later returns to the city where he lives after being separated for years. Stumbling upon the scene of a murder and seeing a man retrieve a cube from the victim's body, Ian follows him back to an antique shop, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> actually a Gancanagh named , gives him Tokage's fairy cube—a cube belonging to a fairy that can allow the fairy to take over the human who has it. Soon after, Ian is killed by his own father, who was manipulated by Tokage, and now exists as a spirit, with Tokage possessing his body. Returning to Kaito's shop and after a trip through the Otherworld with , a small yet powerful and vicious fairy in love with Kaito, Ian takes control of the body of a deceased young boy, [...] Moved by his determination, Ainsel agrees to aid him in his quest to regain his body.|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{element in}} Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, [...] "you {{look at the}} image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical." [...] In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added [...] "a hint of the steam [...] and the screaming kids", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies [...] "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise [...] "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order". Mulholland Drives ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering {{is an example of}} Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, [...] "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." ...|$|E

The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was characterized by a wide range of marriage practices—both polygynous and polyandrous alike, as well as monogamous. As Leila Ahmed states in her work, Women and Gender in Islam, [...] "evidence suggests that among the types of marriage practiced was matrilineal, uxorilocal marriage, found in Arabia, including Mecca, about the time of the birth of Muhammad (circa 570)--the woman remaining with her tribe, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> could visit or reside with her, and the children belonging to the mother's tribe--as well as polyandrous and polygamous marriages." [...] Thus, it is widely accepted that polygyny was not the only type of matrimony practiced during the jahiliyya (pre-Islamic era), but one part of a highly variegated and diverse pool of matrimony types.|$|E
