He becomes ambushed and cornered by the raptors, but is rescued by Eric, who managed to survive in an overturned <b>water</b> <b>truck.</b> The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite phone ringing and are reunited with the Kirbys and Billy. Paul explains that he gave the phone to Nash before he was devoured, before the group is attacked by the Spinosaurus. After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy took two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. He decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large aviary used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric by using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and seemingly killed by the Pteranodons. The {{rest of the group}} escapes the aviary, unintentionally leaving the door unlocked. They make their way downriver using a boat.|$|E
500|$|Following El Alamein, the 9th Armoured Brigade was {{withdrawn}} first to Cairo {{and then to}} Syria for internal security duties, where it remained throughout 1942 and 1943. In May 1944, it reached the Italian Front and was placed {{under the command of}} Major-General Charles F. Keightley's 78th [...] "Battleaxe" [...] Division, then under Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkman's XIII Corps. The RWY was to support the 36th Infantry Brigade, with one squadron in support of each of the brigade's three infantry battalions. In May–June 1944, it took part in the advance on Rome, working its way up in close country between the central mountains and the sea to the west. At one point, the 78th Division withdrew, but outlying elements of the regiment did not get the message and continued forwards. The Corps HQ diary for 23 June records 'RWY <b>water</b> <b>truck</b> reports Vaiano clear of enemy'.|$|E
500|$|Some protesters {{resorted to}} illegal means to {{demonstrate}} {{their opposition to the}} project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M.J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M.J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading [...] "Death to OTA", [...] "Death to [...] Bellmon" [...] and [...] "Death to Bartlett" [...] (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud {{on the side of a}} <b>water</b> <b>truck</b> at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 ($17,900 in [...] dollars) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated [...] "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor." [...] In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief.|$|E

2500|$|At around 06:22, a 19-ton yellow Mercedes-Benz stake-bed truck {{drove to}} the Beirut International Airport. The 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT), {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Larry Gerlach, was a subordinate element of the 24th MAU. The truck was not the <b>water</b> <b>truck</b> they had been expecting. Instead, it was a hijacked truck carrying explosives. The driver turned his truck onto an access road leading to the compound. [...] He drove into and circled the parking lot, and then he accelerated to crash through a 5-foot-high barrier of concertina wire separating the parking lot from the building. The wire popped [...] "like somebody walking on twigs." [...] The truck then passed between two sentry posts and through an open vehicle gate in the perimeter chain-link fence, crashed through a guard shack {{in front of the}} building and smashed into the lobby of the building serving as the barracks for the 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT). The sentries at the gate were operating under rules of engagement which made it very difficult to respond quickly to the truck. On the day of the bombing, the sentries were ordered to keep a loaded magazine inserted in their weapon, bolt closed, weapon on safe and no round in the chamber. Only one sentry, LCpl Eddie DiFranco, was able to chamber a round. [...] However, by that time the truck was already crashing into the building's entryway.|$|E

2500|$|Although a 2005 court {{settlement}} gave Nestlé {{the right to}} pump 250 gallons per minute (GPM) from a well in unincorporated Osceola Township, Osceola County, Michigan, Nestlé has tried to increase that rate to 400 GPM. Its bottled water is sold under the Ice Mountain Spring label. The local planning commission denied the application to build a booster station to increase {{the capacity of the}} pipeline that delivers water to a <b>water</b> <b>truck</b> depot some distance from the town. Local citizens mounted considerable grassroots opposition to the plan, with 55 opponents testifying against the proposal at a meeting attended by almost 500 people in July, 2017. The litigation has been costly to the small town, which receives its only compensation from a $200 annual pumping fee. Regarding the 1976 Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, section 17, a measure precipitated by Nestlé's previous demands, Bill Cobbs, a current Democratic gubernatorial candidate said, [...] "This is wrong -- when this act was written in 1976 it was never intentioned that water would be up for sale." [...] The [...] "David vs. Goliath" [...] situation is drawing increasing national attention. Nestlé approaches water purely as a commodity. In 1994 Helmut Maucher, Nestlé's CEO commented, “Springs are like petroleum. You can always build a chocolate factory. But springs you have or you don’t have.” His successor, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, was criticized when, in a 2005 documentary, he similarly promoted and rationalized the commodification of water, saying: “One perspective held by various NGOs—which I would call extreme—is that water should be declared a human right.|$|E
