5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E

5000|$|On 10 June, Jill Bähring, a {{woman whom}} three {{witnesses}} {{claimed to have}} seen being abused, flatly denied the abuse allegations. In a statement released by Gizmodo journalist William Turton, Bähring wrote: [...] "Reading this highly distorted version of my experience, which is being used {{as one of the}} 'bulletproof examples' of Jacob's alleged misbehavior, I can’t help but <b>wonder.</b> <b>Wonder</b> <b>about</b> all the stories that have been published the last days. <b>Wonder</b> not only <b>about</b> mob justice on twitter, caused by rumors and speculation, but also about the accounts repeated by those who call themselves journalists. <b>Wonder</b> <b>about</b> how many other stories have been willingly misinterpreted. <b>Wonder</b> <b>about</b> the witnesses in all these stories, who coincidentally always seem to consist of the same set of people. <b>Wonder</b> <b>about</b> their motive to speak on my behalf without my consent." ...|$|R

With the rain came a little lightning, and by the first flash he saw her clearly. Her beautiful face was set, and as she bent forward searching the darkness with her wide eyes, it wore, he thought, an almost defiant air.|$|R

In the course of doing so, the review questions her sweeping away ‘the subject’; questions her hard-and-fast distinctions between phenomenology and Whitehead’s metaphysics and voices <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> her neglecting complementarities between phenomenology and Whitehead’s metaphysics; questions the validity of her claims about ‘where phenomenology goes wrong’; <b>wonders</b> <b>about</b> the absence of kinesthesia and its qualitative dynamics in what she writes of human movement; and finally <b>wonders</b> <b>about</b> her non-substantiated claims about ontogeny...|$|R
25|$|On 22 April German {{newspaper}} Bild {{announced that}} contestant Max Buskohl quit the competition due to RTL's rejection of his request {{to let his}} school band Empty Trash get a recording contract alongside him. Viewers had <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> judge Dieter Bohlen's uncharacteristic behaviour when he gave an extremely critical review of Buskohl's performance on 21 April. Buskohl {{is alleged to have}} said that Bohlen was asocial, which explains Bohlen's negative reaction. Contestant Martin Stosch, who was eliminated on 21 April, remained as a contestant despite being voted off the week prior, replacing Buskohl. However, Buskohl's father Carl Carlton told Spiegel Online that his son already made his decision to leave on 19 April but waited until Sunday to make his announcement at request of RTL.|$|E
25|$|Woodruff Randolph {{hand-picked}} the Progressives {{to run for}} {{executive council}} in 1958, which would control the ITU for nearly twenty years. At the same time United States Senator John McClellan (D - AR) was investigating organized crime in labor unions. When Dave Beck, president of the Teamsters, resigned in 1957—near the time of Randolph's statement of retirement—many ITU members <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> their long-time leader. The new ITU President Elmer Brown meekly appeared before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management. Brown had been ITU second Vice-President (1944–1949) and had served in various offices in his home local, New York Typographical #6 (1945–1957). Brown claimed that during the 1957 ITU convention, Randolph requested Brown run {{for president of the}} ITU. Brown told the committee that he had not been aware of events in Indianapolis since he left the Executive Council. Randolph retired to his homes in Indiana and Florida, October 1, 1966, he died in the Union Printers Home.|$|E
25|$|At the French Open, Hantuchová lost in {{the second}} round in a {{marathon}} match to Harkleroad again, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–9, making 101 unforced errors, leading to long-time coach Nigel Sears criticising her attitude publicly. Following the match, her extremely thin physique was noticed for the first time publicly, and some <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> Hantuchová's health. Kicking off the grass season in Eastbourne, Hantuchová {{lost in the}} quarterfinals to Conchita Martínez, but more famously she lost {{in the second round}} of Wimbledon to Shinobu Asagoe, 6–0, 4–6, 10–12, with Hantuchová breaking down crying during the latter stages of the match and making 57 unforced errors. Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walked out during the middle of the match, led to this breakdown. Following Wimbledon, Hantuchová went 6–8 for the rest of the year, 0–4 against top-10 players She ended the year with an overall record of 28–23, and she fell to No. 17 in the world. Further signs of the pressure and problems she was facing during this period was that, in July, she made herself unavailable for Slovakia in the Fed Cup, in order to concentrate on her singles career, and in November she parted company with Sears.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, [...] "It's what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E

Chaney and Slezak both <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the extra girls in the number, but Lynch simply said, [...] "Nice {{to get a little}} Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions". Lynch's grade was a [...] "B", in part because Mercedes's voice [...] "seemed strangely buried".|$|E

[...] He felt that the episode had [...] "all the classic elements of fiction", and lauded Robert C. Cooper's storytelling idea to take the Stargate from the SGC and Don S.

[...] In Storm's mind, the visual effects were well-placed and did not overthrow the story, but he <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "ubiquitous Sam/Jack interest".

500|$|Also {{writing for}} Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme {{was worried about}} how much Kira's and Athrun's {{relationship}} would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked that Lacus Clyne's introduction added tension to it.

He said, [...] "If that's real, this story may be more interesting than I thought..." [...] Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira's and Athrun's rivalry which resulted in well-done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira {{to be similar to}} other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the [...] "reluctant hero".|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was listed}} on The New York Times Best Seller list, the book {{received}} poor reviews {{from the popular}} press, although better reviews from Hemingway scholars. In a pre-publication review for The New York Times, Ralph Blumenthal said that True at First Light was {{not as good as}} Hemingway's earlier autobiographical fiction, and he questioned whether Hemingway would have wanted his [...] "reputation and last printed words entrusted solely to any editor, even a son". Blumenthal <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the autobiographical aspects of the work: the relationship between Hemingway and Debba; the background of the Look magazine photoshoot; the safari itself; and the subsequent plane accidents. In the 1999 The New York Times review, James Wood claimed Hemingway knew True at First Light was not a novel though the editors billed it as one. He believes Hemingway's later work became a parody of the earlier work. [...] True at First Light represents the worst of Hemingway's work according to a review in The Guardian.|$|E

500|$|By 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson characterized it as [...] "flagrant propaganda" [...] that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the [...] "silencing of birds"—to pesticide overuse. That was also {{the year of the}} [...] "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ignition Entertainment director of business development Shane Bettehausen, Alex Lucard of Diehard GameFan said that North American SNK fans detested Ash and complained about his inclusion in The King of Fighters XII without a storyline while popular series characters were overlooked. Bettehausen defended the character, calling him [...] "nuanced and improved" [...] and his moves [...] "incredibly effective". In June 2009, Stephen Totilo of Kotaku interviewed Bettehausen, who asked him while Totilo was playing to guess Ash's gender. When Totilo said the character was female, Betehausen called KOF [...] "progressive" [...] in introducing a cross-dressing character and said that fans were apparently [...] "warming up to him". On Destructoid, Jonathan Holmes praised Ash's character as [...] "defying traditional gender roles while kicking some ass" [...] and called him [...] "the perfect mascot for the KoF series as a whole."

500|$|Madonna: Like an Icon was {{released}} on 27 August 2007, in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press. The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald, with an image of Madonna from 2002, during the premiere of her film, Swept Away. It {{was released}} {{more than a year}} later in the United States. The biography faced mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O'Brien's extended commentary about Madonna's recording process. She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna's personal life as well. Pointing out examples like Madonna's relationship with actor Warren Beatty, which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book, Churchwell <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the claim of the book in its press release: [...] "This is the closest you will ever come to Madonna's autobiography". The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "Since her voice is nowhere in evidence, this book, however capable and intelligent its writer, is probably about the farthest you will ever get from Madonna's autobiography." ...|$|E

It was something you hadn’t seen, or wanted to see or <b>wondered</b> <b>about,</b> so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle."

That's her {{prerogative}} as an artist, and it's certainly earned. But it underscores the one thing we've always <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> Rihanna — what is she really feeling?". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats really do have nine lives". Idolator reviewer Becky Bain praised Minaj's [...] "infectious and energetic verse" [...] and felt the song's rhythm [...] "fits Nicki's quirkiness perfectly".|$|E

[...] Years later, Gene Derricotte would tell a reporter friend of his that he always <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> his ancestry. [...] He knew his name was French, but {{he was not able to}} find out much more about his roots. [...] One thing he must have known was that despite living under segregation, other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals. A black newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, did a tribute to the family in November 1944, mentioning that Eugene's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business, marry and raise a family. [...] Eugene had an uncle (J.
