5|$|The QuickWindow case {{accessory}} for the G2 {{was unveiled}} on 30 July 2013—prior to {{the unveiling of}} the phone itself. The QuickWindow case consists of a plastic shell with a polyurethane flip cover. The cover contains a rounded rectangular <b>window</b> <b>that</b> exposes {{a portion of the}} display, allowing a number of functions to be accessed without opening the cover, including notifications, a customizable clock, and a music player.|$|E
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above the door is an oculus <b>window</b> <b>that</b> originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills. The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor windows are modern but within the original openings.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the statue}} and framed by marble pilasters is a <b>window</b> <b>that</b> depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's {{tympanum}} is a depiction of Independence Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's {{treaty with the}} Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Convention, the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay <b>window</b> <b>that</b> projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|At the school, {{they find}} a secure {{building}} and leave Randall there with a knife. As they leave, Randall pleads to take them back, and then says {{he had gone to}} school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a <b>window</b> <b>that</b> releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They regag Randall and return to the farm. Rick tells Shane that he will need to follow his orders to remain part of the group.|$|E

5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The <b>window</b> <b>that</b> was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a <b>window</b> <b>that</b> looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} first four novels of the Harry Potter fantasy series by J. K. Rowling for a seven-figure sum,after a pitch from producer David Heyman. Warner Bros. took particular notice of Rowling's wishes and thoughts about the films when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was that they be shot in Britain with an all-British cast, which has been generally adhered to. On 8 August 2000, the virtually unknown Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Chris Columbus was hired to direct the film adaptation ofPhilosopher's Stone,with Steve Kloves selected to write the screenplay. Filming began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July. Principal photography took place on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station.Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production <b>window</b> <b>that</b> several proposed directors removed themselves from consideration. Because of time constraints, the date was put back, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 16 November 2001.|$|E

25|$|In a rural {{home the}} living room was {{enlarged}} so the weaver could benefit from heat from the single hearth.
