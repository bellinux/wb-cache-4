In September 2006, he {{captured}} {{his first and}} only title with the company, the United States Championship, and would {{hold on to it}} for a month. The following year at WrestleMania 23, Anderson won the annual Money in the Bank ladder match, a contract, which guarantees a match for one of WWE's then three world level championships.

5|$|In a dispute, the {{architectural}} firm of Miller and Pflueger <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the project, {{and was replaced}} by Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was little changed from Pflueger's original.

25|$|Two bullet casings {{were found}} by a {{civilian}} under {{a police car}} after it was driven away. The casings found suggested that only two shots <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at the motorcade. Their assembly also suggested that they <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> home-made guns. It is unclear {{as to whether they}} <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the same gun, or from different guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{cavalier}} {{was also}} used as a gun signalling station. Three rounds <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> every day, at sunrise, noon and sunset.

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E

The band toured and gained a following, signing with the independent label Combat Records in late 1984. Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), sold {{very well for}} an independent release, and the group {{attracted the attention of}} major record labels. By the end of the year, the group signed with Capitol Records. Megadeth's first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986.|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{has been}} forced to declare the {{championship}} vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the third}} match, Larry Zybysko {{revealed}} that Raven's opponent {{for the night}} was Sean Waltman. The two then fought in a No Disqualification match with the stipulation that if Raven won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, but if he lost he would be fired from TNA. During the bout, the referee was knocked out with Zbyszko taking over his duties. Waltman won the contest after forcing Raven face-first off of a ladder through a table with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Zbyszko counted the pin despite Raven's foot on the bottom rope at 10 minutes. As {{a result of his}} loss, Raven <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> TNA in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Gailey's most {{successful}} year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship. The Yellow Jackets football team reached its first New Year's Bowl since the 1999 Gator Bowl {{and played the}} West Virginia Mountaineers in the Gator Bowl. Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33-3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team slid to finish 7-6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Yellow Jackets, two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult. After {{a year in}} the role, Engen {{announced}} his exit from The Young and the Restless because of objections over his storyline, and Michael Muhney was recast in the role. Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, saying he was unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016.|$|E

5|$|In May 2006, an {{anonymous}} {{letter from the}} Ministry of Information was circulated within the party, stating Ranariddh's purported intention {{to form a new}} royalist party. Nhek Bun Chhay followed the issue closely and provided a list of party members who were planning to defect from Funcinpec, which included Serey Kosal and Chakrapong. At the same time, Nhek Bun Chhay appointed Nouv Sovathero party spokesman, while re-designating the then-incumbent party spokesman Chea Chanboribo the personal spokesman for Ranariddh. The cascade of incidents from Nhek Bun Chhay stoked anger from Serey Kosal and Chakrapong who threatened to sue him. When Ranariddh <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> his position as the president of Funcinpec in October 2006, Chakrapong was also expelled from the party and senate the following month.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Levene <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Clash. Strummer {{would claim}} that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of the Sex Pistols during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E

5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the journal).|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season {{opened with}} the Devils' roster {{suffering}} with injuries, and consequently the team accumulated losses. On December 26, Peter DeBoer <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> {{the head coach}} position. To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and Adam Oates, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months. The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and with just one victory in the last 11 games.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} {{different}} artworks released for the album, each which completed one-fourth of a map, that when put together, illustrates the earth painted with red. There are eleven tracks on the album, with origins illustrating death and destruction, war, serial killers, and the Apocalypse. It is the band's first studio album {{to be played}} mostly in E-flat tuning since Divine Intervention.
