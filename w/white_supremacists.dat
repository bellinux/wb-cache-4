5|$|The ship's {{activities}} or owner {{are not known}} after her sale, but Ozark transported Federal troops and New Orleans police attempting to apprehend the <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> who killed {{a large number of}} blacks during the Colfax Massacre in 1873. She ferried witnesses back and forth to their homes on the Red River during the subsequent trials in 1874. Her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|After {{tracking}} the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation {{of the wealthy}} Spencer Bennett and killing them, the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz and becomes his apprentice. Later that evening, the duo are hunted by Spencer Bennett and a large gang of <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> (a reference to the early Ku Klux Klan), but Dr. Schultz deceives and kills most of Bennett's gang with an explosive and Django kills Bennett. Dr. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and feels morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the flyer for good luck.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>supremacist</b> {{recruitment}} {{activities are}} primarily conducted at a grassroots level {{as well as}} on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> websites. The Internet provides a venue to openly express <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> ideas at little social cost, because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.|$|R
50|$|The Daily Caller has {{published}} articles by Jason Kessler, a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> who organized a rally {{of hundreds of}} white nationalists in Charlottesville. Before Kessler published his article, it was known that he had spoken at <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> gatherings. After Kessler received attention for his organizing of the Charlottesville <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> rally, the Daily Caller removed his articles from its website.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Creativity Movement (formerly the World Church of the Creator), led by Matthew F. Hale, is {{associated}} with violence and bigotry. Aryan Nations is another religiously-based <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> hate group.|$|R
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna {{as a witness}} to the murder of a girl by <b>white</b> <b>supremacists.</b> While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E
5|$|W. Harry Davis, {{who later}} served 20 {{years on the}} Minneapolis School Board, agreed {{to run for mayor}} in 1971, {{becoming}} the city's first black mayoral candidate supported by a major political party. <b>White</b> <b>supremacists</b> were still present in Minneapolis, and threatened his family daily during the campaign. The police department guarded their home and the FBI gave them protection dogs. Davis also received support from white politicians including Humphrey, Donald M. Fraser, and Walter Mondale. Twenty years later, Minneapolis elected its first African American mayor, Sharon Sayles Belton. To date, she has been the city's only non-white mayor.|$|E
5|$|<b>White</b> <b>supremacists,</b> {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|E
50|$|Robert Jay Mathews, American neo-Nazi {{terrorist}} and {{the leader}} of The Order (<b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> group), an American <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> militant group, died on Whidbey Island during a shoot-out with federal law enforcement agents.|$|R
5000|$|Kinists {{differ from}} other <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Christian sects, such as Christian Identity and Creativity: [...] "What sets Kinists apart from many other <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> groups is their embrace of a biblical Christianity that has {{universal}} salvation through Jesus at its core. Many other <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> groups reject Christianity completely or, {{when they do}} practice Christianity, adhere {{to a form of}} the religion that recognizes only whites as capable of receiving salvation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} said in August 2016 that Roof was [...] "self-radicalized" [...] online, instead of adopting his <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> ideology [...] "through his personal associations or experiences with <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> groups or individuals or others".|$|R
5|$|The {{identity}} of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark {{was still in}} service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre. Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December. Prosecution witnesses were transported and housed in the ship during the trials in February–March 1874 {{to protect them from}} threats made by <b>white</b> <b>supremacists.</b> Nothing further is known about the Ozarks activities or fate.|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E
5000|$|TYN was {{established}} in May 2013 by Matthew Heimbach and Matt Parrott. Heimbach has been a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> activist since fall 2011, when he formed a group at Towson University in Maryland and invited the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Jared Taylor to speak at Towson's campus. The following year, Heimbach founded a [...] "White Student Union" [...] on campus, adopting racist and antisemitic views. [...] In spring 2013, upon graduation, Heimbach established TYN in partnership with Parrot, who founded a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> group, Hoosier Nation, in Indiana around 2009. [...] Parrot is also a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist.</b> The group eventually became a chapter of American Third Position (later known as the American Freedom Party).|$|R

5000|$|Richard Bertrand Spencer (born May 11, 1978) is an American <b>white</b> <b>supremacist.</b> He is {{president}} of the National Policy Institute, a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> think tank, as well as Washington Summit Publishers. Spencer has stated that he rejects the label of <b>white</b> <b>supremacist,</b> and prefers to describe himself as an identitarian. He has advocated for a white homeland for a [...] "dispossessed white race" [...] and called for [...] "peaceful ethnic cleansing" [...] to halt the [...] "deconstruction" [...] of European culture.|$|R
5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E
25|$|Some {{participants}} who arrived early held an all-night vigil outside the Department of Justice, claiming it had unfairly targeted {{civil rights activists}} {{and that it had}} been too lenient on <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> who attacked them.|$|E
25|$|During the 2016 {{election}} season, site founder Don Black {{said that}} the site was experiencing huge spikes in traffic corresponding to controversial statements by Donald Trump, who is popular among <b>white</b> <b>supremacists.</b> In response, Black upgraded the site's servers.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is {{the group}} most {{associated}} with the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> movement. Many <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> groups {{are based on the}} concept of preserving genetic purity, and they do not focus solely on discrimination based on skin color. The KKK's reasons for supporting racial segregation are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly Protestant. The KKK and other <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> groups like Aryan Nations, The Order and the White Patriot Party are considered antisemitic.|$|R
50|$|Jamie Kelso (June 8, 1948) is an American <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> {{and former}} Church of Scientology {{member of the}} elite Sea Org. He hosts daily web radio programs, {{including}} The Jamie Kelso Show on the Voice of Reason Broadcast Network, and is a senior moderator of the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Stormfront website, where he uses the name Charles A. Lindberg. Kelso became a moderator at Stormfront in 2002 and was instrumental in its rapid growth, partially by encouraging senior figures in the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> movement to post.|$|R
50|$|The Boston {{memorial}} {{as well as}} the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. {{was targeted}} for destruction in a 2002 <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> terror plot by a neo-Nazi and his <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> girlfriend. At 2002 federal trial, the jury convicted both defendants on all counts.|$|R
25|$|Buckley and his editors {{used his}} {{magazine}} {{to define the}} boundaries of conservatism—and to exclude people or ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. Therefore, he denounced Ayn Rand, the John Birch Society, George Wallace, racists, <b>white</b> <b>supremacists,</b> and anti-Semites.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust Museum {{has been}} a target for antisemites and Holocaust deniers since it was {{established}} in 1993.

Sexual assault of migrants from Latin America to the United States is also a form of attack on migrants perpetrated by smugglers, gang members, government officials, bandits, or other migrants.|$|E
25|$|The Klan has {{expanded}} its recruitment efforts to <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> at the international level. For some time, the Klan's numbers have been steadily dropping. This decline {{has been attributed to}} the Klan's lack of competence {{in the use of the}} Internet, their history of violence, a proliferation of competing hate groups, and a decline in the number of young racist activists who are willing to join groups at all.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, The A.V. Club posted an {{analysis}} of the scene where Zev meets the character John Kurlander. The review noted some surface-level similarities between Norris' work as John and his role as Hank Schrader on Breaking Bad, but its main focus was on how events in 2016 and growing vocalization of <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> served to make the scene much more disturbing and realistic than it felt when the film premiered in 2015.|$|E
