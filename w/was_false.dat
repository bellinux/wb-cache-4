5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's rule is a {{necessary}} consequence of {{a particular set of}} axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this <b>was</b> <b>false</b> for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.|$|E

Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory <b>was</b> <b>false.</b> He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in the attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim <b>was</b> <b>false</b> because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account <b>was</b> <b>false.</b> Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk.

5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news <b>was</b> <b>false</b> and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story <b>was</b> <b>false.</b> Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
5|$|During the 1580s, Coke became intimately {{linked with}} the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel. His uncle Thomas Gawdy had close links to Earl Arundel himself. In Norfolk Arundel held a liberty– he was {{essentially}} a local prince who appointed all officials, maintained his own prison, executed justice and bribed any royal clerks. His power base was his household, particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together. Coke's uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke traveled to Cardiff to answer a challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke's three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard– he proved that Dacre's evidence <b>was</b> <b>false</b> and had the case dismissed.|$|E

Thus, the following paradox can be generated: The first declarative sentence, which is a declaration (khabar) about itself, namely that it <b>is</b> <b>false,</b> <b>is</b> either <b>false</b> or true.

5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client <b>was</b> <b>false.</b> Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted to make {{his way back to the}} French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which <b>was</b> <b>false.</b> The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information <b>was</b> <b>false,</b> because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E

This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon receiving information from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters (including Vince McMahon) were known to regularly inflate attendance figures to make things look better. While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans {{as to what the}} true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.|$|E
5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!” Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor <b>was</b> <b>false,</b> however, and caused little excitement in the campaign.|$|E
