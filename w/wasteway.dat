2500|$|The Columbia Basin Project {{in central}} Washington changed the {{character}} of Crab Creek substantially. The Crab Creek irrigation-return drainage basin covers an irrigated area of 296mi² (767km²). A large earthfill dam, the O'Sullivan Dam (also {{referred to as the}} Potholes Dam) was constructed from 1947 to 1949, forming Potholes Reservoir, which serves as a central point in the CBP for storage of irrigation water, natural runoff, and irrigation-return flow, allowing irrigation water reuse throughout the southern CBP area. Potholes Reservoir releases water through canals and has no perennial outlet to Lower Crab Creek. Hence today the water in Lower Crab Creek comes from ground-water seepage from Potholes Reservoir and irrigation, from the Goose Lake <b>Wasteway,</b> and from tributary inflows downstream of the O’Sullivan Dam. [...] The water table in this section is variable but generally high due to the low elevation and irrigation runoff. Many lakes, including Merry, Lenice and Nunally Lakes, drain into Crab Creek.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} about fifteen years since soil {{bioengineering}} and bioengineering technology {{have been used in}} projects to protect slopes and river banks against erosion in the U. S. Now many consulting firms as well as state and federal agencies promote and practice these techniques. Despite a widespread support of these techniques, many projects have failed. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to develop a set of design guidelines to ensure a higher rate of success. In order to develop design guidelines for soil bioengineering and bioengineering technology, a pilot study was conducted to determine the amount of work already done in these areas, and to define the existing research needs. This report comprises (a) a summary of literature review, (b) interviews with eleven practitioners in the field, (c) an evaluation of three projects done in Minnesota, (d) current research needs, (e) and a brief evaluation of three sites {{in the vicinity of the}} Twin Cities area as potential outdoor laboratories to conduct research in the needed areas. It also includes a summary of a site visit of the Department of Soil Bioengineering and Landscape Construction at the University of Agricultural Sciences in Vienna, Austria. The study shows that a significant number of studies have been done on topics related to soil bioengineering techniques. However, these studies mainly address the problems at a micro scale, and hence, there is a gap between existing knowledge and practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to not only study some of the fundamental processes and mechanisms involved in soil bioengineering techniques, but also to investigate these processes at a macro scale to evaluate their strengths and impacts when applied to streambanks and slopes. Main highlights of the research needs identified in this study were a) quantifying the bank and bed roughness with the most common plants used in bioengineering techniques, b) studying the added shear strength to banks by vegetation, c) determining the resiliency of different plants under high flow conditions, e) understanding the mechanisms which cause failure of plants under different flow conditions, f) quantifying the shear strength of the commonly used techniques for a range of bank slopes, top soil depths and soil types, and g) determining the shear strength of composite systems, where different plants and techniques are combined. To conduct research in the needed areas three sites were identified and evaluated as potential outdoor research facilities in the vicinity of the Twin Cities area, Minnesota. The three candidate sites were (1) the two abandoned <b>wasteways</b> near the Falls of St. Anthony located adjacent to the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, (2) a 7 acre area in the northern part of the UMore Park, a University of Minnesota property allocated for research, and (3) a short reach of the Vermillion River near Empire, MN, located on private property.

40|$|In 2008, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{evaluated}} the Hofer Dam fish screen and provided technical assistance at two other fish passage sites as {{requested by the}} Bonneville Power Administration, the Walla Walla Watershed Council, or the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Evaluation of new sites such as Hofer Dam focuses on their design, construction, operation, and maintenance {{to determine if they}} effectively provide juvenile salmonids with safe passage through irrigation diversions. There were two requests for technical assistance in 2008. In the first, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation requested an evaluation of the Nursery Bridge fish screens associated with the fish ladder {{on the east side of}} the Walla Walla River. One set of brushes that clean the screens was broken for an extended period. Underwater videography and water velocity measurements were used to determine there were no potential adverse effects on juvenile salmonids when the west set of screens was clean enough to pass water normally. A second request, received from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Walla Walla Watershed Council, asked for evaluation of water velocities through relatively new head gates above and adjacent to the Eastside Ditch fish screens on the Walla Walla River. Water moving through the head gates and not taken for irrigation is diverted to provide water for the Nursery Bridge fish ladder on the east side of the river. Elevations used in the design of the head gates were incorrect, causing excessive flow through the head gates that closely approached or exceeded the maximum swimming burst speed of juvenile salmonids. Hofer Dam was evaluated in June 2008. PNNL researchers found that conditions at Hofer Dam will not cause impingement or entrainment of juvenile salmonids but may provide habitat for predators and lack strong sweeping flows to encourage juvenile salmonid passage downstream. Further evaluation of velocities at the Eastside Ditch and <b>wasteway</b> gates should occur as changes are made to compensate for the design problems. These evaluations will help determine whether further changes are required. Hofer Dam also should be evaluated again under more normal operating conditions when the river levels are typical of those when fish are emigrating and the metal plate is not affecting flows...|$|E
40|$|For many people, {{recycling}} is a habitual environmental action. In recent years, however, critics {{have shown that}} municipal recycling programs are not always environmentally beneficial. Municipal waste management programs are, nevertheless, a key lever through which cities can influence material consumption, which is a driver of ecological overshoot and greenhouse gas emissions. Through transformation of municipal waste management, including and beyond the adoption of expanded recycling programs, cities can potentially reduce their environmental footprints. In the U. S., some cities {{seem to have been}} able to do this, and while most have not. This dissertation asks why. Specifically, I ask if Seattle, a city known for its progressive waste programming, is substantially different from Boston, a city with relatively average waste and recycling programs-beyond the superficial metric of diversion rate. If so, how? Further, what enabled Seattle to fundamentally change its complex, socio-technical waste system? I find that the cities do differ meaningfully. Seattle's high diversion rate is a signal of deeper institutional changes to its waste system that position the city in opposition to dominant regimes of waste generation and management in the U. S. To compare the two cities, I use a combination of grounded theory and process tracing techniques to analyze archival data, interviews with system actors, and local press from 1980 to 2016. Building on Zsuzsa's Gille's theory of waste regimes, I argue that the U. S. is dominated by a "weak recycling waste regime" that prioritizes hygiene, sanitation, and efficiency, while allowing limited post-consumer recycling of a few materials-paper, glass, metal, and plastic-regardless of the environmental efficacy of doing so. This regime is a product of the sanitary engineering discipline, the demands of a consumption-driven capitalist economy, and the influence of manufacturers seeking to avoid more invasive environmental regulation; it depends on rapid disposal and relatively invisible garbage. Boston operates well within the parameters of this regime. Seattle, on the other hand, has fundamentally reoriented its waste system towards goals of waste reduction and resource stewardship. Seattle and Boston's waste systems differ in many ways, but the key difference lies not in organizational or infrastructural distinction, but in how each city responded to a disposal crisis in the early 1980 s. Seattle's crisis led to a wide open public dialogue about garbage, through which the problem of waste in the city was redefined. Traditional problem frames of sanitation and disposal gave way to new problem frames about the value of the materials in the waste stream and the environmental costs of squandering them through incineration or burial in a landfill. The inclusive, public redefinition process led to a new set of institutions for governing waste, from legislated waste reduction goals, to autonomy for programmatic experimentation, to-slowly over time-new roles for citizens and state. Instead of being locked in a service-provider-client relationship, Seattle's waste programs treat residents as partners in a project of resource stewardship, and cast the city government as both a responsible consumer and a programmatic innovator. Through this process, Seattle has achieved a remarkable recycling rate, but more importantly, has instituted curbside food scrap composting, nudged residents towards deeper engagement with their discards, and experimented successfully with restricting the use of toxic and hard-to-recycle materials. In Boston, on the other hand, from the moment of crisis through 2016, the city's waste managers retained traditional views of garbage and the project of waste management. Limited planning and limited input have served to maintain focus on conventional concerns about cleanliness, sanitation, and efficient disposal. As predicted by the waste regime, the city has a minimal recycling program that conforms to industry standards. I conceptualize the key differences between Seattle and Boston through a framework of wasteways. The term is borrowed from sewer engineering and redefined to provide a framework for understanding how unique municipal waste systems relate to dominant waste regimes. The transformation that took place in Seattle during the 1980 s gave rise to an alternative <b>wasteway</b> [...] a system that is institutionally organized to resist the waste regime. Within Boston's mainstream <b>wasteway,</b> on the other hand, the city's waste system has operated, from the disposal crisis moving forward, as we would expect given the dominant regime. Analyzing municipal wasteways-a framework that can be applied to any city in any context, and could be expanded to include other urban systems-draws attention to the institutional changes that support infrastructural change. Recycling alone may not be sufficient to achieve sustainable materials practice, but the underlying institutional evolution in Seattle suggests that cities can achieve bold-even radical-changes to material practices at the urban scale. 4 by Lily Baum Pollans.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Boru iletim hatları sanayinin gelişmesiyle birçok alanda kullanılmaya başlamıştır. Enerji iletim hatları, kanalizasyon, içme ve sulama suyu hatları, elektrik, vb. birçok mühendislik yapılarında gömülü boru hatları kullanılmaktadır. Gömülü boruların çeşitli alanlarda kullanılması araştırmacıların dikkatini çekmiştir. Dolayısıyla bu konuda yüzlerce araştırma yapılmıştır. Gömülü boruların yük altında davranışları incelenip, daha mukavim borular elde edilmeye çalışılmıştır. Böylece daha ekonomik ve daha dayanıklı borular üretilebilmektedir. Akışkanların düşük seviyeli basınçlarda nakli için çeşitli plastik malzemelerden, o cümleden HDPE (Yüksek Yoğunluklu Polietilen) ’den yapılmış farklı profilli (eksenel kesitli) korige borular yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadırlar. Korige borular genel olarak silindirik kabukların dış yüzeylerine farklı profilli ince duvarlı(cidar kalınlıklı) bantların sarılması, birkaç silindirik kabuğun içiçe konsentrik yerleştirilmesi ve pozisyonlarının uygun ara elemanları ile sabitlendirilmesi yöntemleri ile yapılabilirler. Değişik şekillerde yapılan ara elemanları ilgili kabukların pozisyonlarının sabitlendirilmesi dışında borunun mukavemetinin artmasını da sağlar. Korige borular tasarımları bakımından önemli faklılıklar gösterdiklerinden gerilme şekil değiştirme durumlarının hassas olarak incelenmesi için genel bir analitik yöntemin geliştirilmesi yönündeki çalışmalar kabul edilebilir bir zaman aralığında efektif sonuçlar vermeyebilir. Bazı yapılarda sayısal yöntemlerle alınmış sonuçlar mevcuttur fakat onların genelleştirilmesinin özel karakterli olduklarından verimsiz olacağı muhtemeldir. Problemin etkin çözüm yöntemlerinden biri incelemelerin rijitliği ilgili korige borunun rijitliğine eşit seçilmiş sürekli ve sabit enkesitli (düz) borular üzerinde yapılması olabilir. Korige borular gömülü durumda, ağırlıklı olarak, düşey yöndeki yüklerin etkisindedir.

Pipeline {{transmission lines}} {{began to be}} used in many areas by development of industry. Buried pipelines are used in many engineering structures such as power transmission lines, <b>wasteway,</b> drinking and irrigation water lines, electricity, etc. Embedded pipes used in various fields has attracted the attention of researchers. On this account, research has been done about it hundreds. Examined the behavior of buried pipes under the load, tried to be more resistant pipes. In this way, pipes can be manufactured more economically and more resistant. Corrugated pipes made from different plastic materials with a various types of axially sectioned profiles are widely used for fluid transportation at lower pressures, for inctance from this group high density polyethylene. Corrugated pipes, in general, are produced wrapping thin-walled tapes having different types of profile over outer surfaces of cylindrical shells, concentrically placing a number of cylindrical shells and fixing their positions with appropriate connection elements. Produced these connection elements in a different types not only allow to fix the related cylindrical shells but also to increase the strength of pipes. The high-density polyethylene pipe has good potential for economic use for marine oil and gas pipelines, underdrains, storm sewers, culverts, and other subsurface drainage structures. In view of its inherent chemical and corrosion resistance, light weight, toughness, flexibility, easy splicing, and consequent easy handling and installation, HDPE piping is used extensively for gas pipelines. In the transportation industry, over forty states in the US use HDPE pipes as part of a 40 % annual growth in the use of thermoplastic, HDPE and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes in transportation construction projects. The efforts in order to develop a general analytical method for the precise examination of state of strain-stress of corrugated pipes may not give effective results in an acceptable period of time since pipes significantly display differences in terms of design. Some results obtained using numerical methods exist, but the generalization is likely to be inefficient due to their special characters. One of the effective solution methods of the problem can be that taking the stiffness of cross section of the related corrugated pipe is equal to another continuous and constant (flat) one. As it known, corrugated pipes in embedded cases mainly are subjected to vertical loads. In this respect, state of strain of pipelines traditionally, in general are evaluated with the tests carried out under the influence of vertical loads, equal intensity but in the opposite directions in the diametrical plane. Therefore, the examination of state of strain-stress of thin-walled finite cylindrical shells under the equal distributed loads in the opposite directions in the diametrical plane may be useful. High density polyethylene has an increasingly important role for the pipe industry. These materials offer many advantages such as lower density, resistance to corrosion and chemicals, relatively low cost and ease of processing that they have been permanently replacing conventional materials. There are some studies about the plastic pipes and pipe-soil interaction in the technical literature. Reddy et al. defined the maximum tangential stress locations as the shoulder which was above 45 ° springline. It was stated by Moore that highest circumferential stresses were located at the springline. Moser and Folkman stated that dimpling occurs generally at 3 and 9 o clock positions in the field performance tests of profile-wall HDPE pipes and beginning of wall crushing observed at the 9 : 30 and 2 : 30 o clock positions. Experimental study of Dhar and Moore showed that maximum circumferential strain occurred at springline. McGrat and Schafer stated that maximum compressive circumferential strain occurred at crown and maximum tensile circumferential strain occurred at the springline {{as a result of their}} parallel plate simulation. Burgon and Keatley showed that maximum stress locations were at the springline. There is a need for the detailed investigation of state of stress for the buried pipe problems experimentally. In this study, buried HDPE pipes were investigated using photoelasticity which allows analyzing in details state of stress on the buried pipe model. Investigations are carried out for the photoelastic plane models taking into account the analogy between plane state of stress and strain and independency of state of stress from Poisson’s ratio in plane stress. Different type of corrugated profile pipes were compared. Also, covered corrugated profile pipes were investigated in terms of the local buckling and different types of strip geometries were analyzed numerically. Buried condition of the pipes is also an important issue and buried pipe was modeled by using photoelasticity in the final part of this study. As a result of the experiment, maximum stress locations in the pipe model were close to crown and about ± 20 ° away from springline in terms of the differences between principal stress values. New and different corrugated pipe is designed by examined the interaction of soil and pipe. Pipe-soil interaction experimentally investigated in detail using photoelastic method. In photoelastic experiment, epoxy resin which the optical sensitive material is used as pipe material. The beech tree is used as soil material. In addition, numerical analysis done with the help of a computer program ABAQUS are compared with the experimental results. The experimental results show great resemblance with the modeling results. The part of the model which imitates the pipe is made of the optical-sensitive material based on epoxy resin (araldite). Material of the model has following optical-mechanical properties: modulus of elasticity, E= 3500 MPa and the fringe value of optical sensitive material &# 963;_ 0 ^ 1. 0 = 9. 57 N/mm&# 8729;fringe. The soil was modeled using wood having porous structure (beech). Parts of the model are prepared using tooling machines with the required specific tools and cooling taking care of no additional optical effect. Specifically, external diameter of the pipe and internal diameter of the wood part of the model are close fit. The part of the model imitating the pipe was placed below the loading surface with a dimension of its inner diameter A set-up consists of a frame was designed and then prepared for loading the model. Base of the model was placed on the horizontal smooth surface. Model was supported from right and left sides with plates which are designed do not prevent from its displacements. The set-up creates uniform axial compressive loading onto the models. Loading of the model was created by a prismatic lever. The load is transferred to the model with a ball. Yüksek LisansM.
