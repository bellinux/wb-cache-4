5|$|On Saint Lucia, <b>wakes</b> {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their <b>wakes</b> on the first and ninth days. <b>Wakes</b> often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for <b>wakes</b> is performed {{both inside and outside}} of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E

40|$|A dynamic <b>wake</b> {{avoidance}} system utilizes {{aircraft and}} atmospheric parameters {{readily available in}} flight to model and predict airborne <b>wake</b> vortices in real time. A novel combination of algorithms allows for a relatively simple yet robust <b>wake</b> model to be constructed based on information extracted from a broadcast. The system predicts the location and movement of the <b>wake</b> based on the nominal <b>wake</b> model and correspondingly performs an uncertainty analysis on the <b>wake</b> model to determine a <b>wake</b> hazard zone (no fly zone), which comprises a plurality of <b>wake</b> planes, each moving independently from another. The system selectively adjusts dimensions of each <b>wake</b> plane to minimize spatial and temporal uncertainty, thereby ensuring that the actual <b>wake</b> is within the <b>wake</b> hazard zone. The predicted <b>wake</b> hazard zone is communicated in real time directly to a user via a realistic visual representation. In an example, the <b>wake</b> hazard zone is visualized on a 3 -D flight deck display to enable a pilot to visualize or see a neighboring aircraft {{as well as its}} <b>wake.</b> The system substantially enhances the pilot's situational awareness and allows for a further safe decrease in spacing, which could alleviate airport and airspace congestion...|$|R

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} <b>wake</b> {{is considered}} {{for a bunch of}} electrons that are suddenly accelerated to an ultrarelativistic velocity. This <b>wake</b> describes the <b>wake</b> of forward transition radiation, and it approximates the edge-radiation <b>wake</b> of a bunch exiting a bending magnet. The <b>wake</b> is large within the radiation formation zone, where it provides resistive impedance. A comparison with the computed <b>wake</b> downstream of a bending magnet yields good agreement, indicating that our <b>wake</b> expressions may be used to approximate the <b>wake</b> without numerical computation. For schemes in which a bunch produced by laser-plasma acceleration exits the plasma and then drives a free electron laser (FEL), the transition-radiation <b>wake</b> causes energy losses of many MeV that may affect the FEL process...|$|R

30|$|The <b>wake</b> {{effect is}} an {{important}} factor in wind farm design. A higher rating of WTs gets more affected by the <b>wake.</b> In case of larger OSWFs, <b>wake</b> effect decreases the total power generation of the wind farm. <b>Wake</b> is the variation of wind speed from weaker to strengthen point behind the WT. The downstream WTs experience the <b>wake</b> effect. The <b>wake</b> effect depends on the allocation of WT in the wind farm. If the distance between the consequent WTs is less, the effect of <b>wake</b> on downstream side WT will be more. In [21], authors have calculated the power loss in OSWF considering turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability. These two parameters strongly affect the <b>wake</b> formation. <b>Wake</b> models are proposed to analyze the <b>wake</b> effects in [22]. Those are Jensen model by N.O.Jensen, Larsen model by G.C. Larsen, Storpark analytical model by Frandsen and Ainslie Model by J.F.Ainslie. Larsen <b>wake</b> model is chosen in this paper to optimize the OSWF.|$|R
40|$|Supersonic <b>wake</b> flows are {{computed}} in both conical and three-dimensional {{full potential}} flows by modeling the <b>wake</b> as a planar {{cut with a}} potential discontinuity. Continuity of pressure is satisfied exactly on the <b>wake</b> cut by computing the necessary potential jump at each <b>wake</b> cut grid point. In the conical <b>wake</b> problem, the jump in potential vanishes in the crossflow symmetry plane. Generally, good correlation is achieved for fully three-dimensional <b>wake</b> flows with the planar <b>wake</b> approximation. Matching pressures in the isolated <b>wake</b> flow leads to small variations in the spanwise jump in potential. On the other hand, a small variation in the jump in potential near the wing tip flow {{can lead to a}} significant loading in the <b>wake</b> flow if the pressures are not matched...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wake</b> {{effects are}} {{important}} to wind turbine design and wind farm design, because they will affect the aerodynamic performance and structural loads of wind turbine operating in a wind farm. <b>Wake</b> effects were investigated extensively for horizontal axis wind turbine(HAWT) in the past, {{but there has been}} very limited work done for the vertical axis wind turbine(VAWT), whose <b>wake</b> effects are unique because the blades will go through their own <b>wake</b> region during the operation. The presented thesis aims to bridge this knowledge gap by modelling the VAWT <b>wake</b> effects using CFD. As for the general wind turbine <b>wake</b> effects study, four key aspects can be identified: <b>wake</b> models, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and structural integrity. Relevant literature is reviewed in the thesis, and a comprehensive framework of studying the VAWT <b>wake</b> effects is proposed. The framework covers all the four key aspects of the wind turbine <b>wake</b> effects study, and two of them will be addressed in the presented thesis, <b>wake</b> models and <b>wake</b> aerodynamics. CFD modelling in the thesis is based on RANS method. The near <b>wake</b> modelling focuses on the aerodynamics prediction and the far <b>wake</b> modelling focuses on the <b>wake</b> structure prediction. As for the near <b>wake</b> study, <b>wake</b> effects of a circular cylinder at Re= 140000 is studied and validated. the aerodynamic performance of NACA 0015 airfoil at various angle of attack at Re= 2000000 is modelled using different turbulence models, dynamic stall effects of the airfoil at three different regimes are investigated. They form the basis of analysing the aerodynamic performance of VAWT rotor. A 17 m 2 -bladed VAWT designed based on such geometries (circular cylinder and NACA 0015 airfoil) is modelled thereafter, simulated aerodynamic performance under different tip-speed ratios are compared with experiment data. As for the far <b>wake</b> study, both rotor simplification using porous disk and full rotor simulation are presented. A persistent symmetric <b>wake</b> region is observed from the porous disk modelling while the full rotor modelling predicts an asymmetric <b>wake</b> region. The <b>wake</b> interaction is then studied in a two turbine VAWT array, the influence of <b>wake</b> effects on the performance of VAWT at 3 diameters downstream is investigated. Overlapping of <b>wake</b> region is analysed...|$|R
