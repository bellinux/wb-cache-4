25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now {{we are taking}} n balls, one by one, {{in such a way}} that the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way}} that the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, Stewart told Vibe {{that his}} and The-Dream's fellow {{production}} associate Kuk Harrell, would be producing {{a lot of}} the album. He said [...] "I heard him working on some of the vocals and {{she has a lot of}} really good songs, I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> stuff I heard was really good, really strong." [...] Following Lopez's move to Island Def Jam, Lopez re-entered the studio to record new material with Harrell. Lopez later revealed that most of the album had been revamped and most production was now courtesy of Stewart and The-Dream despite recording several new songs with Moroccan producer RedOne, which made the album. Amongst those recorded with RedOne is the Latin music-influenced [...] "On the Floor" [...] which features Pitbull and a sample from Kaoma's 1989 hit single [...] "Lambada". Two other RedOne songs, co-written and co-produced by Lady Gaga, [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] and [...] "Hypnotico", also appear on Love? [...] "Hypnotico" [...] was originally recorded by recording artist Tami Chynn for her unreleased second album. Meanwhile, Lopez told fans in March 2011 that she recorded some of the album's songs in Spanish. Rap-Up revealed that the album was to also feature production from producer Troy [...] "Radio" [...] Johnson.|$|E

50|$|A {{political}} {{movement in the}} United States seeks to define the beginning of human personhood as starting {{from the moment of}} fertilization with <b>the</b> result being <b>that</b> abortion, as well as forms of birth control that act to deprive the human embryo of necessary sustenance in implantation, could become illegal. Supporters of the movement also state that it would have some effect on the practice of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), but would not lead to the practice being outlawed. Jonathan F. <b>Will</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> personhood framework could produce significant restrictions on IVF to <b>the</b> extent <b>that</b> reproductive clinics find it impossible to provide the services.|$|R
2500|$|Leigh's cricketing {{career and}} first class stats might be {{considered}} average {{but he was a}} popular choice as President of the MCC in its first centenary year in 1887 and the Golden Jubilee year of Queen Victoria. At the centenary MCC dinner at the old Tennis Court it was said of him his speech that night rivaled Leighton at the Royal Academy. [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old cricketer stood up bravely in bumpy grounds in spite of awkward knocks and ugly bruises." [...] Wisden acknowledged him as an excellent [...] "long-stop" [...] who [...] "will let a ball go through him rather than by him" [...] and his style of batting was awkward, but he is a fine hitter forward and to leg. It was said of Leigh in his maturer years by one who had played many matches with him when he was captain of I Zingari teams, that {{if ever there was a}} man to pull a match out of the fire by his management, he was that man. The same principle which he carried out on hunting when he came to a big fence, [...] "throw your heart over and the body will follow" [...] was his rule with the bat – he would not be beat.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not want}} to {{compliment}} Admiral Harrington, but as long as such men as he devote their lives to the public service the credit of the country will never cease.

Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) thinks {{they should be}} expelled, but Vocal Adrenaline director Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) disagrees: she decides not to press charges, but she insists they pay for the damages. She then recommends taking {{the money out of}} Glee's budget, but <b>Will</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club <b>will</b> go bankrupt. Finn then <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he and Puck will get jobs, and Shelby agrees. They begin working with Terri at Sheets-N-Things.
