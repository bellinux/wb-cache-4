His first novel, titled Domnișoara din Str. Neptun ("Little Miss on Neptune Street"), saw print in 1921, and marked Aderca's definitive break with traditionalism. It was followed by a long line of other novels and novellas: Țapul ("The Goat", 1921), later reissued as Mireasa multiplă ("The Multiple Bride") and as Zeul iubirii ("The God of Love"); Moartea unei republici roșii ("The Death of a Red Republic", 1924); Omul descompus ("The Decomposed Man", 1926); Femeia cu carne albă ("The <b>White-fleshed</b> Woman", 1927). A member of the Romanian Writers' Society, Aderca also made his debut as a translator from French, publishing a version of Henri Barbusse's Hell (1921). In 1922, he reissued Naționalism? Libertatea de a ucide as Personalitatea. Drepturile ei în artă și în viață ("The Personality. Its Rights on Art and Life", dedicated to philosopher and Noua Revistă Română founder Constantin Rădulescu-Motru), and put out the first section of a more theoretical writing, Idei și oameni ("Ideas and People").|$|E

40|$|Introduction – Treatments with 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), an {{inhibitor}} of ethylene perception, {{were investigated}} on <b>white-flesh</b> loquat fruit {{to extend its}} shelf life and to prevent chilling injury. Ma- terials and methods – The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) <b>white-flesh</b> fruits (cv. Claudia) were submitted to applications of 1 -MCP at 1 °C for 20 h and at concentrations from 1 to 5 μL L. The treated fruits were stored at 1 °C for 21 days before removal to 20 °C for ripening (shelf life). Fruit quality was analyzed at harvest, {{at the end of}} each storage period (7, 14, 21 days at 1 °C). Results and discussion - The 1 -MCP treatment slowed fruit softening depending on concentration, and extended the period before the fruit became over-soft. The untreated fruits exhibited severe chilling symptoms manifested as flesh leatheriness and internal browning after 21 days of storage at 1 °C. The treatment with 1 μL L- 1 1 -MCP significantly inhibited increases in fruit firmness and internal browning in- dex and maintained fruit weight during cold storage and shelf life, thereby delaying the development of chilling injury and maintaining fruit quality.

Hereto, the alcohol insoluble residues were extracted and sequentially fractionated using hot water, a chelating agent, sodium carbonate, and potassium hydroxide solutions to obtain different pectin fractions and a hemicellulose fraction. Chemical analyses were used to characterize these polysaccharide fractions. The results show that cell wall polysaccharides of the pulp and especially of the peel from <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh dragon fruits contain significant amounts of pectic substances that are lowly methyl-esterified. The cell wall polysaccharides of the peel {{as well as those}} of the pulp contain high amounts (38 - 47 %) of loosely bound (water-soluble) pectic substances. In the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of the peel samples, uronic acids are the predominant monomers.

60|$|In {{the second}} chapter on Selection I have given several cases proving that with {{animals and plants}} {{differences}} in colour are correlated with constitutional differences, as shown by greater or less immunity from certain diseases, from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals, from scorching by the sun, and from the action of certain poisons. When all the individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this nature, {{we do not know}} that it stands in any sort of correlation with their colour; but when several similarly coloured varieties of the same species are thus characterised, whilst other coloured varieties are not thus favoured, we must believe in the existence of a correlation of this kind. Thus, in the United States purple- fruited plums of many kinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or yellow-fruited varieties. On the other hand, yellow-fleshed peaches of various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the <b>white-fleshed</b> varieties. In the Mauritius red sugar-canes are much less affected by a particular disease than the white canes. White onions and verbenas are the most liable to mildew; and in Spain the green-fruited grapes suffered from the vine-disease more than other coloured varieties. Dark-coloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by the sun than varieties of other colours. Red wheats are believed to be hardier than white; and red-flowered hyacinths were more injured during one particular winter in Holland than other coloured varieties. With animals, white terriers suffer most from the distemper, white chickens from a parasitic worm in their tracheae, white pigs from scorching by the sun, and white cattle from flies; but the caterpillars of the silk-moth which yield white cocoons suffered in France less from the deadly parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk.|$|E
6000|$|The {{correlation}} {{of a white}} colour and blue eyes in male cats with deafness, and of the tortoise-shell marking with the female sex of the same animal, are two well-known but most extraordinary cases. Equally remarkable is the fact, communicated to Darwin by Mr. Tegetmeier, that white, yellow, pale blue, or dun pigeons, of all breeds, have the young birds born naked, while in all other colours they are well covered with down. Here we have {{a case in which}} colour seems of more physiological importance than all the varied structural differences between the varieties and breeds of pigeons. In Virginia there is a plant called the paint-root (Lachnanthes tinctoria), which, when eaten by pigs, colours their bones pink, and causes the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; so that black pigs only can be kept in the district.[58] Buckwheat in flower is also said to be injurious to white pigs but not to black. In the Tarentino, black sheep are not injured by eating the Hypericum crispum--a species of St. John's-wort--which kills white sheep. White terriers suffer most from distemper; white chickens from the gapes. White-haired horses or cattle are subject to cutaneous diseases from which the dark coloured are free; while, both in Thuringia and the West Indies, it has been noticed that white or pale coloured cattle are much more troubled by flies than are those which are brown or black. The same law even extends to insects, for it is found that silkworms which produce white cocoons resist the fungus disease much better than do those which produce yellow cocoons.[59] Among plants, we have in North America green and yellow-fruited plums not affected by a disease that attacked the purple-fruited varieties. Yellow-fleshed peaches suffer more from disease than <b>white-fleshed</b> kinds. In Mauritius, white sugar-canes were attacked by a disease from which the red canes were free. White onions and verbenas are most liable to mildew; and red-flowered hyacinths were more injured by the cold during a severe winter in Holland than any other kinds.[60] ...|$|E

40|$|Dragon fruit (Hylocereus spp.), {{also known}} as pitaya or pitahaya, is {{increasingly}} gaining interest in many countries, including Thailand which is {{a country with a}} climate ideal for breeding different varieties of tropical and subtropical fruits in general, and dragon fruit more specifically. The benefits of dragon fruit for human health can be explained by its essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, dietary fibres and antioxidants. Dragon fruit is also an essential source of betacyanin which serves as a red/purple pigment with antioxidative properties. In Thailand, most of the fresh dragon fruits are consumed domestically, while some are traded globally as fresh fruit and processed products as juice or puree. As it is, dragon fruit peel and seeds are often considered as waste or by-products from fruit processing and have been less successful at adding value to the fruit. Currently, there is limited literature on dragon fruit properties, its processed products and constituents as well as potential utilization. Therefore, the main objective of this doctoral research was to gain deeper insight in the characteristics of dragon fruit and its derived products and components, specifically of two species of dragon fruit, i. e. <b>white-flesh</b> dragon fruit (H. undatus) and red-flesh dragon fruit (H. polyrhizus). The characteristics of these two species of dragon fruit and their possible application are extensively discussed in the doctoral thesis/research. Chapter 1 provides a state-of-the-art of current and relevant research on dragon fruit with respect to botanical classification, cultivation, economic aspects and chemical composition (particularly nutrients, pigment and antioxidative components) as well as an overview of techniques to process fruits (processing), i. e. freeze-drying and thermal processing. The impact of these processes on quality attributes (e. g. physicochemical and rheological properties) of different fruits is critically reviewed. The review also aims at giving a summarized overview of the most important aspects of seed oil (e. g. chemical composition and lipid oxidation) and cell wall polysaccharides (e. g. structure of pectic and hemicellulosic substances). In Chapter 2, the properties/characteristics of the whole fruit, peel, pulp (seed-free flesh) and puree (flesh containing seeds) of the two species of dragon fruit were performed. Results demonstrated that the peel of both dragon fruit species as well as the pulp and puree of the red-flesh species contained large amounts of betacyanin. As it is, they have the potential to be utilized as a natural colouring agent. Dragon fruit pulp and puree also exhibited significant antioxidative activities. This was even more pronounced for the red-flesh species due to the presence of betacyanin. The pulp and puree showed shear-thinning behaviour due to the presence of mucilaginous components. Throughout this doctoral research, these characteristics of dragon fruit, for example, pigment, antioxidative activities and rheological properties, provide a deeper insight with regard to further valorization of the fruit components and optimization of the fruit processing. Chapter 3 describes the characterization of the freeze-dried pulp and peel of the two species of dragon fruit to be further utilized of dragon fruit’s pigment (betacyanin) as a food additive. It was found that freeze-drying could satisfactorily preserve colour and pigment concentration. The freeze-dried red-flesh pulp and the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel from both species contained high contents of betacyanin. The freeze-dried dragon fruit pulp was well-soluble in water, whereas {{this was not the case}} for the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel. Additionally, due to the pH-sensitivity of betacyanin, the influence of pH (1 - 11) on the colour shift of the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel and pulp was monitored. The colour of the freeze-dried peel was stable within a pH range of 3 - 7, whereas the freeze-dried red-flesh pulp had high colour stability over a pH range of 1 - 11 and is available in a convenient form making it suitable for the use as a food colourant. In order to gain insight into the effects of thermal treatment on the characteristics of the <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh dragon fruit purees, the antioxidative, rheological, physicochemical and microbiological properties of the purees were investigated at different process conditions (between 50 and 90 °C for 60 min). The results are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. It is interesting to see that the antioxidative properties of the heated dragon fruit puree increased during heating treatment probably because of the superior antioxidative attributes of the dragon fruit seeds present in the puree and the formation of Maillard reaction products. During thermal processing, the L* value (lightness) and b* value (yellowness) of the processed dragon fruit puree can be used to control the quality online. Total colour change (TCC), which is an indicator of different colour between the unheated and heated puree samples, of the red-flesh dragon fruit puree showed a strong negative correlation with betacyanin content. The kinetics of colour changes and betacyanin degradation in the heated dragon fruit puree followed a second-order models. The apparent viscosity of the heated dragon fruit puree increased with heating time and temperature. The rheological data fitted very well with the power-law model, showing shear-thinning behaviour. Thus, the heated dragon fruit puree, particularly the red-flesh puree, offer possibilities to be applied in foodstuffs due to their interesting attributes after thermal treatment. The dragon fruit seeds are considered to have a high antioxidative potential. As it is, oil was extracted from the <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh dragon fruit seeds with petroleum ether as cold extraction. The characterization of the seed oil is described in Chapter 5. Dragon fruit seeds contained significant amounts of oil, which accounted for about 32 - 34 % of the dried seed weight. The predominant fatty acids of both dragon fruit seed oils were linoleic acid (C 18 : 2, 45 - 55 %), oleic acid (C 18 : 1, 19 - 24 %), palmitic acid (C 16 : 0, 15 - 18 %) and stearic acid (C 18 : 0, 7 - 8 %), respectively. Dragon fruit seed oil is interesting from a nutritional point of view as it contains a high amount of essential fatty acids, amounting to 56 %. The triacylglycerol (TAG) composition in the seed oil was also analyzed. It was shown to contain mainly triunsaturated and diunsaturated TAGs. A significant amount of tocopherols in the dragon fruit seed oil was clearly observed in which α-tocopherol was the most abundant tocopherol in the oil (72 % of total tocopherol content). In addition, a storage assessment of 3 months was performed, monitoring the oxidative and tocopherol stabilities in the dragon fruit seed oil. A low oxidation rate of both dragon fruit seed oils was obtained, while tocopherol content decreased on storage. However, the concentration of tocopherols in the dragon fruit seed oil after 12 weeks remained high content compared to the initial state. Thus, the dragon fruit seed oil could be considered as a good source of essential fatty acids and tocopherols, with a high oxidative stability. In Chapter 6, the activity of pectic enzymes, i. e. pectin methylesterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG), of the pulp and peel of <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh dragon fruits as well as inactivation of pectic enzymes by thermal treatments (30 - 90 °C for 10 min) were examined. The untreated <b>white-flesh</b> dragon fruit had a higher PME activity compared to the red-flesh dragon fruit, whereas PG activity was absent in all dragon fruit samples. Results also demonstrated that no significant effects of PME activity at temperature below 70 °C for 10 min in either the pulp or the peel of dragon fruit were observed, while a moderate heat treatment (80 and 90 °C for 10 min) could efficiently inactivate PME. In the last part of this doctoral study, the polysaccharides (pectic and hemicellulosic substances) from cell wall materials of the pulp and peel of <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh dragon fruits were isolated and structurally compared, as described in Chapter 7. Prior to cell wall polysaccharide isolation, blanching at 80 °C for 10 min allowed PME inactivation. Subsequently, cell wall material was extracted and sequentially fractionated using various solutions to obtain three different pectic fractions, a hemicellulosic fraction and a remaining residue fraction which could not be solubilized by the procedure used. These polysaccharide fractions were chemically characterized in terms of galacturonic acid (GalA) content, degree of methoxylation (DM), neutral sugar composition, molar mass distribution and affinity towards some specific anti-pectin antibodies. Results showed that the cell wall polysaccharides in the pulp and, to an even greater extent, in the peel of both <b>white-flesh</b> and red-flesh species contained significant amounts of pectic substances. The pectic substances in the dragon fruit peel as well as in the dragon fruit pulp were shown to be lowly methyl-esterified pectin (DM < 39 %) and highly water-soluble pectin (38 - 47 %). A higher contribution of pectic homogalacturonan (HG) region in the peel samples was observed compared to the pulp samples, whereas there were no large differences between the pectic substances of both dragon fruit species. Despite the low average DM value of the pulp and peel pectins, pectic substances in both pulp and peel samples showed an affinity for anti-HG antibodies with different specificities, indicating that a wide range of epitopes (including long blocks of unesterified GalA residues as well as a few consecutive esterified GalA residues) was present. In this doctoral research, the key findings of the experimental work are clearly shown and summarized in Chapter 8. Dragon fruit is an excellent source of bioactive compounds such as betacyanin and tocopherol which both have high antioxidative properties and health-promoting functions. Dragon fruit also provides many valuable products and components that could have high potential of being applied in food industry. For example, the freeze-dried dragon fruit pulp could be used as a red/purple colouring agent (betacyanin) as well as an instant juice powder. The heated dragon fruit puree with significant antioxidative activity could serve as a semi-processed product, the dragon fruit seed oil, on the other hand, was defined as a high-value oil. The extracted cell wall polysaccharide from dragon fruit peel demonstrated to be a low methyl-esterified pectin. Thus, the dissemination of the research findings may significantly increase the value of dragon fruit, resulting in an increased revenue for growers and producers...|$|R
40|$|Oil was {{extracted}} from the seed of <b>white-flesh</b> (Hylocereus undatus; WFSO) and red-flesh (Hylocereus polyrhizus; RFSO) dragon fruits using a cold extraction process with petroleum ether. The delta-, gamma-, and alpha-tocopherol content, fatty acid and triacylglycerol composition, thermal and rheological properties of the extracted dragon fruit seed oils were analysed. The {{results showed that the}} dragon fruit seeds contained a high amount of oil up to 34. 13 %. The principal tocopherol in WFSO and RFSO was alpha-tocopherol. The total tocopherols content of RFSO was 1. 6 times higher than that of WFSO. The three main fatty acids in these oils were palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2). The seed oil is interesting from a nutritional point of view: the essential fatty acid content of WFSO and RFSO counts up to 55. 64 % and 45. 37 % respectively. The main triacylglycerol in WFSO and RFSO was LLL, LLO, PLL, LOO and PLO. The thermal curves for WFSO and RFSO consisted of two main endothermic peaks with a broader temperature range around these peaks of - 49. 58 and 3. 41 °C. The apparent viscosity of WFSO and RFSO was similar (14. 24 - 14. 32 mPa. s). Thus the dragon fruit seed oils can be considered as a new source of tocopherols and essential fatty acids...|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} fish used vary: carp, cod, hake, mackerel, salmon, skate, trout, turbot, perch, haddock, and {{swordfish}} are all possibilities. Some prefer a firm, <b>white-fleshed</b> fish, such as grouper, snapper, or rockfish, and avoid more oily fish.|$|E
50|$|Salmon {{flesh is}} {{generally}} orange to red, although <b>white-fleshed</b> wild salmon with white-black skin colour occurs. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh. Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish.|$|E

40|$|Freeze-drying {{has been}} {{proposed}} to preserve nutritional values and colour of foodstuff. Moreover, few studies disrobe the influence of freeze-drying on the quality characteristic of tropical fruit, like dragon fruit. In this work, freeze-drying characteristics, vitamin C, betacyanins content, L*, a* and b* colour parameters and state diagram of pulp and peel of <b>white-flesh</b> (Hylocereus undatus) and red-flesh (Hylocereus polyrhizus) dragon fruits were investigated after freeze-drying. The effect of pH level on the colour was monitored due to the pH sensitivity of the red pigment, betacyanins present in dragon fruit. The results show that dragon fruit can be successfully freeze-dried. For nutritional point of view, the retention of vitamin C was high and count up to 71. 13 % after freeze-drying. Freeze-dried pulp and peel of red-flesh dragon fruit were a potential source of betacyanins particularly the peel. The water solubility of freeze-dried pulp of both dragon fruit types was up to 7 times {{higher than that of}} the peel. The visual colour of reconstituted sample unchanged at their natural pH and shows only a small changes between pH 3 and pH 7. All cases of freeze-dried dragon fruits obtained low glass transition temperature that varied between - 6. 70 and 4. 83 °C. However, it can be considered that the freeze-dried dragon fruits can probably be applied for food processing...|$|R
40|$|To {{comply with}} the {{relevant}} legal requirements and correct labelling, {{it is necessary for}} business operators and inspection authorities to know the natural characteristics of the raw material. This study gives a comprehensive overview of muscle flesh composition of farmed and wild Atlantic turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and of farmed pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The proximate composition, di- and triphosphates and citric acid values are presented in order to evaluate possible indicators for a hidden treatment during processing to fillets. All moisture contents were ≤ 80 %. Even for pangasius, protein values for deep skinned fillets of ≥ 18 % were determined. Only small quantities of naturally occurring citric acid (up to 0. 03 g·kg− 1) were detectable. The lipid content was the most varying main component within the different species, ranging between 1. 2 % to 2. 0 % and 0. 3 % to 3. 0 % for farmed turbot and barramundi, respectively. Pangasius flesh had a mean lipid content of 7. 8 %. Trimming and separation of the red layer reduced the lipid content of the commercially sold <b>white-flesh</b> fillets to 2. 7 % to 3. 5 %. Fatty acids profiles, free amino acids, and minerals were analysed to show the nutritional quality of the aquaculture fish species and compared to wild turbot and barramundi. Despite some natural variation, these components can be considered as comparable...|$|R
40|$|Background: Yam (Dioscorea alata L.) is an {{important}} tuber crop and purple pigmented elite cultivar has recently become popular because of associated health benefits. Identifying candidate genes responsible for flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (FBP) will facilitate understanding the molecular mechanism of controlling pigment formation in yam tubers. Here, we used Illumina sequencing to characterize the transcriptome of tubers from elite purple-flesh cultivar (DP) and conventional <b>white-flesh</b> cultivar (DW) of yam. In this process, we also designed high quality molecular markers to assist molecular breeding for tuber trait improvement. Results: A total of 125, 123 unigenes were identified from the DP and DW cDNA libraries, of which about 49. 5 % (60, 020 unigenes) were annotated by BLASTX analysis using the publicly available protein database. These unigenes were further annotated functionally and subject to biochemical pathway analysis. 511 genes were identified {{to be more than}} 2 -fold (FDR < 0. 05) differentially expressed between the two yam cultivars, of which 288 genes were up-regulated and 223 genes were down-regulated in the DP tubers. Transcriptome analysis detected 61 unigenes encoding multiple well-known enzymes in the FBP. Furthermore, the unigenes encoding chalcone isomerase (CHS), flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (F 3 H), flavonoid 3 &# 039;-monooxygenase (F 3 &# 039;H), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and flavonol 3 -O-glucosyltransferase (UF 3 GT) were found to be significantly up-regulated in the DP, implying that these genes were potentially associated with tuber color formation in this elite cultivar. The expression of these genes was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Finally, 11, 793 SSRs were successfully identified with these unigenes and 6, 082 SSR markers were developed using Primer 3...|$|R
