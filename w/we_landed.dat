500|$|The {{recording}} engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, [...] remembered the sessions in 2009: [...] "A cloud came along, {{and it was}} called the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and <b>we</b> <b>landed</b> when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when <b>we</b> <b>landed</b> we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macmillan {{threatened}} to resign if force {{was not used}} against Nasser. He was heavily involved in the secret planning of the invasion with France and Israel. It was he who first suggested collusion with Israel. On 5 August 1956 Macmillan met Churchill at Chartwell, {{and told him that}} the government's plan for simply regaining control of the canal was not enough and suggested involving Israel, recording in his diary for that day: [...] "Surely, if <b>we</b> <b>landed</b> we must seek out the Egyptian forces; destroy them; and bring down Nasser's government. Churchill seemed to agree with all this." [...] Macmillan knew President Eisenhower well, but misjudged his strong opposition to a military solution. Macmillan met Eisenhower privately on 25 September 1956 and convinced himself that the US would not oppose the invasion, despite the misgivings of the British Ambassador, Sir Roger Makins, who was also present. Macmillan failed to heed a warning from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that whatever the British government did should wait until after the US presidential election on 6 November, and failed to report Dulles' remarks to Eden.|$|E

60|$|Our crew worked willingly and well, so that ere night {{closed in}} upon us {{we were a}} {{considerable}} distance away from the village.
