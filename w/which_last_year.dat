2500|$|In 2012, {{industrial}} conglomerate China Wanxiang Holdings {{signed a}} $1.25 billion deal with American company GreatPoint Energy {{to build a}} large-scale plant using GreatPoint's catalytic hydromethanation process of coal gasification. [...] The technology converts coal into natural gas and enables the recovery of contaminants in coal, petroleum coke and biomass as useful byproducts. Most importantly, {{nearly all of the}} CO2 produced in the process is captured as a pure stream suitable for sequestration or enhanced oil recovery. The total project will cost an estimated $20 – 25 billion and will supply a trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This represents a massive leap in the scale of domestic production for China, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> produced only 107 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The deal includes an equity investment of $420 million, the largest ever by a Chinese corporation into a venture-capital-funded U.S. company, according to industry tracker VentureSource.|$|E

Kafirs in hundreds were beginning to discard their dirty karosses, and to buy blankets, handkerchiefs, flannels, baize, cotton, knives, axes, and what not, while the traders had set up their stores everywhere in Kafirland-- to say nothing of your own business, Jack, in the gum, ivory, and shooting way, and our profits thereon. We were beginning to flourish so well, too, as a colony. I believe that we've been absorbing annually somewhere about 150,000 pounds worth of British manufactured articles-- not to mention other things, and now--Oh, Jack, mankind is a monstrous idiot!" ...|$|E

60|$|Sir, I believe I am {{not going}} too far when I {{say that this is}} almost, if not quite, the first {{occasion}} upon which what is called the British democracy in its full strength has been brought directly {{face to face with the}} difficulties of Indian Government in all their intricacies, all their complexities, all their subtleties, and above all in their enormous magnitude. Last year when I had the honour of addressing the House on the Indian Budget, I observed, as many have done before me, that it is one of the most difficult experiments ever tried in human history, whether you can carry on, what you will have to try to carry on in India--personal government along with free speech and free right of public meeting. This <b>which</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> was partially a speculative question, has this year become more or less actual, and that is a question which I shall by and by have to submit to the House. I want to set out the case as frankly as I possibly can. I want, if I may say so without presumption, to take the House into full confidence so far--and let nobody quarrel with this provision--as public interests allow. I will beg the House to remember that we do not only hear one another; we are ourselves this afternoon overheard. Words that may be spoken here, are overheard in the whole kingdom. They are overheard thousands of miles away by a vast and complex community. They are overheard by others who are doing the service and work of the Crown in India. By those, too, who take part in the immense work of commercial and non-official life in India. We are overheard by great Indian princes who are outside British India. We are overheard by the dim masses of Indians whom, in spite of all, we shall persist in regarding as our friends. We are overheard by those whom, I am afraid, we must reluctantly call our enemies. This is the reason why everybody who speaks to-day, certainly including myself, must use language that is well advised, language of reserve, and, as I say again, the fruit of comprehensive consideration.|$|E

The FT wrote in part:The data underpinning Professor Piketty’s 577-page tome, which has dominated best-seller lists in recent weeks, contain a series of errors that skew his findings. The FT found mistakes and unexplained entries in his spreadsheets, similar to those <b>which</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> undermined the work on public debt and growth of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.The central theme of Prof Piketty’s work is that wealth inequalities are heading back up to levels last seen before the World War I. The investigation undercuts this claim, indicating {{there is little evidence}} in Prof Piketty’s original sources to bear out the thesis that an increasing share of total wealth is held by the richest few.|$|E

5000|$|Sometime before 1431 the Abbess and Convent {{received}} permission by {{letters patent}} from King Henry VI (1422-1461), {{the son of}} the founder and who was particularly favourable to Syon, having made it several grants and confirmations in rapid succession, to move the monastery to a new site of their own choosing some mile and a half downstream to a riverbank site within Isleworth parish. The land in question had been in the monastery's ownership since 1422, in <b>which</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of the life of Henry V that king had by Act of Parliament separated the manor of Isleworth from the Duchy of Cornwall and given it to Syon. The reason for the move was to gain more space, as is made clear from the letters patent:“The said Abbess and Convent had presented their humble petition setting forth that their aforesaid monastery was so small and confined in its dimensions that the numerous persons therein ... were not only incommodiously but dangerously situated...that in consequence thereof the said abbess and convent had chosen out a spot in the neighbourhood of their said priory within the said lordship of Isleworth, more meet healthful and salubrious for them to inhabit”.The danger of the situation referred to may have been due to proximity to the river, or possibly even spiritual danger to the inmates due to a too close intermingling of the sexes.|$|E
