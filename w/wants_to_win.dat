2500|$|There is a Christian element {{present in}} Sonnet 144. Shakespeare {{refers to the}} man and woman as angels. Helen Vendler {{believes}} that the boy represents salvations while the woman is sin. [...] "Q1 offers the familiar Christian model of the better angel and the worser spirit, both prompting the speaking, but transforms these spirits into loves, and gives them names deriving from theology: comfort (salvation) and despair (the unforgivable sin). The iconographic description fair/ colored ill [...] supports the Christian model of angel and devil." [...] The bad angel comes between the poet and the good angel. [...] "Q2 while beginning with the Christian presumption that the bad angel <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> [...] soon to hell, slides away from the motive in lines 7-8, as a witty new version of the old plot emerges; the bad angel loses interest in the speaker, and turns her interest to the better spirit." [...] Sonnet 144 reflects Shakespeare's relationships with young boy and the dark lady through the use of Christian images.|$|E
