5|$|Monroe {{was next}} to star in a {{television}} adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's short story Rain for NBC, but the project fell through as the network did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> her choice of director, Lee Strasberg. Instead of working, she spent {{the first six months}} of 1961 preoccupied by health problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a cholecystectomy, and spent four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a mental ward – for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In Washington, D.C., Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge {{helped him}} obtain {{part-time}} {{work in the}} army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals. He would write of this experience in [...] "The Great Army of the Sick", published in a New York newspaper in 1863 and, 12years later, in a book called Memoranda During the War. He then contacted Emerson, this time {{to ask for help}} in obtaining a government post. Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> the author of such a disreputable book as Leaves of Grass.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Hooper, Spielberg {{initially}} wanted Jon Voight. Timothy Bottoms, Joel Grey, and Jeff Bridges were also considered for the part. Spielberg's friend George Lucas suggested Richard Dreyfuss, whom he had directed in American Graffiti. The actor initially passed, but changed his decision after he attended a pre-release screening of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing {{that no one would}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> him once Kravitz was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in Jaws. Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley's novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it. As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor, as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as his [...] "alter ego".|$|E

500|$|GLaDOS {{returns from}} Portal {{as a major}} {{character}} and the game's antagonist, and is voiced by Ellen McLain. The writers found that they needed another character to play off Johnson, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> another voice actor. Having already recruited McLain to play GLaDOS, they asked her to provide the voice for Caroline, Cave Johnson's assistant. Wheatley is voiced by Stephen Merchant; early demonstrations at trade shows used the voice of Valve animator Richard Lord. The writers wrote Wheatley's lines with Merchant in mind, citing his unique [...] "vocal silhouette" [...] {{and his ability to}} ad lib in a [...] "frantic" [...] manner. They had assumed that Merchant would be unavailable and contacted The IT Crowds writer Graham Linehan to try to get Richard Ayoade, but then discovered that Merchant was interested. Merchant spent around sixteen hours recording lines and was given freedom to improvise.|$|E
2500|$|When Gleason {{moved to}} CBS, Kelton was left behind; her {{name had been}} {{published}} in Red Channels, a book that listed and described reputed communists (and communist sympathizers) in television and radio, and the network did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> her. Gleason reluctantly let her leave the cast, with a cover story for the media that she had [...] "heart trouble". At first he turned down Meadows as Kelton's replacement. Meadows wrote in her memoir that she slipped back to audition again and frumped herself up to convince Gleason that she could handle {{the role of a}} frustrated (but loving) working-class wife. Rounding out the cast, Joyce Randolph played Trixie, Ed Norton's wife. Elaine Stritch had played the role as a tall and attractive blonde in the first sketch, but was quickly replaced by Randolph. Comedy writer Leonard Stern always felt The Honeymooners was more than sketch material and persuaded Gleason to make it into a full hour-long episode.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unsolicited}} screenplay {{was written}} by two novice writers, actor Gregory Fleeman and documentarian Robert T. Megginson. Producer Jack Wiener read their script, which was submitted as a low-budget television movie, and felt {{that it should be}} made into a theatrical release. Wiener and his co-producer Dodi Fayed hired Robert Mandel, an Off-Broadway director. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> an action director, but instead wanted a director who would bring a realistic touch to the film and make the audience care about the main character. Mandel accepted the job because he wanted to dispel the perception that he was a [...] "soft, arty director". Initially he was not impressed with the film's screenplay, which he felt was not well-crafted but felt that it provided for [...] "a lot of action and a lot of things I did not have under my belt". In preparation for the film's action sequences, Mandel studied chase scenes from Bullitt and The French Connection. To pull off the film's special effects, the producers hired John Stears, who had worked on the first eight James Bond films and shared a special effects Academy Award for [...]|$|E

You will probably get one for a few shillings. Get one with a sail as well as oars. Go out the first thing after breakfast, and go up or down the river as the tide or wind may suit. Take some bread and meat with you, and don't return till supper-time. Then you can spend your evenings with Shakespeare. Maybe I myself will come down and take a sail with you sometimes. That will bring the colour back into your cheeks, and make a new man of you. Would that I had thought of it before!" ...|$|E

So she threw up the whole business of regular army nursing, and made up her mind to go out into the field of duty to which she had appointed herself, and do the things she ought to do in the way she thought they ought to be done.
