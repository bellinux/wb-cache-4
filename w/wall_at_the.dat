5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the line. The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been {{investigated}} in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> south end of the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E

5|$|The main {{building}} material is Kentish rag-stone, although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide {{details in the}} Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17thand 18thcenturies. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18thcentury, only two original– albeit restored– examples remain, in the south <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gallery level.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Doukas, {{on the morning}} of 29 May 1453, the small postern called Kerkoporta was left open by accident, allowing the first fifty or so Ottoman troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the Inner Wall and opened fire on the Greek defenders of the peribolos below. This spread panic, beginning the rout of the defenders and leading to the fall of the city. In 1864, the remains of a postern located on the Outer <b>Wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, were discovered and identified with the Kerkoporta by the Greek scholar A.G. Paspates. Later historians, like van Millingen and Steven Runciman have accepted this theory as well. However, excavations at the site have uncovered no evidence of a corresponding gate in the Inner Wall (now vanished) in that area, {{and it may be that}} Doukas' story is either invention or derived from an earlier legend concerning the Xylokerkos Gate, which several earlier scholars also equated with the Kerkoporta.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, it was {{reported}} that the stone was unearthed during the installation of electrical road (likely for a tram) and restored to its original location by the Woonsocket chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Sometime later, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque on the stone, but it was absent {{at the time of its}} nomination in 1982. The marker is currently mortared into a retaining <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the sidewalk on 640 South Main Street at the intersection and has been since prior to 1982. As of 2013, a Daughters of the American Revolution plaque is present.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet {{to take the time}} to dig in {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a kill zone over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, {{and his face was}} smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The 1761 Milestone is a {{milestone}} on 640 South Main Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The stone originally marked {{the junction of}} a Colonial highway from Great Road and an east-west route from Boston, Massachusetts, {{to the state of}} Connecticut. The stone was rediscovered during the installation of an electrical road (likely a tram). In 1898, the stone was reportedly restored to its original location by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The stone is embedded in a low retaining <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner of South Main Street and Smithfield Road. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1982, and is historically significant as Colonial-era highway marker.|$|E

5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E
5|$|Four laps later, Gordon passed Johnson {{to become}} the leader. On lap 218, the seventh caution was given after Logano's engine failed. Most of the front-runners made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 225 restart, Gordon was the leader, ahead of Kyle Busch, Harvick, and Stewart, while Johnson {{restarted}} in ninth, after having an 18-second pit stop. By lap 236, Johnson had moved up to the fifth position. Four laps later, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made pit stops because of a loose wheel. By lap 244, Gordon had a 1.1 second lead over Kyle Busch. Gordon continued to increase his lead over the second position, while Martin passed Menard for the 11th position. On the following lap, Stewart moved into the third position. By the 277th lap, Gordon had a 1.8 second lead over Kyle Busch in second. On lap 282, Kyle Busch made a pit stops, one lap before Gordon, Stewart, and Harvick made pit stops. On lap 284, Johnson made a pit stop, as the eighth caution was given after Andy Lally collided with the <b>wall.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> lap 290 restart, Stewart was the leader, ahead of Kyle Busch, Gordon, and Johnson.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At {{the south end of the}} Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow his car to be removed from the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E
5|$|John died in 1216 and was {{succeeded by}} his nine-year-old son, Henry, {{with the support}} of the barons. With no {{prospect}} of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the damage incurred during John's siege, the castle was in dire need of repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around £680 were spent on repairs, of which £530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of £300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain <b>wall.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, buttery, and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid to making the castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, £132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over £120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than £120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to HenryIII's worsening relations with his barons.|$|E
5|$|On lap 272, Martin {{reclaimed}} {{the lead}} {{as the previous}} leaders had made their pit stops. Four laps later, the eighth caution was given because of debris on the track in turns three and four. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, although Martin stayed out and remained the leader on the restart. After the restart, the ninth caution was given after Reutimann and Earnhardt made contact, causing Earnhardt to collide with the turn two <b>wall.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> lap 287 restart, Martin remained the leader ahead of Kurt Busch. One lap later, Montoya moved up into third after passing Hamlin and Johnson. On lap 289, Montoya passed Kurt Busch at the first turn for the second position. One lap later, Kurt Busch lost a further position when he was passed by Hamlin. On lap 292, Martin had a 1.1-second lead. Two laps later, the tenth caution came out after Allmendinger spun in turn two after he made contact with Marcos Ambrose. Martin led on the restart, followed by Montoya and Hamlin. On the final lap, Allmendinger spun sideways, bringing out the eleventh and final caution, and the field was frozen, with the finishing order determined by where the drivers were running {{at the moment of}} caution. The result gave Martin the victory, which was his fifth win of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kyle Busch in fifth. Kurt Busch, Newman, Sadler, Biffle and Bowyer rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
