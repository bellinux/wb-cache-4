5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

Coins struck in high relief often have {{problems}} with details not coming up sharp enough and dies having a shorter than usual lifespan. If the design {{is higher than the}} rim, the coin may not be stackable, and the highest points of the design will <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> very quickly.|$|E
25|$|The second general {{characteristic}} of Pachypodium is spinescence, or having spines. The spines come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. Spines emerge with leaves, and like leaves grow {{for a short}} period before stopping growth and hardening. Spines do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion can <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> all but the youngest spines from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.|$|E
25|$|Some animals develop {{only one}} set of teeth (monophyodont) while others develop many sets (polyphyodont). Sharks, for example, grow {{a new set of}} teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth. Rodent incisors grow and <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> {{continually}} through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length. The industry of the beaver {{is due in part to}} this qualification. Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as leporidae like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors.|$|E

25|$|Abrasion is the {{property}} of the coal which describes its propensity and ability to <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> machinery and undergo autonomous grinding. While carbonaceous matter in coal is relatively soft, quartz and other mineral constituents in coal are quite abrasive. This is tested in a calibrated mill, containing four blades of known mass. The coal is agitated in the mill for 12,000 revolutions at a rate of 1,500 revolutions per minute.(I.E 1500 revolution for 8 min.) The abrasion index is determined by measuring the loss of mass of the four metal blades.|$|E

25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.|$|E
25|$|The player must {{assure the}} {{survival}} of the Traveller, as many planets have dangerous atmospheres such as extreme temperatures, toxic gases, and dangerous storms. Though the player can seek shelter at alien bases or underground caves, these environments will <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> at the exosuit's shielding and armour and can kill the Traveller, thus the player must collect resources necessary for survival. By collecting blueprints, the player can use resources to craft upgrades to their exosuit, multitool, and spacecraft to make survival easier, with several of these upgrades working in synergistic manners to improve the survivability and capabilities of the Traveller. Each of these elements have a limited number of slots for both upgrades and resource space, requiring the player to manage their inventories and feature sets, though the player can either gain new slots for the exosuit or purchase new ships and multitools with more slots. Many features of the exosuit, multitool, and spacecraft need to be refuelled after prolonged use, using collected resources as a fuel source. Better equipment, and the blueprints and resources to craft that equipment, are generally located closer to the centre of the galaxy, providing a driver for the player.|$|E
500|$|Shen and {{the other}} {{characters}} were mostly well received. Cooper applauded the conflicted nature of Shen's personality {{as a result of}} being in an overwhelming situation, arguing that this detail solidified him as a developed and likeable protagonist. Cooper found the Triad members unsatisfactory by comparison, comparing them unfavorably with Grand Theft Auto characters. Edge called Shen an engaging protagonist and also complimented the other characters, whose voice actors brought life to the characters. Blyth described the cast, aside from Shen, as [...] "brilliantly recognizable stereotypes that have been given enough extra edge for you to care about them", and felt the attitude shifts of some characters were distracting and unrealistic. Wilson said that the characters were [...] "fleshed out brilliantly". Pinsof claimed that the game's premise [...] "grants a perfect excuse for Shen to do terrible things while remaining a sympathetic, level-headed lead." [...] Kelly thought Shen's two-faced nature was the main entertainment factor of the missions. Whitehead found the player's ability to switch allegiances as needed to <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> at [...] "the already fragile grasp the narrative has on Shen's conflicted loyalties." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of how to render the stars (representing the 13 original states) on the coin was posed in the letters; in the end, Leech opted for six-pointed stars on the obverse and five-pointed ones on the reverse. Barber had prepared three versions of the design, each with clouds over the eagle; Leech approved one on October 31 and ordered working dies prepared, but then began to question the presence of the clouds, and had two more versions made. On November 6, President Harrison and his Cabinet considered which of the designs to approve, and chose one without the clouds; the following day, Leech ordered working dies prepared. Barber scaled down his design for the quarter and dime. While the Cabinet approved the designs, members requested that the Mint embolden the words [...] "Liberty" [...] on the obverse and [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] on the reverse, believing that these legends would <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> in circulation; despite the resulting changes, this proved to be accurate. For the reverse of the dime, on which, by law, an eagle could not appear, a slight modification of the reverse of the Seated Liberty dime was used, with a wreath of foliage and produce surrounding the words [...] "One Dime".|$|E

2500|$|Other {{structures}} {{within the}} joint {{can also be}} affected. The ligaments within the joint become thickened and fibrotic and the menisci can become damaged and <b>wear</b> <b>away.</b> Menisci can be completely absent {{by the time a}} person undergoes a joint replacement. New bone outgrowths, called [...] "spurs" [...] or osteophytes, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces {{in the absence of the}} menisci. The subchondral bone volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypomineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The pain in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened synovium and subchondral bone lesions.|$|E

2500|$|During the Crisis of the Third Century, {{constant}} wars {{required a}} lot of coins to be produced, leading to heavy debasing of precious metal coinage. The antoninianus was eventually debased {{to the point where}} flans (blank metal disks) were produced with 5% silver or less, and pickled to dissolve the copper from the surface producing a spongy surface of almost pure silver. When these coins struck, the force of striking would produce a thin shiny layer of silver on the surface, which would quickly <b>wear</b> <b>away.</b> These [...] "silvered" [...] coins are not considered fourrées, since they are not actually plated since the metal is actually a continuous layer and these coins were not created to deceive.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbits {{and other}} {{lagomorphs}} usually shed their deciduous teeth before (or very shortly after) their birth, {{and are usually}} born with their permanent teeth. [...] The teeth of rabbits complement their diet, which consists {{of a wide range}} of vegetation. Since many of the foods are abrasive enough to cause attrition, rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life. [...] Rabbits have a total of 6 incisors, three upper premolars, three upper molars, two lower premolars, and two lower molars on each side. There are no canines. Three to four millimeters of the tooth is worn away by incisors every week, whereas the posterior teeth require a month to <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> the same amount.|$|E
2500|$|The dog is a {{spring-loaded}} arm pivoted on {{the outside}} of the lock plate. A sparking material, usually a small piece of iron pyrite, is clamped and held by vice-like jaws at the swinging end of the arm. The dog has two possible positions to which it can be pivoted by hand: a [...] "safe" [...] position, in which the dog is pushed towards the muzzle of the firearm, and an [...] "operating" [...] position, where the dog is pulled towards the operator so that the pyrite in its jaws can engage either the top of the pan cover (see below), or (in the absence of the pan cover) the edge of a steel wheel bearing longitudinal grooves around its circumference. Flint is not suitable as a sparking material in the wheellock because it is too hard and would quickly <b>wear</b> <b>away</b> the wheel grooves.|$|E
