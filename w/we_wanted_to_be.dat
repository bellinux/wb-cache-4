In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E

Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY.

500|$|All Hands on the Bad One is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed fourth album The Hot Rock, released in 1999. The Hot Rock marked a considerable {{change in the}} band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. It {{was also the first}} Sleater-Kinney album that entered the US Billboard Top 200 chart, peaking at number 181. Some fans, however, dismissed the album, claiming that the band had sold out and that it was a commercial album. This criticism was something that singer and guitarist Corin Tucker strongly disagreed with, claiming that The Hot Rock was their least commercial album due to its longer and intricate pieces. According to Tucker, [...] "we wanted to be doing difficult work. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expanding as musicians and people didn't want that from us.

I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the pilot episode, Weiner studied American culture during the 1950s and 1960s, {{analyzing}} literary {{works such as}} The Feminine Mystique (1963) and Sex and the Single Girl (1962) while viewing such films as The Apartment (1960) and A Guide for the Married Man (1967). He continued his endeavors when the series' concept began to materialize, as he received a copy of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road (1962) from the executives of AMC. Weiner discussed the look of Mad Men with production designer Bob Shaw and cinematographer Phil Abraham, whom Weiner had previously collaborated with in The Sopranos. Abraham wanted to establish a more genuine approach to portraying society in the 1960s, rather than [...] "simply referencing the period as seen in movies of that time. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more genuine than that. Movies were an influence." [...] In evoking historical accuracy of elements such as architecture and graphic design, Abraham sought inspiration from the buildings designed by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. [...] He said, [...] "We noticed that in all the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designs of contemporary buildings, the ceiling—the overhead grid of lights—was a strong graphic element in all the office spaces. In one design we loved, the whole ceiling was like a lightbox. It {{was a time of}} high modernism, and we embraced the notion of presenting the world in that way. These were new work spaces—sleek, not stuffy." ...|$|E

Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films.

500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said {{one of the reasons they}} decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E
