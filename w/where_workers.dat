All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, a 3-hour {{power outage}} caused by testing of new {{distribution}} circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II. These included the Grumman plant in Bethpage and the Republic Aviation plant in Farmingdale, <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> staged an impromptu baseball game {{while they waited}} for power to return. Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power. Although sabotage was not suspected, it caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request that the Army guard the power station.|$|E
5|$|Mill {{workers in}} England became {{increasingly}} disenchanted with improper practices by factory owners, long working hours and unsatisfactory conditions. During the early 1850s workers {{throughout the country}} began to campaign for higher wages and strikes were held in several towns and cities; brickmakers in Manchester struck in January while woollen mill operatives in the West Riding of Yorkshire went on strike two months later. Grimshaw himself {{was involved in a}} strike in Stockport, <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> were demanding a ten percent wage increase, in March 1853.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} impact of unionization on two farms in Ethiopia with {{different}} incentive schemes. Under relative incentives, <b>where</b> <b>worker</b> effort imposes a negative externality on co-workers, the average union member’s productivity is 10 percent lower at the intensive margin than the average non-union member’s. Under piece rates, <b>where</b> <b>worker</b> effort imposes no externality, the union has no effect at the intensive margin. I argue the result under relative incentives is due to union workers internalizing the externality more than non-union workers. This is especially apparent when there are more union members in a working group on a given day, which rules out pure altruism as {{the driving force of}} worker behavior. Further, I find that group output variance is lower for higher levels of union member concentration, which suggests collusion...|$|R

Holden's town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville <b>where</b> <b>workers</b> could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.|$|E
