5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Varro, {{in command}} {{on the first}} day, is {{presented}} by contemporary sources {{as a man of}} reckless nature and hubris, who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, a small portion of Hannibal's forces ambushed them. Varro repelled the attack and continued on his way to Cannae. This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the Aufidus River, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side. The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.|$|E

25|$|Iconodules further {{argued that}} {{decisions}} {{such as whether}} icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved {{the issue of the}} proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck {{also worked}} to {{maintain}} the friendship of Russia and a working relationship with Napoleon III's France, the latter being anathema to his conservative friends, the Gerlachs, but necessary both to threaten Austria and to prevent France allying itself to Russia. In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds. This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became Germany's permanent enemy, and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{appreciated}} that constant patrols by destroyers was both wasteful {{of time and}} resources of those ships, and left them open to attack. Instead, they designed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships approaching and freed up the destroyers for duties escorting larger ships. In the future, ships were never to be sent out one by one. The British realised it <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to have sent Arethusa into battle with inadequate training and jammed guns. British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect: this criticism later proved counter-productive when at the Battle of Dogger Bank, ships became excessively cautious of wasting ammunition and thus missed opportunities to damage enemy vessels.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the success}} that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still {{struggling}} to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two. He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, <b>was</b> <b>foolish.</b> In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E
25|$|The enemy, Brinkmann thought, {{could and}} would glean {{important}} intelligence {{from the most}} seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to St. Nazaire and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention {{of the extent of}} the damage incurred by Bismarck was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue Lütjens with any orders since they had no information {{on the state of the}} task force.|$|E
25|$|No {{written orders}} had been issued to Paget. It had been agreed that {{officers}} domiciled in Ulster {{would be allowed}} to “disappear” {{for the duration of the}} crisis, with no blot on their career records, but that other officers who objected were to be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign. Although the ODBN concurs that Seely <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> in effectively giving any officers discretion over which orders to obey, he was keen to keep Paget on the government's side and maintain the unity of the Army. The move to deploy troops resulted in the Curragh incident of 20 March, in which Gough and many other officers threatened to resign. The elderly Field-Marshal Roberts, whom Seely had told the King was “at the bottom” of the matter, thought Seely “drunk with power”.|$|E

25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|Jarett Wieselman from New York Post {{tried to}} {{understand}} what actually went wrong with the production, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the mutual disagreements between Gaga and Kahn led to the video being a [...] "piece of rubbish".

[...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video, calling the song [...] "over-the-top" [...] with a [...] "lackluster" [...] and [...] "understated" [...] video. Doses Leah Collins was more neutral in her review, questioning if Gaga was simply [...] "swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown-stone steps" [...] or just attempting to [...] "be saving a metric buttload on the budget".

500|$|The battle {{culminated in}} the early evening hours with a Prussian cavalry charge, led by von Seydlitz, upon the Russian center and {{artillery}} positions, a futile effort. The Prussian cavalry suffered heavy losses from cannon fire and retreated in complete disorder. Seydlitz himself was badly wounded and, in his absence, Generalleutnant Dubislav Friedrich von Platen assumed command. Under Frederick's orders, Platen organized a last-ditch effort. His scouts had discovered a crossing past the chain of ponds south of Kunersdorf, but it lay {{in full view of the}} artillery batteries on the Grosser Spitzberge. Seydlitz, still following the action, noted that it <b>was</b> <b>foolish</b> to charge a fortified position with cavalry. His assessment was correct, but Frederick had apparently lost his ability to think objectively. [...] The strength of Frederick's cavalry lay in its ability to attack at a full gallop, with riders knee to knee and horses touching at the shoulders. The units sent against the position shattered; they had to attack piecemeal because of the manner in which the ground was naturally formed. Before any further action could take place, Laudon himself led the Austrian cavalry's counter-attack around the obstacles and routed Platen's cavalry. The fleeing men and horses trampled their own infantry around the base of the Mühlberge. General panic ensued.|$|E
