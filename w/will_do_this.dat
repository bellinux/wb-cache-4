5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|Mating {{behaviour}} {{is similar}} to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this {{does not seem to}} benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again. Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> 3 to 5 times in one season.|$|E

500|$|Encounters between workers {{last for}} 15 seconds. Ritualised {{fighting}} only occurs with two worker ants who {{come into contact}} with each other, but if both ants are from the same colony, they break contact and groom themselves. Afterwards they walk around until they make contact with another ant. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation (the act of touching with the antennae) and gaping of the mandibles, and stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in a display of size-matching. Workers perform a behaviour known as [...] "front leg boxing"; both workers have their front legs sweeping up and down, where it would flex at the coxal joint in a paddling motion. This paddling motion is aimed at each other during the fight, going on for three to five seconds on average. From this point on, this would determine who is a [...] "loser" [...] and who is the [...] "winner".|$|E

[...] Grey's Anatomy is about Meredith's journey. Men and romantic interests {{are a part of}} her life, but they are not the priority. She doesn't need McDreamy. Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and I believe that this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E
500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors {{what they think of}} the new doctrine. Edwin's priest Coifi responds that they may be worthwhile; after all, he says, no one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fatalism is {{normally}} distinguished from [...] "determinism", {{as a form}} of teleological determinism. Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future. Fate has arbitrary power, and need not follow any causal or otherwise deterministic laws. Types of fatalism include hard theological determinism and the idea of predestination, where there is a God who determines all that humans <b>will</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> may be accomplished either by knowing their actions in advance, via some form of omniscience or by decreeing their actions in advance.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{within the}} body of a loop there is a desire to skip the {{remainder}} of the loop body and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

2500|$|All hamsters are {{excellent}} diggers, constructing burrows {{with one or}} more entrances, with galleries connected to chambers for nesting, food storage, and other activities. They use their fore- and hindlegs, as well as their snouts and teeth, for digging. In the wild, the burrow buffers extreme ambient temperatures, offers relatively stable climatic conditions, and protects against predators. Syrian hamsters dig their burrows generally at a depth of 0.7 m. [...] A burrow includes a steep entrance pipe (4–5cm in diameter), a nesting and a hoarding chamber and a blind-ending branch for urination. Laboratory hamsters have not lost their ability to dig burrows; in fact, they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with great vigor and skill if they are provided with the appropriate substrate.|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{the meaning}} of Laius's oracle, the one {{delivered}} to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given our modern conception of fate and fatalism, readers of the play {{have a tendency to}} view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay [...] "On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex", E.R. Dodds draws a comparison with Jesus's prophecy at the Last Supper that Peter would deny him three times. Jesus knows that Peter <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being forced to deny Christ. Free will and predestination are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition {{go on and on}} testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is the first thing the simulation <b>will</b> <b>do?</b> <b>This</b> simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This [...] "K-aka-H" [...] either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new [...] "K-aka-H" [...] until it arrives at its 12th figure.|$|E
