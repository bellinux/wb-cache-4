40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} fertilization on the abundance of species with different clonal growth characteristics using the data from a 20 -year fertilization experiment from the Laelatu <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow,</b> in Estonia. The experiment comprised four different fertilization treatments and created a gradient of nitrogen availability. The vegetation composition was recorded every year by measuring the proportions of aboveground biomass for all species. For each species, four parameters of vegetative propagation were measured: speed of ramet vegetative mobility (annual increment of rhizome length), frequency of rhizome branching, placement of branches, and ramet life span. The weighted average of each parameter was calculated for each plot both {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the experiment using the relative abundances of the species in the plot as weights. The community changes resulting from the fertilization are reflected in the significant changes of the average values of all studied clonal growth parameters. Increased levels of phosphorus and potassium led to a community with an increased average vegetative mobility and rhizome branching. Both of these traits, however, declined with the increasing availability of nitrogen. The proportion of species with long-living ramets in the community decreased with the increase in the productivity irrespective of the fertilizer used. There was a strong positive correlation between the average ramet life span of the community and the number of species on the plot. We concluded that fertilization increased the ramet turnover rate in this meadow community and reduced species richness. Thus, our results contradict the prediction of a higher ramet turnover rate in species-rich compared to the species-poor grasslands...|$|E

This study has examined literature and performed interview studies about how the tree biology is affected by various cutting techniques. This study has focus on aspects that are believed to affect the tree's health in the long run, examples of such aspects is: choice of tools, accuracy at cutting positions and removal of branch-stubs. The study concluded that there are many other aspects that may be even more important for the tree's health than just the methods of how to remove branches. Age, lopping cycle and size of the cut surfaces considered to be very important aspects. Since the method for cutting branches does not play a decisive role for the tree's health, the choice of technique should be based on other aspects. Therefore, the purpose of the tree and the environment in which it must fit is important and should be considered when choosing tools and cutting techniques. This may be more important than choosing only one method that’s always used, just because it might be considered best for the tree. Therefore, in a historical environment as a <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow</b> there might be reasonable to break off branches, while in parks where aesthetics is more important the saw may be preferred.

We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep, After abandonment 87 % of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1 / 3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of wooded meadows cannot rely on the soil seed bank. Endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep was shown for 15 % of the species with seed densities per 100 g air dried dung of 737 and 767. respectively.

40|$|The Swedish {{countryside}} at {{the beginning}} of the nineteenth century was still so varied and rich that there was room for both human beings and animals almost everywhere. It is true that for thousands of years man had struggled with the advancing forests. First the primaeval deciduous forest was cleared during the warm period following the last glaciation, and after the great climatic change at the close of the Swedish Bronze Age (ca 700 B. C.) the struggle was against the encroaching spruce on practically all fronts. The struggle resulted in culture steppes, pine heaths, birch groves and <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> All these types of landscape were gradually filled with the fauna adapted to them. Different types of cultivation have alternated, and as the nature has changed, the fauna has adapted itself.

In addition to vegetation relevés, light intensity (PAR) was also measured in plots. Within the still-managed RWM, two floristically distinct types were recognized using TWINSPAN analysis: meadow-like and forest-like. Light intensity differed significantly between types. The CCA of active RWM showed a significant relation between species composition and light conditions. The number of species per relevé on active RWM was negatively correlated with light intensity - in contrast to North European wooded grasslands. This {{could be explained by}} the influence of species-rich riparian hornbeam forests that contribute many understorey species, in contrast to naturally mesotrophic meadows. CCA of both active and abandoned RWM demonstrated that light was a good predictor of RWM species composition and that abandonment caused profound changes in floristic composition. The species turnover during succession was more pronounced in less shaded meadow-like RWM where more light-requiring (grassland) species occurred. Species richness was the highest in active forest-like RWM. There {{were no significant differences in}} species richness between active meadow-like RWM and groups of abandoned RWM.

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{traditional}} usage of hazel in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> {{in the island}} of Gotland, and the relations between this usage and the biodiversity of these lands. Research on relations between historical land-use and biodiversity {{is a relatively new}} field and there is presently no such undertaken research on traditional usage of hazel. The aim of the study is to explore how the usage of hazel in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> in Gotland where undertaken under the period between 1647 to 1925 and its connections to biodiversity. As indicators for biodiversity, the essay focuses on two endangered species of long-horned beetles that are dependent of dead hazel wood for their reproduction cycle. As relating theories, the essay looks upon the subject through the two concepts of biocultural heritage and intangible cultural heritage. The methods used are literature and archive studies, complemented by interviews with craftsmen with particular knowledge of traditional handicrafts of common hazel usages in Gotland. The study shows that the most common method of harvesting hazel in the meadows has been a type of selective cutting, in favor of coppicing a whole bush at a time. Selective cutting has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes which created sparse hazel bushes of an approximate height of 3 meters, containing dead wood of hazel of various sizes and height. As such, the traditional usage has been mostly beneficial for the two long-horned beetles. The essay concludes that modern methods of environmental management should copy the traditional method of selective cutting, with the exception that more dead wood should be created in order to create enough living space for the two long-horned beetles. Furthermore, this type of integrated management will also probably benefit other types of beetles, some types of stingers as well as valuable vascular plants in the field level.

After one season of exposition,the baits were collected enclosed in fly-wire cages, where emerging insects were collected for two seasons. This thesis consists of two parts: The first part is an unpublished manuscript dealing with effect of habitat insolation, vertical stratification, forest structure and amount of dead wood on community of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and jewell beetles (Buprestidae) feeding on wood of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Baits were exposed in the canopy and the understorey of forest interior, the canopy and the understorey of forest edge and on solitary trees on <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Most insect species do prefer insoled wood for their development, and were {{more common in the}} understorey than in the canopy. Insolation of bait was thus the prime factor affecting composition of reared insects. No relation was found between dead wood volume and species composition or abundance of reared insects This shows that insolation of the dead wood is crucial to conservation of most xylophagous insects. The second part of the thesis studies effect of vertical stratification and insolation on distribution of xylophages feeding reared from wood of 8 tree species (Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, P. x canadensis, Salix alba, Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus laevis) and host specificity of xylophages. Results show that: (i) community composition of xylophages reflects evolutionary history of their host plants; (ii) communities reared from different trees exhibit different preferences for forest strata and insolation of the habitat, probably in connection to preferred growth conditions of the host plant, (iii) many xylophagous insect species exhibit strong preferences to insoled habitats, and are thus confined to forest edges in extensively managed forests as well as in unmanaged forest reserves...|$|R
