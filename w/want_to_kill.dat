25|$|The {{purpose and}} {{benefit of the}} paralysing toxin is not clear. Being arachnids, ticks are related to predatory {{arthropods}} (spiders, scorpions and mites). Spiders and scorpions have retained toxins and developed specialised delivery structures (fangs and telsons) while mites and ticks have lost this feature. Of the 800 species of ticks, 40-64 species (across 10 genera) have been reported as causing a form of toxosis. So as ticks have moved from a predatory existence to a parasitic existence, most species have lost their toxin {{which would have been}} a disadvantage for a parasitic lifestyle (parasites in general do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> their host). Gene sequence of the tick toxin shows high homology to scorpion toxins.|$|E

25|$|To hear Edward's voice, Bella {{attempts}} cliff-diving {{and nearly}} drowns, {{but she is}} saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because he thought it would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family should vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E
25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E

25|$|In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa {{appears at}} Rama's {{doorstep}} and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands {{an audience with}} Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, {{decided it would be}} better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Rama was overcome with sorrow, for he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world through Yoga.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher R. M. Hare told a parable {{in an attempt}} to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a [...] "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people– religious and non-religious– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by empirical evidence. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world. Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.|$|E
