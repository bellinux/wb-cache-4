5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b>|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected <b>with</b> <b>HIV,</b> they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected <b>with</b> <b>HIV,</b> households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> develop the active disease.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those <b>with</b> <b>HIV,</b> {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E

It has been well described that individuals <b>with</b> primary <b>HIV</b> infection have an increase in activated CD 8 + T cells, which causes a state of immune activation as was evident in this patient. Acquisition of HCV during this time could have further skewed this response resulting in massive hepatocyte destruction, inflammation, and subsequent liver fibrosis. Recent literature suggest that MSM <b>with</b> primary <b>HIV</b> infection have higher rates of acquisition of HCV than other HIV-positive cohorts and HCV acquisition can occur very soon after acquiring HIV.

In these studies, alcoholics exhibited enlarged, cerebrospinal fluidfilled spaces (i. e., ventricles) as well as tissue shrinkage in various brain regions (e. g., the corpus callosum and frontal cortex), whereas study participants <b>with</b> asymptomatic <b>HIV</b> infection showed few abnormalities.

Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> infection).|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{recommendations}} for children are somewhat {{different from those}} for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults.

5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b>|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{comprehend}} {{the characteristics of}} patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1 ＋ 2) antibodies in the preliminary screening so as to provide basis for local HIV screening and prevention. Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum HIV (1 ＋ 2) antibodies in the preliminary screening, after which the positive serum was sent to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) confirmatory laboratory to be confirmed with western blotting method. Clinical data of patients <b>with</b> positive <b>HIV</b> antibodies in the preliminary screening in the outpatients and inpatients from 2006 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 394 patients <b>with</b> positive serum <b>HIV</b> antibodies were screened initially, in which 214 were confirmed positive HIV, 13 were not certain and another 167 were negative. Patients <b>with</b> positive serum <b>HIV</b> antibodies in the preliminary screening were increased from 9 cases in 2006 to 94 cases in 2013, in which those confirmed <b>with</b> positive <b>HIV</b> increased from 5 to 49. Patients <b>with</b> positive serum <b>HIV</b> antibodies in the preliminary screening and those confirmed increased annually. In addition, patients confirmed <b>with</b> positive serum <b>HIV</b> antibodies were mainly males and aged 20 ～ 49 years, distributing in Departments of Infections, Respiratory, Dermatology, Hematology and Emergency, whereas those confirmed <b>with</b> negative <b>HIV</b> were mainly females and aged ＞ 20 years, distributing in Departments of Hematology, Maternity and Emergency as well as Reproductive Center. Conclusion: HIV infection is in low level with characteristics of annually increasing infection rate, male-orientated and wide-spread distribution in variuos departments, etc., knowing which will help guide the clinical practices and carry out the local HIV screening and prevention by relevant departments...|$|R
