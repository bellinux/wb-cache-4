5000|$|The U.S. Congress, on February 9, 1870, {{authorized}} [...] "... meteorological observations at {{the military}} stations {{in the interior of}} the continent and at other points in the states and territories of the United States, and for giving notice on the northern lakes and seaboard by telegraph and signals of the approach and force of storms". This duty, previously conducted by the Smithsonian Institution, was assigned to General Myer's Signal Corps, due in part to his previous interests in storm telegraphy. It was the birth of the U.S. Weather Bureau, now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1873 at the International <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Congress</b> of Vienna, he proposed a resolution for the establishment throughout the world of weather stations and daily exchange of simultaneous weather observations, the effective beginning of the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Organization.|$|R

The same year, when the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Congress</b> was held in Geneva, he was elected as the chairman of the Expert Committee which established the WMO Tropical Cyclone Project, following the UN resolution {{in the wake of the}} 1970 Bhola cyclone which devastated Bangladesh. He was also a member of the WMO Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology (CAeM) and his participation was reported in the preparation of Procedures for Air Navigations Services - Meteorology (PANS-MET). When WMO initited the World Weather Watch program in 1961, he was associated with the initiative and under the aegis of the I.Met.D, he contributed to the program by establishing a Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) and a Regional Telecommunication Hub (RTH) in New Delhi. He was also credited with re-designing the structure of I.Met.D on a regional basis.|$|E
40|$|There {{is now an}} {{unprecedented}} demand for authoritative information on past, present and future state of the world’s snow and ice resources. The cryosphere, which includes solid precipitation, snow cover, sea ice, lake and river ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground, exists in various forms at all latitudes and in about one hundred countries. It {{is one of the}} most useful indicators of climate change, yet {{is one of the most}} under-sampled domain in the climate system. The International Polar Year (IPY) helped demonstrate the urgent need for a sustained, robust, end-to-end cryosphere observing and monitoring system not only for polar regions, but globally. The Sixteenth <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Congress</b> (Geneva, 2011) decided to embark on the development of a Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) as an IPY legacy with a view of an operational GCW. GCW is now being implemented for sustained cryosphere observing, monitoring and provision of data and information. GCW will provide service-oriented information for informed decision-making and policy development related to climate, water and weather. It will ensure a comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable system of observations and information that will allow for a full understanding o...|$|E
