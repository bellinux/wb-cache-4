5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch <b>while</b> <b>keeping</b> an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica.

On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, <b>while</b> <b>keeping</b> outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E

5|$|In March 1928, Pflueger {{published}} his submission {{for a new}} building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange, featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes.

Pflueger's first response was a sketch with little ornamentation. Construction began in December 1928.

5|$|Instead, Super Mario 64 was {{followed}} by other 3D Mario games on subsequent Nintendo systems, such as Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube and Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii.

Later 3D titles, namely Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, <b>while</b> <b>keeping</b> many of Super Mario 64s core gameplay elements, departed from the game's open-ended design and focused more on platforming reminiscent of 2D titles.
