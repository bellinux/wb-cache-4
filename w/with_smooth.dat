40|$|Tests are {{presented}} of a recently proposed lattice fermion {{action for the}} study of quantum chromodynamics and of two related actions. The proposed action is a clover action <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links and a clover coefficient tuned to optimize chiral properties. The two related actions are a clover fermion action <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links and a tree-level clover coefficient, and a Wilson action <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links. Scaling tests of these actions were made by comparing hadron masses calculated at two lattice spacings that differ by roughly a factor of two. Systematic errors were controlled by holding the lattice volume and source sizes approximately constant in physical units, by holding the quark mass constant in physical units, and by using identical methods to calculate hadron propagators and extract masses for the two lattice spacings. Scaling violations of the rho mass were found to be reduced for this pair of lattice spacings from approximately 7 0. 000000 or the conventional Wilson action. Scaling violations of the rho mass were found to be unchanged between the conventional Wilson action and the Wilson action <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links. Tests of suppression of exceptional configurations on coarse lattices were made for five actions (the proposed action, the two related actions <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links, and the conventional Wilson and clover actions without smoothed gauge links). A modest but significant improvement in the suppression of exceptional configurations was found for all the actions <b>with</b> <b>smoothed</b> gauge links compared with the conventional clover action...|$|R
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader leaves <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers.

5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, <b>with</b> <b>smooth,</b> thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.|$|E

Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets <b>with</b> <b>smooth,</b> fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Agaricus giganteus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, who illustrated {{it in his}} book Coloured Figures of English Fungi. Other historical synonyms include Clitocybe gigantea (Quélet, 1872), Paxillus giganteus (Fries, 1874), and Omphalia geotropa var. gigantea (Quélet, 1886). In 1934, Robert Kühner and Réné Maire created the genus Astropaxillus to contain species of Leucopaxillus <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> spores, and they set L.giganteus as its type species. American mycologist Rolf Singer transferred it to its current genus in 1938, but recognized the value of maintaining a distinction of the smooth-spored species, and so made L.giganteus the type species of section Aspropaxilli.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a light microscope, they are elliptical, <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> walls and {{dimensions}} of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5µm. The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes the pigment to form globules. Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over <b>with</b> <b>smooth</b> metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E

5|$|Global {{announced}} on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, {{a move that}} coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and {{to replace it with}} a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting <b>with</b> <b>Smooth</b> Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime.|$|E

In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, <b>with</b> <b>Smooth,</b> allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E
