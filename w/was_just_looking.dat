500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} Beijing, China on December 10. Filming was {{scheduled}} to wrap a week later on December 17, 2012. The China filming {{did not include the}} main cast and crew. In January 2013, it was reported that a film crew led by Shane Black would begin location scouting in Hyderabad, India and Bengaluru, India between January 20 and 24. Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that reshooting was taking place in Manhattan Beach. Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013 at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character [...] "didn't feel real enough — there wasn't a sense of him being [...] the real world, mostly because he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> down a lens and threatening the world." [...] A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $200 million, with a net of $178.4 million for Iron Man 3 after tax incentives from North Carolina and Florida.|$|E

But I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a bit of cover and as it happened I did stall him and he didn't score that one. I was the player he made a fool of if anybody needs to remember." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to this, NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol grinned [...] "I assume [...] baseball strategy {{has to be}} a big disappointment." [...] Counting the All-Star Game, both League Championship Series and the World Series, CBS would have televised just 38 games. This comes on the account of both League Championship Series and the World Series going to a full seven games. Ebersol criticized Peter Ueberroth for negotiating the four-year, $1.06 billion deal with CBS. According to Ebersol, Ueberroth was totally focused on business. Ebersol said [...] "Ueberroth wanted his legacy to be the maximum amount of money. Baseball got this enormous overbid with CBS, coupled with expanding the cable package (on ESPN) from zero to four nights a week. Now, when they find themselves in trouble, they've got no place to expand. There just wasn't a lot of foresight. (Baseball <b>was)</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for the big score." ...|$|E

On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett {{announced}} that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with CBC News. Hewlett said that from their work on Monkey, [...] "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at when we come to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music". Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: [...] "I'm so f--king bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them". In a later interview Hewlett said: [...] "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way".|$|E
