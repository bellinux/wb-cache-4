5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> through the same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2006 Gator Bowl following a 10–2 regular season that included wins over 15th-ranked Georgia Tech and traditional rivals Virginia. A loss to Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game had given Tech a bid to the Gator Bowl instead of the more prestigious Bowl Championship Series-run Orange Bowl game. Facing the 12th-ranked Hokies were the 15th-ranked Louisville Cardinals, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> 9–2 during their first season in the Big East Conference. Louisville had won its last five games before the Gator Bowl and had participated in the Liberty Bowl during the previous season.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} national championship game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game. Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> 12–0 during the regular season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.|$|E

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, {{he was charged with}} perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to Bradford for the centenary festival {{formed the}} Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but {{works closely with}} it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Van der Byl {{was willing to}} endorse the Smith government's {{negotiations}} with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the short-lived government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> over to support Robert Mugabe. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliament seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 {{at the age of}} 76.|$|E
5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, Michaels and Diesel {{captured}} the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{next day at}} SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel. This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until Survivor Series that November. Michaels {{went on to win}} the Royal Rumble in 1995, which set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> on to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund). As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match and was attacked by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a fan favorite.|$|E
