5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E

25|$|With {{occasional}} exceptions, a male tinamou {{maintains a}} territory and a nesting site during the breeding season which {{a succession of}} females will visit, laying their eggs in the same nest. Females will <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> several territories mating with, and laying eggs in the nests of, the resident males. Nests are always on the ground, concealed in vegetation or among rocks. Eggs are relatively large and glossy, often brightly colored when laid, and are incubated by the males {{for a period of}} 2–3 weeks. The chicks can run soon after hatching and are largely self-sufficient at three weeks old.|$|E

25|$|A boastful donkey {{refuses to}} behave or obey {{the orders of}} its masters. Having {{a mind of its}} own, it leaves {{whatever}} master it has and manages to <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> Judea. Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E
25|$|Noticing {{that all}} sinkholes are connected, {{they come to}} the {{conclusion}} that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E

2500|$|The type of {{trajectory}} may be {{more important}} than one particular trajectory. [...] Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class. [...] Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. Linear dynamical systems and systems that have two numbers describing a state are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} {{for the pilot}} episode [...] "Children of the Gods" [...] in 1997, Will Joyner of The New York Times {{considered}} Stargate SG-1 a [...] "challenging, if derivative, mix" [...] that is [...] "more than a Stargate [...] fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for." [...] He had a mixed opinion about the cast and was disturbed by SG-1 use of visual shock tactics {{to make up for}} its lower television budget. Reviewing the same episode, Variety Tony Scott criticized that [...] "superficial characters <b>wander</b> <b>through</b> their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction" [...] in a show that is [...] "essentially for young people". He mocked that the wooden acting, [...] "pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue [...] and Mario Azzopardi's broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions." [...] Many critics responded negatively to the gratuitous use of sexual implication and female nudity in the pilot episode, which according to Wright had been filmed on Showtime's insistence despite his vocal opposition and was cut from the pilot's 2009 direct-to-DVD version.|$|E
