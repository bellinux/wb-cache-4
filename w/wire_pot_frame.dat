40|$|Effect of a {{microbial}} inoculum (Material A) which contains 5 strains of antagonistic Actinomycetes against Fusarium oxysporum with an organic carrier {{on the control}} of Fusarium diseases was investigated in <b>pot,</b> <b>frame</b> plot and field experiments. Material A suppressed radish yellows in <b>pot</b> and <b>frame</b> experiments using infected field soils and affected the population density of F. oxysporum in radish roots and rhizosphere soils. In the field experiments, radish yellows and Fusarium wilt of strawberry were also suppressed by the application of Material A. The suppressive effect of Material A on Fusarium diseases was more pronounced in stripe application than in broadcasting application. Co-application with chlorpicrine was {{the most effective way}} of using Material A for the control of Fusarium diseases. The control effect of Material A on Fusarium diseases was influenced by the application of a large amount of other organic materials, such as bark compost, cow compost or pig compost. In many cases, Material A was effective in the control of Fusarium diseases such as radish yellows and Fusarium wilt of strawberry. Control of the diseases using this material may be successful when it is combined with the application of other chemicals...|$|R

50|$|Mirrors are {{represented}} in association with fire in two codices of the Borgia Group from central Mexico during the Aztec period (Codex Borgia and Codex Vaticanus B). The mirrors are placed with censers that serve as hearths for the fire goddess Chantico. Another scene from the Codex Borgia depicts a burning Toltec-style mirror used as a hearth for a sizeable pot. The mirror-hearth and <b>pot</b> are <b>framed</b> by four fire serpents. On another page of the same codex, the god of fire Xiuhtecuhtli is making fire from a mirror placed {{on the back of}} a fire serpent. An Aztec sculpture of a seated figure bears a smoking mirror on its back to represent the fifth sun. The iconography of the Aztec sun stone closely conforms to that of Postclassic turquoise mirrors; and is based upon the design of earlier Toltec pyrite mirrors.|$|R

He later created a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and intended to become a dancer, but an ankle tendon injury prevented him pursuing dance as a career. When the drummer in Machito's band was drafted to the army, Puente subsequently took his place.|$|R

40|$|Blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) are an {{economically}} important crab caught in baited traps throughout the Indo-west Pacific and Mediterranean. In Australia they are traditionally caught using rigid wire traps (approximate to pots) {{but there has}} been a recent increase in the use of collapsible pots constructed from polyethylene trawl mesh. Two experiments were conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland, to determine the ghost fishing potential of lost crab pots on both target and bycatch species and to evaluate the differences between traditional and contemporary pot designs. A lost contemporary, collapsible trawl mesh pot will catch between 3 and 223 R pelagicus per year after the bait has been exhausted, while a traditional <b>wire</b> mesh <b>pot</b> would catch 11 - 74 crabs peryear. As most fishers now use the collapsible trawl mesh pots, ghost fishing mortality could be as high as 111, 811 - 670, 866 crabs per year. Bycatch retention was also higher in contemporary designs. Periods of strong winds appeared to increase the ghost fishing potential of lost pots. The use of escape gaps, larger mesh sizes and construction options that allow for the deterioration of entrance funnels to minimise ghost fishing are recommended to reduce environmental impacts...|$|R

His defeat by South African Perrie Mans saw Davis miss a crucial pink from its spot on the verge of pulling up to one frame behind at 15–16. This incident is of great note as his brother Joe was following each ball intently, swaying in his seat and almost falling into the gangway when his brother missed this key <b>pot.</b> After this <b>frame</b> Joe Davis was taken ill; he was rushed to hospital to undergo a six-and-a-half-hour operation, and died a few weeks later. So dramatic was the missed pink that it became known as 'the ball that killed Joe Davis'. Davis closed 1978 with a quarter-final appearance in the United Kingdom Professional Championship. He defeated veteran Yorkshireman John Dunning 9–2 before losing to Alex Higgins 9–4.|$|R
40|$|There is a mutualistic {{symbiotic}} association between legumes and rhizobia, {{which results in}} the formation of nodules (nitroegn fixing sites) on the roots of legumes. In addition to other factors, plant hormones have an important role in developing and establishing nodules. Some plant growth promoting rhizobcteria promote nodulation by lowering endogenous levels of plant hormone ethylene in roots through their l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylate(ACC) -deaminase activity. So co-inoculation of lentil with rhizobia and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) containing ACC-deaminase, might improve nodulation. A series of experiments were conducted under gnotobiotic, <b>wire</b> house (<b>pot)</b> and field conditions to study the effect of co-inoculation on nodulation in lentil. Several strains of rhizobia were isolated from lentil nodules on yeast extract mannitol (YEM) medium and those of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria containing ACC-deaminase on minimal salt medium with ACC as sole nitrogen source. The collected rhizobial strains were screened for their ability to cause nodulation and PGPR strains for their growth promoting activity under gnotobiotic conditions. All possible combinations of the selected rhizobial and PGPR isolates were tested under gnotobiotic conditions for improving nodulation to screen the best combinations. The role of the selected combinations and rhizobial and PGPR strains included in the combinations, was evaluated for improving nodulation and growth of lentil through co-inoculation in pot and field trials. The selected rhizobial as well as plant growth promoting rhizobacterial strains containing ACC deaminase were characterized for plant growth promoting attributes. It was observed that inoculation with rhizobia or PGPR containing ACC-deaminase alone improved nodulation/growth of lentil over control under natural conditions. Moreover, co-inoculation with rhizobia and ACC-deaminase containing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria further improved nodulation and growth of lentil as compared to singl-strain-inoculation. In a classical triple response study, it was also observed that the selected PGPR containing ACC-deaminase diluted the effects of exogenously applied ACC...|$|R
60|$|The mean {{temperature}} of Churra (elev. 4000 feet) is about 66 degrees, or 16 degrees {{below that of}} Calcutta; which, allowing for 22 degrees of northing, gives 1 degree of temperature to every 290 to 300 feet of ascent. In summer the thermometer often rises to 88 degrees and 90 degrees; and in the winter, owing to the intense radiation, hoar-frost is frequent. Such a climate is no less inimical to the cultivation of plants, than is the wretched soil: of this we saw marked instances in the gardens {{of two of the}} resident officers, Lieutenants Raban and Cave, to whom we were indebted for the greatest kindness and hospitality. These gentlemen are indefatigable horticulturists, and took a zealous interest in our pursuits, accompanying us in our excursions, enriching our collections in many ways, and keeping an eye to them and to our plant-driers during our absence from the station. In their gardens the soil had to be brought from a considerable distance, and dressed copiously with vegetable matter. Bamboo clumps were planted for shelter within walls, and native shrubs, rhododendrons, etc., introduced. Many Orchideae throve well on the branches of the stunted trees which they had planted, and some superb kinds of Hedychium in the ground; but a very few English garden plants throve in the flower-beds. Even in <b>pots</b> and <b>frames,</b> geraniums, etc., would rot, from the rarity of sunshine, which is as prejudicial as the damp and exposure. Still many wild shrubs of great interest and beauty flourished, and some European ones succeeded with skill and management; as geraniums, Salvia, Petunia, nasturtium, chrysanthemum, Kennedya rubicunda, Maurandya, and Fuchsia. The daisy seed sent from England as double, came up very poor and single. Dahlias do not thrive, nor double balsams. Now they have erected small but airy green-houses, and sunlight is the only desideratum.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a strong}} amateur career, Bond turned {{professional}} for the 1989-1990 season. He reached his first ranking semi-final {{in his first}} season, and his first final in his second season, but his career peaked in the mid-1990s. In the 1994 World Championships, Bond pulled {{off one of the}} biggest comebacks in the event's history, rallying from 9-2 to defeat Cliff Thorburn 10-9 in what would be Thorburn's final appearance at the Crucible. A year later, Bond reached the final after beating Stephen Lee, Alan McManus, Gary Wilkinson and Andy Hicks, but lost to Stephen Hendry 18-9. This was his only semi-final run of the season. As a consequence of reaching the final, he climbed to number 5 in the world rankings for 1996/97, and in that same season he acquired his only ranking tournament victory (after three previous losing finals), the British Open, beating John Higgins 9-8 after needing a snooker in the final frame, winning the World Snooker Association Performance of the Year award for this achievement, although he has failed to maintain this level of performance.He reached at least the quarter finals at the Crucible Theatre every year from 1993 to 1996, losing to Stephen Hendry every time, which added extra spice to their first round match in 2006. After leading comfortably throughout the match Bond was pegged back to 7-7, and the match went to a final frame. With only the black remaining, and 7 points up, Bond clipped it into the left corner pocket, only for the cue ball to go [...] in the right middle pocket, resulting in a respotted black (the first one ever to decide the final frame of a World Championship match), which Bond <b>potted</b> to take <b>frame</b> and match. Final score 10-9, Bond's first win at the Crucible since 1999, and his only last-16 run of that season.|$|R
40|$|During the Bronze Age the Po valley was {{occupied}} by fortified villages (1650 - 1170 BC) which were linked by a common culture (Terramare). Their society had a complex structure and {{was among the most}} advanced in Europe. The pottery analysis project is oriented to investigate the specialization of the manufacturing process in the frame of the social organization in the Terramare. 180 pots from several sites near Modena (Pontenuovo, Gorzano, Cà dei Monesi, Montebarello and Montale), dated between Middle and Recent Bronze Age, have been analysed. 30 clays and other sediments have been sampled from different local geological units (Cardarelli et al. 2007). Ceramic and sediment samples have been investigated by: granulometry, petrography with digital image process, chemical analysis of major, minor and trace elements (WDS-XRF), X-ray powder diffraction. Some XRPD experiments were performed on raw and physico-chemical treated sediment samples (air dried, glycolated, heated at 375 and 550 °C oriented mounts) to obtain the clay minerals composition. 		 The ceramic paste is coarse, with abundant temper (mainly calcite and grog). The common mineral composition is: quartz, albite, k-feldspar, illite (muscovite). Amphiboles, pyroxene, calcite, rutile, forsterite, hematite are present only in some samples. Chemical compositions of the pottery are quite homogenous. For the sediments the concentration of CaO is an important marker to distinguish the raw materials used for the pottery. The pots are mainly locally made, using different locals raw materials, with some differences in each site and in the selection of temper according to the functions of the <b>pots.</b> In the <b>frame</b> of this research an experimental archaeological activity has been performed in the archaeological park of Montale.
