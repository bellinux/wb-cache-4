40|$|The {{leaves of}} chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) plant {{have been used}} for centuries in Montenegro and other Mediterranean {{countries}} as a vegetable in salads, sauces and other types of appetizers and meals. The <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>chicory</b> leaves from different location in Montenegro were analysed regarding several nutrients, major and trace element and vitamin composition using standard methods of analysis. The results of the study indicated that chicory leaves were rich in total dietary fiber and mineral content and had low energy value. Also, they were potential sources of useful nutrients such as potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, and vitamin A, with the average content of 391. 9, 164. 7, 0. 55, 2. 33 and 0. 47 mg / 100 g in fresh leaves, respectively. Wild plants were superior to the cultivated ones regarding carbohydrate, calcium and manganese content. Origin of the chicory leaves significantly influenced most of the analyzed parameters...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{soils are}} often {{contaminated}} with trace metals and the toxicity of the metals depends, in part, on their speciation in soil solutions. The objectives {{of this project}} were to estimate the metal speciation in urban soils and to evaluate the predictability of soil metal pools on plant uptake. The chemical speciation of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn was estimated by using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM). In soil solutions, Cd, Ni and Zn were present mainly as free ions when the solutions were acidic and their organic complexes were dominant as the pH was over 7. 5. The other two metals mostly formed complexes with organic ligands. The activities of Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 +, Pb 2 + and Zn 2 + were affected by soil pH and total soil metal burdens. All five metals were under-saturated {{with respect to the}} minerals which could potentially control the metal solubility. Metal uptake by plants in the contaminated railway yards was generally not correlated with free, dissolved and total soil metal pools. A pot experiment demonstrated better correlations between the metal pools and the metal content in <b>wild</b> <b>chicory.</b> Multiple regression analysis showed that the metals in the leaves and roots of <b>wild</b> <b>chicory</b> could be adequately predicted by the soil total metals and soil properties such as pH and exchangeable Ca...|$|E
40|$|As soil metal {{contamination}} {{is rapidly}} increasing worldwide, {{mainly because of}} human activities, phytomanagement of polluted land is becoming an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective option that can also produce biomass and energy as secondary utilities. Some Asteraceae and Polygonaceae species growing spontaneously as invasive weeds on natural and farmed land, which are considered medical or edible alimurgic species, have been identified to accumulate high above-ground levels of toxic elements, thanks to efficient root-to-shoot translocation. Most of them combine high adaptability to marginal soils with good shoot biomass, and many are metal indicator or hyperaccumulator species.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A 12 -year-old {{hairy root culture}} of Cichorium intybus L., a callus culture of the plant as well as roots and leaves of a wild plant of chicory, and roots of two C. intybus L. var. sativum cultivars were examined in respect of their hydroxycinnamate and sesquiterpene lactone com-positions and contents. Total phenolics and diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of the examined plant tissues were also analyzed. The most active in radical scavenging were extracts from the hairy roots and leaves of chicory. 3, 5 -Dicaffeoylquinic acid was the major antioxidant present in the hairy roots. Its content in the root biomass reached 5. 5 %, calculated on a dry weight basis. 8 -Deoxylactucin glucoside (crepidiaside A) was the major sesquiterpene lactone in the hairy roots. Its content reached 1. 4 %, calculated on a dry weight basis, and was nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that in the roots of <b>wild</b> <b>chicory</b> plant. The glucosidic derivative of 8 -deoxylactucin constituted over 85 % of the total sesquiterpene lactone content in the long-term cultured hairy roots of chicory. Aglycone of this compoundwas reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of hydroxycinnamates in callus and hairy root cultures of C. intybus were undertaken for the first time...|$|E

40|$|Numerosos trabalhos comprovaram que os carotenóides principais de folhas verdes são invariavelmente luteína, beta-caroteno, violaxantina e neoxantina. No entanto, há discordância em torno dos carotenóides minoritários. Portanto, a espectrometria de massas por impacto de elétrons e cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência com {{detector}} de arranjo de diodos foram utilizados para confirmar a identidade de carotenóides minoritários com atividade provitamínica A em verduras folhosas brasileiras. Os carotenóides pró-vitamínicos A, incluindo os isômeros cis e trans de beta-caroteno, foram separados em coluna de C 18 polimérica, Vydac 201 TP 54, com metanol/água (98 : 2) como fase móvel. Os espectros UV-visível e de massas confirmaram o carotenóide monoidroxilado como sendo alfa-criptoxantina e não beta-criptoxantina como aponta a literatura internacional. Todas as onze folhas analisadas (agrião, alface crespa, alface lisa, almeirão, caruru, chicória, couve, espinafre, rúcula, salsinha e taioba) apresentaram alfa-criptoxantina, 13 -cis-beta-caroteno e 9 -cis-beta-caroteno, enquanto que alfa-caroteno foi encontrado em apenas quatro folhas (caruru, couve, salsinha e taioba). The main carotenoids {{from green}} leafy vegetables have been consistently {{found to be}} lutein, beta-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin. However, there is a controversy about the identity of minor carotenoids.

40|$|In biennal {{and winter}} annual {{ecotypes}} of Arabidopsis thaliana, flowering is typically blocked {{in the first}} growing season. Exposure to prolonged cold temperature, in a process called vernalization, is required to remove this block and permit flowering in the next growing season. In late-flowering ecotypes of Arabidopsis, a flowering repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), is expressed at such high level to inhibit flowering in the first growing season. The delayed flowering is due to dominant alleles of FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLC. FRI elevates expression of FLC to levels that suppress flowering. FLC inhibits the transition to flower by repressing {{the expression of the}} genes named Floral Pathways Integrators (such as LFY, FT and SOC 1). These genes are able to integrate a balance of stimulations originating from the different pathways inducing flowering and convert these inputs into an induction of FMI (Floral Meristem Integrators) genes, thereby initiating the production of the first floral meristems. Vernalization is the main process promoting flowering by the repression of FLC. Therepression involves epigenetically stable modifications in FLC chromatin that include dimethylation of histone H 3 at Lys 9 (H 3 K 9) and Lys 27 (H 3 K 27). Summer-annual accessions of Arabidopsis flower rapidly without vernalization, due to a mutation in an active FRI allele or due to the presence of a weak FLC allele; in both cases the levels of FLC expression is low compared to the wild type. <b>Wild</b> <b>chicory</b> (Chicoryum intibus L.) is a biennial species which requires vernalization to flower. Chicory is economically important for its use as vegetable and as an industrial raw material to obtain inulin from roots. In Italy different types of chicory (the so called italian red and variegate types) have been selected by farmers. These types show quite different classes of precocity in relation to flowering. We are investigating the molecular mechanism that regulate the switch to flower in chicory, to verify whether such mechanism is the same that controls flowering in Arabidopsis, and finally, address the diversity of the classes of precocity to one of the cases known for this model plant. A cDNA sequences with high homology to AtFLC was identified and a detailed expression analysis was carried out in chicory plants. Transgenic arabidopsis and chicory plants will be produced to functionally characterize this gene...|$|E
