50|$|Trees in this wood include oak, ash {{and field}} maple, {{together}} with some elms, although many {{were killed by}} Dutch elm disease. Invertebrates include the rare <b>white-spotted</b> <b>pinion</b> moth, which depends on elms for food for its larvae, and white-letter hairstreak butterflies. The dead elms provide a habitat {{for a wide variety}} of fungi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>White-spotted</b> <b>Pinion</b> (Cosmia diffinis) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} in central and {{southern}} Europe, north it is found up to central England and the southern parts of The Netherlands. There is a disjunct population in Gotland. South, it is found up to Spain, Italy, Russia, northern Greece and Bulgaria. East, it is found up to Lithuania and the Black Sea.|$|E
50|$|It occurs {{sporadically}} throughout Britain, {{mainly in}} broad-leaved or mixed woodland habitats, {{but also in}} hedgerows. The key habitat requirement {{is the presence of}} wych elm. Other macro-moths in the ‘elm-feeding group’ (i.e. moths whose caterpillars only feed on elm, as opposed to species which include elm in their diet alongside other trees) are the clouded magpie, the dusky-lemon sallow, and the lesser-spotted and <b>white-spotted</b> <b>pinions</b> - but whereas all of these species can feed on other species of elm (and some prefer other elms in fact), Blomer’s rivulet appears to feed on wych elm only.|$|R
