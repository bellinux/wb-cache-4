25|$|Persons {{who keep}} their own surname after {{marriage}} {{do so for}} a number of reasons. Objection to the inequality of the tradition is one major reason. Some people are the last ones in the family with that surname. Others don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the paperwork. Common reasons for maintaining their birth name include not wanting to lose their identity, preferring their last name to their spouse's last name, and fear of professional ramifications.|$|E
500|$|Kneale also adapted Sharpe's Gold for ITV in 1995, as part {{of their}} series of adaptations of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels. This was an {{assignment}} that surprised his agent; [...] "We didn't think he'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with them but he did. That was probably because he liked the producer." [...] He returned to writing for radio {{for the first time since}} the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary The Quatermass Memoirs for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three Quatermass serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV Quatermass serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of Quatermass and the Pit, as the Professor.|$|E
2500|$|In nine {{passages}} of the Masoretic Text are found signs usually called inverted nuns, because they resemble the Hebrew letter nun(נ) written in some inverted fashion. [...] The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed editions. [...] In many manuscripts, a reversed nun is found—referred to as a nun hafucha by the masoretes. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown {{as the standard}} nun upside down or rotated, because the printer did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> to design a character to be used only nine times. [...] The recent scholarly editions of the Masoretic Text show the reversed nun as described by the masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as simaniyot (markers).|$|E

5000|$|Bruce {{carried the}} name over due <b>to</b> not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with}} a brand new name, so he stuck with the old one however insists that despite having the same name it is not the same band. When asked why he chose that {{particular}} name, he explained that [...] "Most bands have a pretty shit band name, so I just came up with something. I came up with Alexandria as a human name, because people relate to humans." [...] although the reason for using the word asking is not explained.|$|R
60|$|The {{effect of}} the new vigor in the police {{department}} was felt in many other ways. There was a tenement-house law regarding buildings which were unfit for human habitations. New York City was crowded with such buildings, but nobody had ordered them torn down, because either nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother,</b> or the owners paid blackmail money to keep them standing for the rent they could get out of them.|$|R
2500|$|Wright had a {{reputation}} of a liberal russophile. He translated works by Leo Tolstoy, and wrote that Tolstoy's greatness [...] "has been obscured from us rather than enhanced by his duality: a realist who strove to demolish the mysticism of Christianity and became himself a mystic in the contemplation of Nature." [...] In 1908 Wright personally presented Tolstoy a letter signed by more than 700 English admirers. Wright noted Tolstoy's [...] "apparent serenity" [...] but did not mention his aversion to public events. Tolstoy lamented in his diary: [...] "At this advanced age, when {{there is nothing left}} to think about but death, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> me with that!". Later, Wright provided legal support to Tolstoy's secretary Vladimir Chertkov and his family after their emigration to England.|$|E

5000|$|Witch Hunt was {{reviewed}} by Jon Sutherland in issue 61 of White Dwarf magazine (January 1985), rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Sutherland concludes the review by saying: [...] "Witch Hunt is interesting {{in a limited}} way, in fact 'limited' is a good word to sum the game up. There are precious few innovations in evidence and I couldn't imagine players <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> playing it more than once or twice. It is neither 'realistic' nor comprehensive enough to merit recommendation." ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{why women}} delay seeking {{treatment}} for symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarc-tion (MI) remains an enigma.

5000|$|The {{total number}} of {{offences}} in 2012 was the lowest since 1989, and gave the lowest crime rate per head of population since before electronic records were maintained. Police said the largest decrease was in Canterbury, where recorded crime fell by over 11% - due to a large decrease in recorded theft and property damage offences immediately after the Christchurch earthquakes. However, this doesnt necessarily mean crime actually dropped. Deputy Police Commissioner Viv Rickard said [...] "This decrease appears to be {{partly due to the}} public not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> us with minor matters when they knew we were dealing with the earthquake.|$|R
