Gideon's father enters the room and tells him that he should be celebrating Gideonland, instead of reading the book. Gideon tells his father the true nature of this book; the story reads that it was written a long time ago by a brilliant unknown author who learned the secrets of Gravity Falls, secrets too powerful for one man, and hid the journals where no one could find them, knowing that when the journals are brought together, it would lead to a gateway of [...] "unimaginable power". Gideon says that codes and maps from the journal have led him to believe that the other book is hidden somewhere on the Mystery Shack's property.|$|E
