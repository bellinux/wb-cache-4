Lauderdale County, home to Meridian, has voted for the Republican candidate in every United States presidential election since 1972. Prior to the shift to the Republican Party, <b>white</b> <b>area</b> voters supported Democratic Party candidates, as for decades since the late nineteenth century, it was a one-party state.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the <b>White</b> <b>area</b> lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} and material losses were staggering. Numerous assessments {{were made to}} take account of the damage. According to the sources, between 4000 and 5000 buildings were destroyed, representing a third of the buildings in the city. Much of this was in a contiguous area where every building was destroyed, visible as the <b>white</b> <b>area</b> in the map {{at the top of the}} page. There were, of course, numerous islands of destruction from the shells throughout the city.|$|E

His sons Leo and Greg inherited his helmet design, but Leo's helmet has the red chin area and the white part that envelops the visor (not counting the top) is red with white outline, while Greg's helmet has the blue chin area and the <b>white</b> <b>area</b> that envelopes the visor is blue with white outline.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany horticultural {{and natural}} plant species have {{variegated}} leaves, that is, patchy leaves with green and non-green or <b>white</b> <b>areas.</b> Specific {{studies on the}} metabolism of variegated leaves are scarce and although <b>white</b> (non-green) <b>areas</b> have been assumed {{to play the role}} of a 'nitrogen store', there is no specific studies showing the analysis of nitrogenous metabolites and the dynamics of nitrogen assimilation. Here, we examined the metabolism of variegated leaves of Pelargonium × hortorum. We show that <b>white</b> <b>areas</b> have a larger N : C ratio, more amino acids, with a clear accumulation of arginine. Metabolomic analyses revealed clear differences in the chemical composition, suggesting contrasted metabolic commitments such as an enhancement of alkaloid biosynthesis in <b>white</b> <b>areas.</b> Using isotopic labelling followed by nuclear magnetic resonance or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we further showed that in addition to glutamine, tyrosine and tryptophan, N metabolism forms ornithine in green area and huge amounts of arginine in <b>white</b> <b>areas.</b> Fine isotopic measurements with isotope ratio mass spectrometry indicated that <b>white</b> and green <b>areas</b> exchange nitrogenous molecules but nitrogen export from green areas is quantitatively much more important. The biological significance of the metabolic exchange between leaf areas is briefly discussed...|$|R

25|$|As {{the player}} explores Rapture, he will collect ammo, health, {{recovery}} items, money and EVE (a liquid used to power plasmid use). Money {{can be used}} to purchase more items at vending machines scattered around the city. The player will also encounter security systems which can be hacked through a mini-game; this requires the player to stop a quick-moving needle one or more times in the correctly colored areas of a gauge. Stopping it within a green area progresses the sequence or potentially ends it; stopping in a blue area may grant a bonus to the hacking result, landing in a <b>white</b> <b>area</b> shocks the player (dealing a small amount of damage); and landing in a red area causes a security alert. The player also gains access to a research video camera. In BioShock 2, once the player begins recording an enemy, the player has a short time to damage that enemy in creative ways in order to score a number of points, which are then added towards the total research points of that enemy type. At various levels of research, the player is rewarded with new abilities. Certain areas of the game take place entirely underwater, limiting the actions the player can perform.|$|E

500|$|Transient: The diets {{of these}} whales consist almost {{exclusively}} of marine mammals. Transients generally travel in small groups, usually {{of two to}} six animals, and have less persistent family bonds than residents. Transients vocalize in less variable and less complex dialects. Female transients are characterized by more triangular and pointed dorsal fins than those of residents. The gray or <b>white</b> <b>area</b> around the dorsal fin, known as the [...] "saddle patch", often contains some black colouring in residents. However, the saddle patches of transients are solid and uniformly gray. Transients roam widely along the coast; some individuals have been sighted in both southern Alaska and California. Transients are {{also referred to as}} Bigg's killer whale in honor of cetologist Michael Bigg. The term has become increasingly common and may eventually replace the transient label.|$|E

500|$|The breed was a {{freckled}} white {{dog with}} either liver or black markings, the breed standard in 1859 set their measurements at [...] in height at the withers. It had long legs, feathered ears, a <b>white</b> <b>area</b> on forehead, which {{was said to}} [...] " [...] {{a great deal to}} his beauty", [...] but there were differences from the English Springer, including a broader skull and shorter neck. It was also compared to the English Setter in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.|$|E
500|$|The club mascot is a {{character}} called [...] "Filbert Fox". There are also secondary characters [...] "Vickie Vixen" [...] and [...] "Cousin Dennis." [...] Since 1992, the club's badge has featured a fox's head overlaid onto a Cinquefoil; the Cinquefoil {{is similar to the}} one used on the coat of arms of Leicester. Prior to 1992, the club's badge had a range of designs. In the 2009–10 season, the club's 125th anniversary year, the home kit featured no sponsor and a new central crest with [...] "125 Years" [...] written beneath it. Following this year, the club's crest was reverted again but with some changes which are reflected {{in the design of the}} current badge. The alterations included the fox in the crest having a <b>white</b> <b>area</b> under its nose, and more spacing between the letters. The football based circles either side of the crest were also removed.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{growing up}} in the {{predominantly}} <b>white</b> <b>area</b> of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Dixon's father Melvin would take her to the Notting Hill Carnival in London to allow her to experience some of her Jamaican heritage. The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – I heard them at Notting Hill". When asked during an interview who her favourite songwriter was, Dixon replied: [...] "Lauryn Hill. I love Lauryn Hill because she is not scared to talk about real life. She may say things that are slightly controversial but she gets people thinking and gets people talking". Dixon has also named Neneh Cherry as great influence upon her. Cherry, a mixed race singer, inspired her from an early age, with Dixon saying, [...] "I remember seeing Neneh Cherry on the TV when I was little and turning to my mum and saying, 'Mummy, she looks like me'".|$|E

500|$|Prost uses {{a helmet}} design {{based on the}} three colours of the French flag, those being blue, white and red, along with his name along the side. During his early career however, Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180° flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, {{surrounding}} the top). During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the <b>white</b> <b>area</b> become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half {{in the rear of}} the top)[...] Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.|$|E
2500|$|According to its {{physical}} description, the flag's features signify the following: [...] "The blue {{color in the}} upper rectangle symbolizes {{the grandeur of the}} Pernambuco sky. The color the <b>white</b> <b>area</b> is for peace. The three-colored rainbow represents the union of all the people of Pernambuco. The star indicates the state within the grouping of the Federation. The sun is the force and energy of Pernambuco, and finally, the cross represents our faith in justice and mutual understanding." ...|$|E

2500|$|The robot {{starts in}} an area marked as 'base', a <b>white</b> <b>area</b> in the corner or {{to one side of}} the table. [...] In base, two team members are allowed to touch the robot and start program. [...] If the team touches the robot while it is outside of base (an 'interruption'), the referee will issue a penalty. These are {{stationary}} LEGO models that negate the final score if they remain until the end, providing an incentive to not interrupt the robot. [...] The robot is not required to return to base; some teams have completed all their missions without returning to base during the time allowed to complete the missions. [...] In fact, in the 2008–09, 2009-10, 2011-2012, and 2012-13 challenges, points were awarded if the robot was in one of two specified areas, not including base, at the end of the two and a half minute match.|$|E
2500|$|The {{finished}} product was a 20-by-20inch oil {{painting of a}} man {{sitting in a chair}} in an all-white room with his back facing the audience. The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just a guy who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm. The minimal <b>white</b> <b>area</b> surrounding the figure is more important than the figure itself, being that it can represent health or paranoia."
