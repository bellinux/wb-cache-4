I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|While Dear has {{received}} praise for [...] "remarkably... retain {{most of the}} source novel's complex plot and numerous characters", literary scholars have noted {{significant differences between the}} film and the source material. Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> in the novel. Morrison cites Anne's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith—where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative—in the film as an example, as [...] "Austen's narrator makes it abundantly clear that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality". The film's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel, such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession. Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film, particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne's inner thoughts.|$|E

2500|$|Journalist James Traub {{wrote that}} [...] "Manhattan is a remorseless place to which its {{citizens}} are peculiarly adapted. and of which out-of-towners seem unaccountably fond.

A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying, [...] "Speculation is rife about returning characters but this is not true. However, as with all characters, we <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> never."

2500|$|About 7,000 French Jews {{moved to}} Israel in 2014. [...] This was 1% {{of the entire}} French Jewish {{population}} and a record number since World War II. Conversations within the European Jewish community indicate that antisemitic attacks in France are {{the impetus for the}} high emigration figures. Valls expressed his concern about the trend: [...] "If 100,000 French people of Spanish origin were to leave, I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> that France is not France anymore. [...] But if 100,000 Jews leave, France will no longer be France. [...] The French Republic will be judged a failure." [...] The trend of increased emigration continued into 2015 due to a rise in assaults and intimidation by Muslim extremists.|$|E

It's too whack, nobody'd make this up. Nobody <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> that you..." [...] However, Torque blacks out, and when he awakens, Miles is dead. Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|Mack was {{somewhat}} more guarded in his investigations and {{interpretations of the}} abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that [...] "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." [...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say,</b> yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is {{but it seems to me}} that it invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E

50|$|Face to face {{conversation}} is increasingly deemed less important {{when people have}} already seen all the relevant news about the other person they have already shared online.

To this extent the decreasing popularity of face to face conversation {{can be seen as}} a loss to society and civility.|$|R
5000|$|On February 18, 2012, Bretos {{used the}} term [...] "chink in the armor" [...] in {{reference}} to New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin, an Asian, while on air as an ESPNews anchor.

2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say,</b> 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, because you never really know someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E

We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I feel, they can go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned you have to fight to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> certain things — not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E

2500|$|The Miranda {{character}} receives {{negative comments}} to her videos from viewers who are {{fooled by the}} character and {{believe that they are}} watching a serious video by a bad entertainer. Ballinger told Backstage: [...] "It's sort of like an Andy Kaufman thing. You wouldn't believe the hate mail. ... You <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say</b> that stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering because they see, perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." [...] Fans of the character who are studying the performing arts say that Miranda is [...] "a role model and a 'strong woman in comedy'" [...] that inspires confidence in their performance and social skills.|$|E
2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E

She remained close to her sister Bertha at this time as they still shared a house and also enjoyed time at her home in Point Judith.|$|R
