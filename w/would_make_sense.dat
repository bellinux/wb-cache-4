5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, and <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for {{elements such as}} the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as the artist who brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E

25|$|Many {{specific}} {{points by}} Ehrman {{concentrate on what}} may {{be regarded as the}} 'embarrassments' and 'failures' of the various depictions of Jesus Christ found in the gospels and the works of Paul which point to an account based on a real person that got embellished rather than a completely made up figure. He notes that Jews in the first century AD expected their Messiah to come from Bethlehem while Jesus is described as growing up in Nazareth, a dilemma that is simply not addressed in the Gospel of Mark (which has no nativity account) even though it is regarded as the earliest gospel. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is another example, as critics of early Christianity found it strange that the Messiah would display the lack of personal awareness and foresight even to keep his close followers in line. Ehrman states that such things <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for a historical Jesus whom multiple people believed grew up, lived, and died in a certain time and place versus a purely mythological figure with malleable personal details.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} greater variety of stories {{in the first half of}} series 6 [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was moved to the second block of episodes, having been filmed as episode four and showing up in promos for the first half of the season. This necessitated minor changes to the episode, {{including}} the removal of a recurring sequence featuring the appearance of Madame Kovarian. The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> at that point in the series. This scene consisted of nursery rhyme; lead writer Steven Moffat wanted to foreshadow the Doctor's death and asked Gatiss to write a nursery rhyme, which he described as [...] "rather wonderful". Variations of the rhyme are heard in [...] "Closing Time" [...] and the series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song".|$|E

500|$|For the album, {{the band}} {{wanted to create}} the {{atmosphere}} of hyperactivity they knew [...] their fans wanted. They wrote a few songs, but felt the songs [...] "weren't strong enough" [...] {{and sent them to}} other musicians. Shay Haley, a member of the band, explained that in their new work, the band wanted to add energy to the emotional appeal of their past albums, though the band did not conceive a clear plan for the direction of the new album. N.E.R.D described the desired outcomes of [...] the album as [...] "a pre-cognitive effort to make music that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for us on while we're on a stage and to recapture that feeling we love so much" [...] and additionally, [...] "to make something that was thought provoking and for people to listen to it and enjoy it on their own time".|$|E
500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's [...] "side" [...] in the battle between dunces and men of wit.|$|E
500|$|Before production, the {{existing}} characters {{were added to}} the story either in places they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to appear or as cameos from a list of characters suggested by the film's creative team, without consideration if they would legally {{be able to use the}} characters. The company then sought out the copyright holders' permissions to use the characters, as well as working with these companies to assure their characters were being represented authentically. In the case of Nintendo, the writers had early on envisioned the Bad-anon meeting with Bowser as a major character within the scene; according to Moore, Nintendo was very positive towards this use, stating in Moore's own words, [...] "If there is a group that is dedicated to helping the bad guy characters in video games then Bowser must be in that group!" [...] Nintendo had asked that the producers try to devise a scene that would be similarly appropriate for Mario for his inclusion in the film. Despite knowing they would be able to use the character, the producers could not find an appropriate scene that would let Mario be a significant character without taking away the spotlight from the main story and opted to not include the character. Moore debunked a rumor that Mario and his brother character Luigi were not included due to Nintendo requesting too high a licensing fee, stating that the rumor grew out of a joke John C. Reilly made at Comic-Con.|$|E

500|$|The series' {{background}} music is composed by William Kevin Anderson, and Daniel Ingram composes the songs, which are only included if they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in the episode's script. The production team identifies specific {{parts of the}} episode where they want music cues, allowing Anderson to create appropriate music for each. Ingram works alongside Anderson's compositions to create vocal songs that mesh with the {{background music}} while filling out the show's fantasy setting. The composition {{of the music and}} songs far precedes the broadcast of the episode; for example, songs for the show's third season that began airing in November 2012 were composed in 2011. Ingram considered that songs from previous shows of My Little Pony were [...] "a little bit dated" [...] and decided to bring more interesting work to the Friendship Is Magic series. Such changes include making songs with more emotional depth than typical for children's animation, and tending to write songs that can be enjoyed musically outside of the context of the episode. Ingram's songs have [...] "became bigger and more epic, more Broadway and more cinematic over time" [...] with Hasbro blessing the effort to try [...] "something groundbreaking for daytime television", according to Ingram. Lyrics and overall musical themes may be suggested by the writers; two examples include songs written by Amy Keating Rogers, who is a self-professed Stephen Sondheim fan. The song [...] "The Art of the Dress" [...] in the first-season episode [...] "Suited for Success" [...] is inspired by [...] "Putting it Together" [...] from the musical Sunday in the Park with George, while the season one finale's song, [...] "At The Gala", is based on Sondheim's Into the Woods. A large musical number in the episode [...] "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" [...] paid homage to the song [...] "Ya Got Trouble" [...] from Meredith Willson's musical, The Music Man.|$|E
