Rich Brown of CNet said the mouse does not warrant the high price tag and awarded it an overall rating of 7.3/10. The reviewers at PC Magazine thought the Epic was expensive, but commended the mouse's attractiveness and wireless feature. Mathew McCurley of Engadget commended the long-lasting battery and the <b>wireless</b> <b>capability</b> of the mouse and stated that [...] "if you're interested in trying something new, give it a shot."

50|$|<b>Wireless</b> <b>capability</b> {{is a key}} {{requirement}} for most enterprise mobility applications, {{and it has been}} reported that wireless-transmission failure rates are three times higher for non-rugged notebooks compared to rugged units. This difference is attributed to the greater experience of rugged-notebook vendors at integrating multiple radios into their products. Each transmission failure leads to five to ten minutes in lost productivity as the user has to re-login to the company network through a VPN.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} strengths of the neurotrophic electrode is its <b>wireless</b> <b>capability,</b> because without transdermal wiring, the risk of infection is significantly reduced. As neural signals are collected by the electrodes, they travel up the gold wires and through the cranium, where they are {{passed on to the}} bioamplifiers (usually implemented by differential amplifiers). The amplified signals are sent through a switch to a transmitter, where they are converted to FM signals and broadcast with an antenna. The amplifiers and the transmitters are powered by a 1 MHz induction signal that is rectified and filtered. The antenna, amplifiers, analog switches, and FM transmitters are all contained in a standard surface mount printed circuit board that sits just under the scalp. The whole ensemble is coated in protective gels, Parylene, Elvax, and Silastic, to make it biocompatible and to protect the electronics from fluids.|$|E
5000|$|A logger {{comprises}} sensors such as accelerometers, storage media, {{a processor}} and power supply. The sensors measure and store shocks either {{as the entire}} waveform, summary data, or an indication of whether a threshold value was observed [...] Some devices have accelerometers built into the unit while others can use external accelerometers. The processor processes the measured data and saves it on the storage media together with the associated measurement times. This allows the measurement data to be retrieved after the measurements have been completed, either directly on the logger or via an interface to a computer. Some have an RFID interface.Software is used to present the measured data {{in the form of}} tables or graphs and provides functions for the evaluation of the measurement data.The shock and vibration data is either recorded continuously over a defined time period or on an event-driven basis where the recording of data is determined by certain criteria. Employing such an event-based measurement method allows the recording of specific shocks that exceed a critical length of time or strength. Some have <b>wireless</b> <b>capability</b> such as Bluetooth transmissions to smart phones.|$|E
50|$|On 28 March 1910 at the Easter {{camp for}} {{military}} training exercises at Heathcote, Lieutenant George Augustine Taylor, {{an officer in}} the Intelligence Corps of the Militia, organised the first military wireless (radio) transmissions in Australia to demonstrate the strategic possibilities of the technology to monitor and report on enemy troop movements. As the military had no <b>wireless</b> <b>capability</b> Lt Taylor co-opted the services of 3 civilian experts who volunteered to carry out the experiments. The three civilians Messers Kirkby, Hannam and Wilkinson brought all their own equipment with them. They arrived at Heathcote by train and all their equipment was dumped on the platform. Two sites were established to conduct the tests from a station A and a station B. Station A was in a tent adjacent to the gatekeepers cottage at Heathcote Station. Station B was 2 miles to the south in a cave on a landmark 'Spion Kop' in what is now Heathcote National Park. The purpose of the demonstration was to observe enemy troop movements from the south. It was assumed that the enemy were encamped 7 miles to the south at Garrawarra. The experiments were successful and Taylor gave all credit to the civilian experts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of wireless technology and identifies a number of higher education institutions that have used, or {{are in the process of}} developing wireless LANs. Some suggestions are offered as to how to address the problems and challenges that exist for the implementation of wireless LANs on campus. Most institu-tions of higher education are not considered leading-edge telecommunication organizations due to their lack of funding, especially when compared to their commercial counterparts. True, there are some major universities that are research oriented and are blessed with adequate funding for research from grants and substantial endowments, but most cam-puses are just now becoming completely wired and have started to fully use applications like e-mail, distance learning, and Web-based classroom management. The idea of taking these newly established wired networks and replacing them with <b>wireless</b> <b>capability</b> makes no sense. However, the idea of extending <b>wireless</b> <b>capability</b> to classrooms and labs that have not been previously connected has a great deal of merit...|$|E
