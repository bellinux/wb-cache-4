5|$|On the July 24 Impact Wrestling, Hardy {{told the}} {{audience}} that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen the last of Willow and then brought out Matt Hardy, his brother, to reform The Hardys. The Wolves joined them in the ring and challenged them to a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at , which the Hardys agreed to. At Destination X, the Hardys lost against the Wolves, but shook hands after the match. On October 22, 2014, The Hardys entered a number one contenders tournament for the TNA World Tag Team Championships defeating The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z) {{in the first round}} of the tournament. On October 29, episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys defeated Team Dixie (EC3 and Tyrus) in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the tournament where they defeated Samoa Joe and Low Ki to become number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the January 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy along with his brother Matt were at ringside for The Wolves vs. James Storm and Abyss; during the match, The Great Sanada and Manik attempted to interfere in the match, but then ended up receiving a Side Effect from Matt Hardy, and a Twist of Fate from Jeff Hardy. Despite that, it distracted Eddie Edwards, who then received a Last Call super kick from Storm. At the Lockdown episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy suffered a minor concussion which was set as a storyline injury when he fell on the door of the cage; James Storm hit Hardy off the door onto the steel steps below with a cowbell. The falling off the cage spot was covered in mainstream media such as USA Today and TMZ. Hardy returned after TNA United Kingdom tour. In March, The Hardys participated in a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. On March 16, 2015, The Hardys won an Ultimate X match for the belts for the first time as a team and individually. On May 8, 2015, the Hardys were forced to vacate the TNA World Tag Team Championship due to Jeff suffering a broken leg in a legitimate dirt bike accident.|$|E

It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians.

[...] "I {{began to ask}} myself whether... <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of time before we would unleash it." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the controversy, Cotton continued a dialogue with some of those who had gone to Aquidneck Island (called Rhode Island at the time). [...] One of these correspondents was his friend from Lincolnshire William Coddington. [...] Coddington wrote {{that he and his wife}} had heard that Cotton's preaching had changed dramatically since the controversy ended: [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> knowne what he had holden forth before we knew not how to understand him." [...] Coddington then deflected Cotton's suggestions that he reform some of his own ideas and [...] "errors in judgment". [...] In 1640, the Boston church sent some messengers to Aquidneck, but they were poorly received. [...] Young Francis Hutchinson, a son of Anne, attempted to withdraw his membership from the Boston church, but his request was denied by Cotton.|$|E
500|$|Intelligence {{gained from}} solving {{high-level}} German ciphers—intelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that [...] "it {{is widely believed}} that Ultra saved the world {{at least two years}} of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning." [...] The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having [...] "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". [...] The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: [...] "Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, {{researchers}} reported that particle {{data from the}} spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which {{are thought to be}} cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun. Ed Roelof, space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that [...] "Most scientists involved with Voyager 1 would agree that [...] have been sufficiently satisfied." [...] However, the last criterion for officially declaring that Voyager 1 had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged. On December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, [...] "Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out." [...] The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than Voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.|$|E

We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that each one of them serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of something that needs filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard."

Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes.
