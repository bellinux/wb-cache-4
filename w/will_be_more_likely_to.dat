5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance {{will be required to}} manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Palermo in August and in September became the senior {{officer in the}} Mediterranean after Jervis' successor Lord Keith left to chase the French and Spanish fleets into the Atlantic. Nelson {{spent the rest of}} 1799 at the Neapolitan court but put to sea again in February 1800 after Lord Keith's return. On 18 February Généreux, a survivor of the Nile, was sighted and Nelson gave chase, capturing her after a short battle and winning Keith's approval. Nelson had a difficult relationship with his superior officer: he was gaining a reputation for insubordination, having initially refused to send ships when Keith requested them and on occasion returning to Palermo without orders, pleading poor health. Keith's reports, and rumours of Nelson's close relationship with Emma Hamilton, were also circulating in London, and Earl Spencer wrote a pointed letter suggesting that he return home: You <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recover your health and strength in England than in any inactive situation at a foreign Court, however pleasing the respect and gratitude shown to you for your services may be.|$|E

40|$|The current {{dissertation}} research {{examines the}} role of group-level justice on individuals' behavioral and affective reactions to mistreatment in organizations. In the affective event model of organizational mistreatment proposed here, affective reactions to specific events are moderated by group-level justice and these affective reactions also mediate perceptions of mistreatment and subsequent behavioral reactions. As {{one of the important}} context variables, individuals use group-level justice as a reference point for their own evaluations of unfair events. Individuals under high levels of group-level justice perceive injustice from their experience of mistreatment more strongly than others because their norms and expectations are clearly violated. As a result of this, behaviors driven by strong negative affect felt by those under high group-level justice <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> and behaviors driven by attitude (e. g. cynicism) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> under low group-level justice. Using field survey data from 77 teams and 333 individuals, these theoretical propositions on the moderating role of group-level justice are examined. By examining the cross-level moderating effects of group-level justice and the differential effects of distinct negative emotions (anger vs. depression) on leading certain behavioral reactions, the current research contributes to a deeper understanding of how individual- and group-level factors interact in organizations...|$|R

25|$|Elizabeth Cashdan {{proposed}} that mate strategies among both genders differ {{depending on how}} much parental investment is expected of the male, and provided research support for her hypotheses.

In addition, men who expect to invest <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> highlight their chastity and fidelity than men who expect not to invest. Men with the expectation of low parental investment will flaunt their sexuality to women. The author argues the fact the research supports the idea that men expecting to invest emphasise their chastity and fidelity, which is a high cost strategy (because it lowers reproductive opportunities), suggests that that type of behaviour must be beneficial, or the behaviour would not have been selected.|$|E

Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from sampling bias because children with otitis media <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{evidence}} on the effect of child health on marital stability and family structure within an economic framework. We use the 1988 National Health Interview Survey's Child Health Supplement, with a sample of about 9, 000 families to test whether having an unhealthy child decreases the mother's chance of being married, and whether it increases her chance of living in an extended family. Using two different measures of child health, we find that having an unhealthy child does decrease the mother's likelihood of being married. Our results are strongest for white women who were married at the time of the child's birth and for black women who were unmarried at that time. These results imply that children in poor health will, <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> face obstacles beyond their illness, since they <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer consequences of poverty and poor schooling outcomes which results when raised in a female headed household. The only mitigating factor is that, for white children, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than healthy children to living in an extended family. ...|$|R
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{say that}} natural {{selection}} has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, {{in much the}} same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating. For male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E
25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|E
