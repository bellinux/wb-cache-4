EC babies are free from the problems of conventional diapering such as diaper rash, diaper change battles, not being able to explore diapered parts of their bodies, vulnerability to urinary tract infections, and potentially delayed or difficult potty training. Gross-Loh also reports that EC promotes a unique and wonderful bond between babies and caregivers.|$|R

Some onsen allow one to wear the towel into the baths, while others have posted signs prohibiting this, saying that it makes it harder to clean the bath. It is sometimes against the rules to immerse or dip towels in the onsen bath water, since this can be considered unclean. In this latter case, people normally set their towels {{off to the side of}} the water when enjoying the baths, or place their folded towels on top of their heads.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring and {{assessment}} of fresh water has become an environmental concern due to the contamination by human kind, thereby decreasing the suitability of the fresh water. The Kukshet Lake, which is the study area of the present investigation receives domestic raw sewage from surrounding habitation; so also the activities like cattle <b>washing,</b> <b>cloth</b> <b>washing,</b> bathing, religious activities like idol immersion, etc., paves the way for high concentration of harmful chemicals in the lake water. The study was carried out to understand the various physico-chemical parameters {{as well as to}} estimate the concentration of heavy metals in lake water. It was found that the concentration of the heavy metals in the lake water substantially increased after the religious activities around September to October. These heavy metals have a marked effect on the aquatic flora and fauna which through bio-magnification enter the food chain and ultimately affect human beings as well. environmental pollution; physico-chemical parameters; heavy metals; religious activity; sewage; toxicity; water pollution; India; water quality; lake water. ...|$|R

I will extend this “no movement ” approach to a range of wh-constructions in Malagasy and show that there is neither overt nor covert movement of wh-elements to the clause periphery. This conclusion fits well with recent work on the left periphery in other V-initial languages (see, e. g., Oda 2002 and Massam 2003). As was initially noted by Dahl (1986), Malagasy wh-questions are clefts, where the wh-word is in fact the matrix (copular) predicate, and the presuppositional clause is a headles...|$|E
40|$|Forty-eight dairy herds in Ohio were {{selected}} as a {{stratified random sample}} for participation in a disease monitoring study to relate the prevalence of IMI with coliform and environmental streptococci to herd management and environmental conditions. Management and environmental conditions were assessed by farm inspection and by {{an interview with the}} dairy producers. A separate analysis for each independent variable identified many potential disease determinants. A multivariable analysis of a covariance model to predict the prevalence of coliforms had 6 model df (R 2 =. 47). Increased prevalence of coliform infection was associated with an increased amount of milk remaining in the udder after milking, use of free stalls, regular use of a running water wash, increased person hours per cow spent milking, and poor sanitation. The multivariable model for environmental streptococci used 5 model df (R 2 =. 51).

Its diagnosis and treatment requires a good knowledge of its determinant and predisposing factors. The comparative epidemiology of 349 walloon farms registered to individual milk analysis programs led to highlight the practices used in farms whose last 3 months' herd somatic cell count was above 400. 000 cells/ml. We identified the following risk indicators relative to 1) herd demography : age, composition, herd production average, percentage of high cell counts animals 2) the animal housing : use of straw as bedding stall for all classes of animals and lack of a calving pen 3) the milking machine : milking cups cleaning 4) the dairy practices : lack of <b>washing</b> <b>cloth</b> towels between 2 milkings, occasional foremilk check, stripping, lack of post-dip and 5) animal nutrition : mould on beet pulp silos and composition of the main concentrate.
