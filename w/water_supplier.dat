While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal <b>water</b> <b>supplier</b> in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.|$|E
500|$|Carr Hill by 1820 was {{a modern}} and populous village, {{situated}} on hill, still isolated from Gateshead and Felling. A variety of industries had developed alongside Warburton's pottery and were prospering; a flint glass manufacturer, under {{the management of}} Alexander Elliot, three corn mills- Carr Hill Mill, Felling Windmill and St John's Mill (the latter built after an earlier mill was destroyed by a mysterious fire in 1824)– and a fire brick kiln. There were also three inns and [...] "some neat houses occupied by respectable families". [...] By 1840 Carr Hill Reservoir had been built and, under {{the management of the}} Newcastle Water Company was the major <b>water</b> <b>supplier</b> for residents in Carr Hill, Sheriff Hill and Windy Nook, and freestone quarries, similar to Kells' Quarry in Windy Nook, were producing Newcastle Grindstone of excellent quality. In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms. By the mid-19th century Carr Hill Reservoir was {{in the hands of the}} Whittle Dean Water Company, and in 1883 was converted into a 10-million imperial gallon (45 million l; 12 million US gal) open reservoir.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{in the city of}} Harare, Zimbabwe’s largest urban metropolis and capital. Bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> began in 2005 to sell domestic water to middle- and high-income suburbs because of shortcomings in the city’s water delivery system without state regulation, and have since become a permanent feature of the Zimbabwean urban waterscape. The study was conducted between 2012 and 2013 in three up-market suburbs of Harare, which were known to depend on bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers.</b> State regulation of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> was introduced in 2013, close to a decade after the start of operations, indicating a reactive and reluctant acknowledgement that bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> were now significant players in water service provision. The regulation was, however, poorly conceptualised, based on potable water standards, which proved to be cumbersome and placed onerous demands on the suppliers. The paper concludes that bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> are playing a critical role in water service provision in Zimbabwe’s largest metropolis and represent a spontaneous injection of local private capital in the urban domestic water supply sector. They can therefore be seen as a viable endogenous form of privatisation of urban domestic water service (as contrasted to multinational companies) but should be viewed as complementing rather than replacing functional urban water supply systems. The operations of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> can be enhanced if a regulatory regime, informed by realities on the ground is crafted...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe collection, {{storage and}} use of {{rainwater}} from roofs {{reduce the need for}} potable water. However if <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> are to decrease their infrastructure costs as well as their operational costs (due to water savings), the rainwater system has to provide most of the time a significant percentage of the water demand. This paper adopts the view point of the <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> and investigates how reliable this source of water is {{in the case of a}} housing estate, considering WC flushing as the only water demand. A housing estate was modelled and different realistic input scenarios (water demand for WC flushing, storage capacity, roof area, and rainfall) were defined. Three indicators were exhibited. The variability generated by each input on the indicators was evaluated. The indicators were estimated for 63 homogeneously distributed French cities. Among the indicators exhibited in this paper, the most relevant one is the percentage of water supplied from the tank that is secured during 95 % of the days of the simulation. The main conclusion is that the optimum way of determining the storage capacity of the rainwater collection system is not the same from the viewpoint of the users than from the viewpoint of the <b>water</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Indeed, <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> tend to require bigger tanks in order to take into account the rainwater collection systems in their management plan...|$|R
