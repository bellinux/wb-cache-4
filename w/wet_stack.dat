40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of salting on dried (SD) and <b>wet</b> <b>stack</b> (WS) during the drying of arenca from determining mass transfer coefficients (Kc) and diffusivity (Da). Moisture content and NaCl of arenca sheets according to time was determined during salting SD and WS. Data were analyzed in the PHARM/PSC® version 4 program, and the least significant difference test (DMS) was applied when a difference between the averages was observed. These data are used in a mathematical model for determining mass transfer coefficients and diffusivity. It was used for this equation concentration in function of time and position for an infinite slab of thickness 2 L. It was observed that the best conditions of transfer were made for salted with SD. Depending on the type of salt no significant effects were found (p < 0, 05) on the transfer of water and NaCl, but whether as long as it remains in the sample solution (p < 0, 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Under Round 4 of the U. S. Department of Energy`s (DOE) Clean Coal Technology program, New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG), in {{partnership}} with Saarberg-Holter-Umwelttechnik (SHU), Consolidation Coal Company and Stebbins Engineering and Manufacturing Company, has retrofitted a formic acid enhanced forced oxidation wet limestone scrubber on Units I and 2 at the Milliken Steam Electric Station. Units I and 2 are 1950 s vintage Combustion Engineering tangentially fired pulverized coal units, which are rated at nominal 150 MW each and operate in balanced draft mode. The Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) system for Unit 2 was placed into operation in January 1995 and the Unit I system in June 1995. The project incorporates several unique aspects: low pH operation; a ceramic tile-lined cocurrent/countercurrent, split module absorber; a <b>wet</b> <b>stack</b> supported {{on the roof of}} the FGD building; and closed loop, zero liquid discharge operation that produces commercial grade gypsum and calcium chloride brine. The project objectives include 98 % SO{sub 2 } removal efficiency while burning high sulfur coal, the production of marketable byproducts to minimize solid waste disposal, zero wastewater discharge, space-saving design, and minimization of maintenance requirements of a wet scrubber. The paper provides a brief overview of the project scrubber design relating to maintenance considerations. A discussion of the early results of the maintenance history is also provided. Repair techniques that have been developed and tested for ceramic tile lined modules are included. 1 fig...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere are {{a number}} of factors that an {{operator}} should consider before pursuing <b>wet</b> or dry <b>stacking</b> of the phosphogypsum by-product from a phosphoric acid plant. In addition to process considerations, important factors include the climatologic regime, water balance considerations, hydrogeology, topography, capital cost, operating cost (and maintenance), closure costs (and handling of drainable pore water), availability (or scarcity) of a fresh water source, distance from the plant to the disposal site (and viability of dry versus wet transport methods), P 2 O 5 recovery, impacts on the environment (from leakage, dusting, accidental spills, etc.) and applicable regulations. A review of dry/wet transport methods and dry/wet disposal methods is presented using illustrative examples from various countries worldwide, with particular emphasis on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>wet</b> and dry <b>stacking</b> in the various environments. In most instances, <b>wet</b> <b>stacking</b> is preferred over dry stacking based on economic and maintenance considerations.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} liquid morphology on the apparent transfer properties of porous media formed by stacked particles, the authors investigate the particles’ aggregation state, apparent volume, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of <b>wet</b> <b>stacked</b> glass beads. It shows that the liquid mainly exists as liquid bridges when the liquid content is low and connects each other when high. The transformation of liquid morphology and distribution influences the liquid effects on particles, thus changing the aggregation state of the particles and the apparent properties of the porous media in turn. A model is developed for predicting the critical liquid content at which the liquid morphology shifts {{from the state of}} liquid bridges into the state of interconnectedness. The prediction from the model is in good agreement with the experiment...|$|R

Assuming that the QD in the stacked layer is grown at the position where the lattice distortion is minimal, we estimated the critical thickness of spacer layer between QD layers to make QDs align in growth direction, that agrees well with previously reported values in experiments...|$|R
50|$|Work on Caboonbah Homestead {{commenced}} in late 1889 and {{was completed}} {{during the summer}} floods of 1890. The brickmaker employed at Mount Stanley made 30,000 bricks {{at the head of}} Sapphire Gully, {{to the west of the}} house, and erected a service building containing a bakery, washhouse and storerooms. The oven fire also was used to heat water, which was then piped to the adjoining washhouse. The locally produced bricks proved to be very brittle, so bricks from Dinmore (near Ipswich) were ordered for the house chimneys. The house was constructed mostly of milled timber brought in from Nicholson's mill near Villeneuve, but some of the pine sawn at Mount Stanley was used in construction of the loft. The roof was clad in shingles, <b>stacked</b> <b>wet</b> and not dressed. This created a cooler roof, but in time the shingles warped and shrank.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{temperatures}} down to - 40 °C {{on the performance}} and component properties of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack was investigated. By analyzing the temperature-dependent high-frequency resistance, the mechanism of ice formation within the stack was investigated during freeze/thaw (F/T) cycling while the stack was not operating and during a cold start-up. A step-like change in conductivity at 0 °C indicates that the membranes are dehydrated at sub-zero temperatures due {{to a change in}} capillary pressure at the interface membrane/catalyst. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} stack shows little degradation when it is dried out before cooling down. Freezing in a wet state and additional cold start-ups resulted in performance degradation which was mainly attributed to changes in wetting properties. Ex situ environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) investigations showed distinct damage and increasing porosity of the electrode in the <b>wet</b> frozen <b>stack,</b> which was most likely the reason for the change in wetting properties. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy showed distinct concentrations of platinum in the exhaust gas of the dry cycled stack, but no additional platinum was found when the stack was cycled in a wet state. Additional ex situ F/T investigations of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) within an ESEM confirmed the results, found by in situ investigations of the fuel cell stacks. Serious detachment of electrode material was found without the compressive force applied to an assembly...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 06 NT 42726 was {{established}} in January 2006, and is current through Amendment 2, April 2006. The current reporting period, April 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008, is the eighth progress-reporting period for the project. However, this report will be the final report (instead of a quarterly report) because this project is being terminated. Efforts to bring this project to a close {{over the past several}} months focused on internal project discussions, and subsequent communications with NETL, regarding the inherent difficulty with completing this project as originally scoped, and the option of performing an engineering study to accomplish some of the chief project objectives. However, NETL decided that the engineering study did indeed constitute a significant scope deviation from the original concepts, and that pursuit of this option was not recommended. These discussions are summarized in the Results and Discussion, and the Conclusion sections. The objective of this project by a team lead by URS Group was to demonstrate the use of regenerative heat exchange to reduce flue gas temperature and minimize evaporative water consumption in wet flue gas desulphurization (FGD) systems on coal-fired boilers. Furthermore, the project intended to demonstrate that regenerative heat exchange to cool flue gas upstream of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and reheat flue gas downstream of the FGD system would result in the following benefits to air pollution control (APC) systems on coal-fired power plants: (1) Improve ESP performance due to reduced gas volume and improved ash resistivity characteristics, (2) Control SO 3 emissions through condensation on the fly ash, and (3) Avoid the need to install <b>wet</b> <b>stacks</b> or to provide flue gas reheat. Finally, operation at cooler flue gas temperatures offered the potential benefit of increasing mercury (Hg) removal across the ESP and FGD systems. This project planned to conduct pilot-scale tests of regenerative heat exchange to determine the reduction in FGD water consumption that can be achieved and assess the resulting impact on APC systems. An analysis of the improvement in the performance of the APC systems and the resulting reduction in capital and operating costs were going to be conducted. The tests were intended to determine the impact of operation of cooling flue gas temperatures on FGD water consumption, ESP particulate removal, SO{sub 3 } removal, and Hg removal, and to assess the potential negative impact of excessive corrosion rates in the regenerative heat exchanger. Testing was going to be conducted on Columbian coal (with properties similar to low-sulfur Eastern bituminous coal) and SO{sub 3 } will be spiked onto the flue gas to simulate operation with higher SO{sub 3 } concentrations resulting from firing a higher sulfur coal, or operating with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit. The project was also going to include associate planning, laboratory analytical support, reporting, and management activities. The URS project team finalized a conceptual alternative approach to demonstrate, via an engineering study, the use of regenerative heat exchange to reduce flue gas temperature and minimize evaporative water consumption. This idea was presented in summary format to NETL for consideration. NETL determined that this alternative approach deviated from the original project objectives, {{and that it would be}} in the best interest of all parties involved to cancel the project...|$|R
40|$|Hay-making {{at the end}} of {{the long}} rains in the drier, {{pastoral}} areas of Africa has definite advantages. It means less work for women in the dry season and higher calf survival. Recent research in southern Ethiopia by the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) has shown that Borana women, as in other traditional African societies, work up to 13 hours a day in the long dry season. Much of this time is taken up trekking into the bush to cut and collect standing grass for hand feeding to calves. Alternatively, if hay is made {{at the end of}} the <b>wet</b> season and <b>stacked</b> near the homestead, then the women can easily and quickly feed their calves in the dry season. It is easy to train people to make hay and the idea could spread quickly. Women can easily estimate the number of calves that will have to be fed in the dry season, and then set aside the appropriate area to be cut. Not only does hay make life easier for the women but it should mean the calves are fed better. ILCA has shown that the hay may have twice the crude protein of the cut grass- 7. 2 % compared to 3. 4 %. The nutrition can be enhanced further by collecting and feeding the pods of Acacia tortilis, the leaves of Acacia brevispica or cowpea hay. Any one of these is as good as lucerne, and very often readily available locally. For three months in the peak of the dry season a 40 kg calf would need about 80 kg of hay and 20 kg of the local legume materials to provide a balanced ration throughout that period. Life for women in the dry season can be eased further if water tanks are built near the homestead, which receive run-off during the wet season. Calves would benefit from water nearby and it is estimated that a third of the women's work load can be cut by the provision of water tanks and hay stacks.
