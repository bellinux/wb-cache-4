5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film.

5|$|Combs' uninspiring {{speeches and}} candidness {{about the need}} for more state revenue cost him the primary election. Chandler, who went on to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to raise taxes to meet the state's {{financial}} obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous and honest {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to education.|$|E

5|$|During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were {{approved}} by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, {{but this was not}} immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E
5|$|General William Howe {{had taken}} his army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, {{and he decided to}} advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E

But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E
5|$|With {{training}} camp starting on January 13, 2013, Vancouver recalled 12 {{players from the}} Wolves. They also bolstered their defence corp by signing NHL veterans Jim Vandermeer and Cam Barker to one-year contracts. At the forward position, the Canucks were dealing with injuries to their second line. Centre Ryan Kesler, who was recovering from off-season surgeries to his shoulder and wrist, {{would be unable to}} start the season; it was unknown how long he would be out rehabbing the injuries. Winger David Booth was injured during the team's physicals to start camp. After having an MRI done on his injury, it was announced that Booth would miss four to six weeks recovering. Alain Vigneault stated that he hoped to keep his third and fourth lines intact, leaving the possible replacements as, Andrew Ebbett, Jordan Schroeder and Zack Kassian. Schroeder was a first-round draft pick for Vancouver in 2009, but had never played in an NHL game. Ebbett a utility, journeyman forward played in 18 games for Vancouver in 2011–12. While the second-year Kassian produced only four goals in his rookie campaign. Vancouver elected to start the season with Ebbett and put Kassian on their second line. In order to keep defensive depth, the Canucks decided to keep nine defenceman. Schroeder was sent back to the minors in order to comply with the 23-man roster and because he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to clear waivers.|$|E

In such a case, the radiography phantom <b>would</b> <b>not</b> necessarily <b>need</b> to have similar textures and mechanical properties since these are not relevant in x-ray imaging modalities.
