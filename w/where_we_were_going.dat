[...] Characteristically, he added, [...] "If {{it was a}} situation <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting on {{location}} in New York City also added to Mackendrick’s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help {{and all the rest}} of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{an artist}} in metal {{living and working in}} {{the last part of the}} twentieth century, I feel it to be {{important}} that my work relate to this specific period of time.

500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to go from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{from the}} outset was {{described}} {{to be different from}} any previous work the band has done. [...] "We wanted to start with a clean slate because the last couple of records felt kind of compromised", said Foreman concerning the period the band had with Columbia Records after 2003's The Beautiful Letdown. He describes the time period with their former label as one filled with personnel turnover, which eventually led to their departure from Sony because [...] "we wanted to create an environment <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be with the same people {{for a long time and}} trust is established." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 8, 2015, Smith {{announced}} that {{plans to start}} shooting Clerks III in May 2015 were put on hold and instead his next film would be Mallrats 2. Smith said, [...] "We were talking about initially shooting Clerks III this summer {{and then we were}} going to get to Mallrats in the beginning of 2016. And then it jumped into 2015, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to shoot Clerks and then hopefully ‘Mallrats’ before the end of the year. But now, based on a fucking mall that we all dig that will be going away, the priority has become Mallrats. So the next fucking movie I’m making is Mallrats 2." [...] In June 2016, Smith {{announced that}} the plans for a Mallrats sequel had been turned into plans for a 10-episode TV series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{family did}} leave {{when he was}} five years old after Adams' uncle was killed in a mining accident. [...] "My father piled all our {{belongings}} into an old jalopy, with our bedding on top", Adams recalled. [...] "We didn't know <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> He started driving, and ran out of gas and money in Jersey City, New Jersey at Audubon Park. A man came over and started talking to us, a Mr. Cohn. He said to my father 'You look like you need a job,' and my father said 'I do'." [...] Adams' father was given a job as janitor of an apartment building along with living quarters in the basement. Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} albums and an EP, Samhain was signed {{to a major}} label by Rubin {{and the name of}} the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig {{discussed}} the reasoning behind the name change: “Rick [...] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with a lot more artistic freedom. After all, I was now in charge of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> musically, so if I didn't want to do something, it was a lot easier to say so." [...] Danzig's intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks–DOA–Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits.|$|E
2500|$|On a more literal level, Laurent Lebec {{states that}} [...] "I {{had no idea}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> with the music when we started doing these songs [...] he changes were pretty {{subconscious}} at first, then looking back we realized {{what was happening and}} we just went with it." [...] He continues to add [...] "when we were touring for our last album, The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, even if we had a 75-minute-long set, we could only play five songs because they were all so long, and that can be tiring for an audience." [...] They are also intent on making it clear that the album is not simply negative in message. [...] "The title also pays tribute to how amazing touring most often feels. It's also a tribute to the joy that burns inside when you reach a place and people who don't speak your language are rooting for your songs and welcoming you into their unique environment".|$|E

2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
