As they progress, players access other weapons {{including}} other handguns, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and hand-thrown weapons. To move the game along, the player is told <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> objective is through Max's internal monologue, in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.|$|E

The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. However, current form is to have the manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> pitch will be.|$|E

After hearing {{what they had to}} say, the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was [...] "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that [...] "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> steps would be. He returned after half an hour to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing who else would sign it afterwards.|$|E

According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} Chrissie in EastEnders meant that Oberman, more than most, {{had to endure}} the gruelling schedule of working on a soap, taping up to twenty scenes a day. Although she was only in EastEnders for 18 months, such was the centrality of Chrissie to the show and storylines Oberman felt she had done 4 years worth of acting, noting {{that by the time}} of her departure [...] "Chrissie has packed into a year what most soap characters do in three." [...] This all came during a period of great uncertainty for the show; media criticism and negative publicity created immense pressure behind-the-scenes, with large-scale cast culls and speculation in the press and on the set over who may be next. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman described the atmosphere as like a [...] "vacuum", with the cast [...] "just waiting to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> stage is – It can be a bit tense but it's exciting. I really don't know what's going to happen." [...] However, the prominent role of Chrissie in the show as it moved forward meant that Oberman came out of the uncertainty with more to show than most, receiving an improved deal and extending her contract for a year, with the BBC's head of drama John Yorke declaring he had [...] "big plans" [...] for Chrissie.|$|E
500|$|Miloš Forman's {{first feature}} film Cerný Petr (Black Peter) was {{released}} in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year's Locarno Film Festival, where it won the top prize, thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia's communist bureaucracy and {{making it possible for}} Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom. Unsure of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase. [...] He gave her a lift and learned her story: [...] she had come to the big city from Varnsdorf, where she had been seduced by a young engineer, who had given her a phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life. [...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for {{much of the rest of}} the night, before putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase. In Forman's words: [...] "I guess I'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bangkok {{and dinner}} {{incidents}} {{were believed to}} {{have been part of the}} basis for a report by Giovanni D'Orlandi, the Italian Ambassador in Saigon, passed on by Lodge to Washington on January 20. It alleged that Don and Dinh were potential leaders of a group that might go along with de Gaulle's neutralization plan. At the time, Lodge said that his office had no solid evidence that either of the pair was contemplating neutralization, but just after the coup, he cabled Washington to say he was rethinking his position. He said that Don and Kim retained their French citizenship and [...] "had never at any time foresworn the possibility of a neutral solution at what might seem to them the proper time." [...] He said that although he thought their policies against the communists were effective, [...] "none of us had ever discussed <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step would be after the Government of Vietnam had reached a position of strength. Perhaps they did favor the French neutrality solution at that time." [...] On the other hand, Undersecretary of State W. Averell Harriman had been told by staffers that the claims were merely a smokescreen disseminated by Khánh and his followers to gain support for a power grab. Lodge's personal staff had also failed to find evidence substantiating Khánh's charges. Lodge had put embassy employee Frederick Flott in charge of American-French liaison in South Vietnam. Flott found nothing to support the claims of a linkage between de Gaulle's proposal and Minh's junta and reported that many French contacts had bemoaned their lack of success in rallying Minh's administration to de Gaulle's proposal.|$|E
