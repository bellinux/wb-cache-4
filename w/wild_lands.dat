40|$|In {{a country}} such as Scotland, {{there is little}} land, if any, that has escaped the {{influence}} of humankind {{in one way or}} another. The degree of human influence varies along a continuum from, for example, the city centre office block, to a very remote mountain hilside. Despite the effects of human influence, the landscapes at the latter end of the continuum are stil perceived by many as wild and are relatively untouched. <b>Wild</b> <b>land</b> is valued for both utilitarian and intrinsic reasons and provides a range of benefits. However, owing to the subjective nature of current <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> definitions, these values and benefits are rarely taken into account in current land use management and new developments. The aim {{of this study was to}} define in spatial terms the concept of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland using people's visual perceptions of the landscape. This was achieved through the development of a method to define objectively <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> by quantifying the wildness of a location based on the surrounding landscape attributes. The main objectives of the study were an assessment of the physical and perceptual characteristics of <b>wild</b> <b>land,</b> the examination of the current wildness of a range of Scottish areas which in turn enabled the stability of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> perceptions over time to be evaluated in comparison with existing data. The perceptual nature of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and requires a broad range of opinion to be consulted in its definition. The use of a photographic questionnaire enabled the views of those living nearby and visiting potential <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> areas to be gathered. The photographs represented the range of characteristic landscape attributes within the two study areas of the Cairngorms and Wester Ross, and were rated for their wildness. The extent of visible landscape attributes was quantified using a geographical information system (G. I. S.) and was used along with wildness ratings to develop and test predictive wildness models using multiple linear regression techniques. Wildness models were then applied within each of the two study areas, producing maps of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> that could then be used in decisions on future planning and conservation issues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the general {{background}} context surrounding {{the issue of}} <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland. It explores definitions of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> and related concepts, identifies key issues associated with <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland, and explores {{the question of the}} desirability of designating areas as <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> for Scotland. There is increasing interest in the concept of ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, or ‘wilderness’ in Scotland, other parts of the UK and Europe. Changes in agricultural policy are leading to land abandonment in several European Union member states and in some cases ‘re-wilding’ is taking place with little or no managerial input from humans. These events have led to renewed interest across Europe in setting aside land with minimal management to create ‘wild’ areas. There has been either interest or activity, not always in the public sector, in Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Netherlands in exploring and establishing some form of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> area. Many of these are relatively small, with evidence of recent human activity, and, as such, are quite distinct from the concept of ‘wilderness’, which has been so influential in certain parts of the world (such as North America) in influencing the designation of areas of land for minimal management. In contrast there are the large areas of northern Scandinavia, which still contain ‘wilderness-like’ qualities, and to some extent are preserved in the wilderness areas and national parks of Finland, Sweden and Norway. Unfortunately, the terms ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, ‘wilderness’, come with an enormous amount of associated cultural baggage, resulting in argument and conflict over definitions, purpose, and management of potential <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> or wilderness areas. The aim {{of this paper is to}} unpack some of that baggage and clarify the key issues in the current discussions on <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> taking place in Scotland...|$|R
