Because the roots of the chords will sound whether we want them to or not, whether or not the {{alphabetical}} symbol is correct. The root progression which emerges may not coincide with what we think we have written; it may be better or it may be worse; but art does not permit chance. The root progression supports the work. The total root progression is heard as a substantive element, almost like another melody, and it determines the tonal basis of the music. And the tonal basis of a piece is very important to the construction of themes and to the orchestration.|$|E

As mentioned above, language barriers, uncertainty of oral tradition and lack of in-depth training and proper source material as well as the vast variety of schools can easily lead to terminological imprecision, misinterpretation and misunderstanding. An example at hand is the question of the Hara: what and where is the Hara or Dantian (tanden); <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> in both traditions; and how is it related to the Eight Extraordinary Vessels and the other energy pathways (meridians or channels).|$|E
50|$|Retailers {{are pushing}} for tagging each {{individual}} item. In fact, large companies like Wal-Mart, JC Penney, and Dillard’s are issuing electronic product code mandates, where they request their suppliers to comply with these EPC protocols. In 2005, it was required that the suppliers use RFID tagging at the pallet and case level, {{but now it is}} required that they tag on the item-level as well. The reason <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> for them to implement this is because they want to avoid losing a sale over an out-of-stock item, which they believe accounts for a big part of their losses. Also, if they know where an item is at all times then it easier to move it to where it is supposed to be. By doing this they reduce transportation costs, they gain added shelf visibility and it drives down wasteful overstock.|$|E

30|$|There {{is growing}} {{consensus}} among leaders today that business exists, {{not to make}} money, but {{to make the world}} better, and most agree that both employees and customers want to associate with enterprises that provide a sense of purpose. 90 % of executives have said that their companies understands the importance of purpose, but “only 46 percent said it informs their strategic and operational decision-making.” (Izzo and Vanderwielen, 2018). Every leader must have a purpose, and they have a responsibility to address this significant question: why do we exist? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that we exist? what is the contribution we want to make?

In what sense do animals and machines communicate? Are computers the only information technology? What {{is the value}} of information systems to organisations? This book considers the nature of significance and the way it is continually accomplished within activity, communication and representation. It argues that significance is generated at the intersection of signs and systems, which involves the enactment of forma (the substance of a sign), informa (the content of a sign) and performa (the use of signs in coordinated action). In demonstrating the value of this perspective the book employs the innovative approach of considering examples and cases from different times, cultures and species. This improves our {{understanding of the nature of}} information, information systems and information technology and the way these phenomena entangle in complex ways within human organisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will present some ideas about {{successful}} communication to obtain intersubjectivity/mutual understanding in systems development.

This {{is due to the fact}} that the communicators cannot fully express the meaning of something by means of language. The gap between what you can and cannot express has to be bridged by means of pedagogical support. The issues of learning and teaching are primarily discussed in relation to some common forms of cooperation in systems development, such as dialogues, group work and assembly meetings. The pedagogical premises for supporting communication and using methods to obtain mutual understanding are presented by means of various examples. 1...|$|E

40|$|As editors, {{one of the}} {{key issues}} we {{consider}} when deciding whether to send a manuscript for review is how well the paper has been theorised. Many of the submissions we receive describe projects that have been undertaken but do not explain to readers how the issues described can be understood, as though the description contains self-evident truths. Many such papers are not sent for review because they lack adequate theorisation. But what is ‘theory’ and <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important?</b> Theory, according to Richard Pring, can be understood as ‘the assumptions which lie behind practice’ and as ‘tightly organised systems of explanation’ (Pring, 2004, p. 77). A more systematic explanation can be contrasted with ideas that are said to be ‘common sense’. The importance of theorising teacher education is that it promotes scholarly inquiry, adds to a professional body of knowledge and has the potential to produce insights and alternative understandings. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to address a gap in {{scholarship}} concerning memory in Deuteronomy. While the trend in biblical studies has been to look at texts as memory products, we shall take a different tack by analyzing the text as a memory producer. That is, we look not at how cultural memory shaped Deuteronomy, but how Deuteronomy itself aims to shape cultural memory. We approach this task by leveraging appropriate tools from contemporary memory research, especially from the realms of linguistics, sociology, and psychology. We train them, in particular, on the what, the why, and the how: What is Deuteronomy's conception of memory, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important,</b> and how does the book seek to inculcate it? If {{it is true that}} Deuteronomy forwards memory as central to the covenant loyalty of the people, then the implications of this study are not insignificant.

40|$|What {{is meant}} by the vague {{expression}} "scientific communication"? And <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> nowadays that the sciences are put into question? The present paper addresses these fundamental issues {{by focusing on the}} connection, already emphasized by Jonas, between “to know” and “to do”. This connection characterizes the actual state of techno-sciences and grounds their power to transform the condition of human experience. By drawing on Arendtian categories, this essay therefore claims for the importance of a public discussion on science and highlights the gap between scientific discourse and the “normal thought and discourse expression” when referred to the human experience. In this frame, the ambivalent role played by the phenomenon of ignorance within human relations – often neglected in the philosophical reflection, whit the exception of Sartre – should be taken into account. This is particularly relevant when considering the evident knowledge asymmetry between scientists and lay people. The essay intends to demonstrate how philosophy can contribute to a concrete public discussion on science, by outlining a notion of power linked to communication processes and flows and by highlighting its constraints, beyond the so-called Diskursethik approach...|$|E
