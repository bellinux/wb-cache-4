5|$|On December 7, 2006, Iginla reached career {{milestones}} when {{he scored}} his 300th career goal and 600th career point against the Minnesota Wild. He {{was expected to}} play in the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas; however, he missed the game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. The injury kept him out of 12 games in 2006–07. He nevertheless scored 94points, including a career-high 55assists.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} safety Sean Foudy {{left the}} Rough Riders {{as a free}} agent, Allen competed with Hency Charles and Ken Walcott in training camp for the starting role. Allen emerged as the starter in July, but he was sidelined a month later <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} reserve list for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E
50|$|In Week 11 of the 2015 season, Roberts {{returned}} a kick 99 {{yards for a}} touchdown against the Carolina Panthers. On December 21, 2015, he was placed on injured reserve <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>knee</b> injury, ending his season.|$|R

5|$|His {{second game}} came on 17 March 2004 at the Boleyn Ground; he {{replaced}} Clayton Ince after 86 minutes with the score 4–2 to West Ham United, after Ince was stretchered off <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. The eighteen-year-old held his nerve {{in front of}} over 30,000 spectators and no goals were scored in the brief period {{he was on the}} pitch. Later in the year he had a loan spell at local non-league side Stafford Rangers.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013-14 NHL season, Regehr begun his 15th {{year in the}} NHL, {{and played}} his 1,000th game on February 1, 2014, against the Philadelphia Flyers. At the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Regher only played the first round against the San Jose Sharks before being sidelined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. Once the Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, captain Dustin Brown {{finished}} his victory lap by handing the Stanley Cup to Regehr, thanking the veteran for his off-ice presence.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{was given}} more {{opportunities}} at international level in late-2006 during the ODI tour of South Africa, after Yuvraj Singh was sidelined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, and Karthik {{was given a}} spot purely as a batsman following the poor form of Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif. Karthik had opened the batting for Tamil Nadu in the previous season in the Ranji Trophy, {{as well as for}} South Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Playing in three of the ODIs, Karthik himself struggled, with 42 runs at an average of 14.00, and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 50 whitewash.|$|E
50|$|Calf raises are {{sometimes}} done <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flexed <b>knee,</b> usually roughly 90 degrees. This lessens the stretch in the gastrocnemius (<b>a</b> <b>knee</b> flexor), so {{the movement is}} done to emphasize the soleus.|$|R
50|$|As a rookie, Stork started 11 {{regular season}} {{games for the}} Patriots, {{as well as the}} team's two playoff games; he missed the AFC Championship Game <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>knee</b> injury. On February 1, 2015, the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX. Stork became the fifth player ever to win a college {{national}} title and a Super Bowl in back to back years.|$|R
30|$|Borsa et al. [38] {{tried to}} {{determine}} whether performance-based or patient-reported measures of function are more effective at estimating disability in individuals <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> Subjective rating of knee function {{was used as the}} criterion measure for disability, and selected performance-based and patient-reported measures were used as estimation variables. Twenty-nine individuals <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> participated in this investigation. Step-wise regression analysis revealed that the Cincinnati Knee Scale, the Lysholm Knee Scale, and the hop index were the most effective estimates of disability. The results demonstrate that patient-reported measures are more closely related to the patient’s level of disability in individuals <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee.</b> More research is necessary to substantiate these findings.|$|R
5|$|Leeds {{reached the}} semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1986–87, Swan {{played in the}} quarter-final victory over Wigan Athletic, but missed the semi-final defeat to Coventry City at Hillsborough <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. After Leeds posted a fourth-place finish in the league, his {{teammates}} {{then went on to}} lose to Charlton Athletic in the play-off final – Swan missed the game due to his knee injury – this would be as close as Swan would get to reaching the top-flight of English football.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{dropped into}} non-League {{football}} after signing for Conference North club Stafford Rangers {{in the summer}} of 2004. He suffered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury in September 2004 and had an operation in October. His debut came in a 3–2 home victory over Stalybridge Celtic on 14 December 2004, scoring his first goal with the winner in a 1–0 victory away to Moor Green on 19 April 2005. He finished 2004–05 with 23 appearances and one goal for Stafford.|$|E
5|$|Bertuzzi scored {{his first}} goal with the Flames, {{deflecting}} a Dion Phaneuf shot, on October 12, 2008, in a 5-4 overtime {{loss to the}} Vancouver Canucks. While initial fan reaction to Bertuzzi was negative due to his previous role with the division-rival Canucks, {{as well as his}} reputation following the Steve Moore incident, he was eventually accepted in Calgary. In January 2009, he missed five games due to a back injury. Several months later, he was sidelined again <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged cartilage on March 3, 2009. Missing 11 games, he returned in time for the 2009 playoffs, where the Flames were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the opening round. He finished his only season in Calgary with 44 points in 66 regular season games, while adding a goal and an assist in six playoff contests.|$|E
50|$|Torn ligaments is {{the most}} common {{orthopedic}} injury in dogs. Torn crutiate ligaments are seen in most breads but are most common in breeds <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very steep <b>knee</b> position. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> steep <b>knee</b> position, the ligament is much shorter. This will also draw on in rather a rupture occur.|$|R
50|$|Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was the {{defending}} champion, but withdrew <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>knee</b> injury before the tournament began.|$|R
50|$|The season saw {{the return}} of Jerry Rice, who missed most of 1997 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major <b>knee</b> injury.|$|R
5|$|Hackenberg {{was named}} the Big Ten {{freshman}} of the week after totaling 278 passing yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, and Ficken was named Big Ten special teams player of the week, redeeming himself from the 2012 season, after kicking three field goals including a career-long 46-yard kick. Seniors DaQuan Jones and Stephen Obeng-Agyapong led the team defensively with nine tackles, including three for a loss, and a sack at defensive tackle, and eight tackles, a sack, a forced fumble that he recovered, and an interception at safety and linebacker respectively. After {{it was announced that}} Penn State lost senior tight end Matt Lehman for the season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury during the game, O'Brien announced that Obeng-Agyapong might practice with the tight ends to help replace him.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} 1977–78 {{pre-season}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, but recovered {{well enough to}} make 36 appearances throughout the campaign. Kaye was sacked after a poor start to the season, {{and was replaced by}} Bremner's former Leeds teammate Bobby Collins, who had joined the club as assistant manager in the summer; as at Leeds, Bremner had applied for the vacant managerial role, but was rejected. After being turned down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player {{at the end of his}} contract in summer 1978. The season was a disaster, and though Collins was sacked and replaced by youth coach Ken Houghton in February, results did not improve and Hull were relegated in last place, ten points from safety.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, who rushed for 1,182 yards (breaking his own team record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top offense in the NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at Dallas to secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E
50|$|Florida {{finished}} with 632 yards of total offense. LSU quarterback Rohan Davey left the game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hyperextended <b>knee.</b>|$|R
25|$|Starting QB Rex Grossman (2 of 6 for 14 yards) {{left the}} game in the first quarter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>knee</b> injury.|$|R
50|$|After {{missing the}} entire 2014 season <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injured <b>knee,</b> {{on which he}} had two operations, Reed left Glamorgan in September 2014.|$|R
5|$|In June 2011 {{he signed}} a two-year deal with Micky Adams' Port Vale. The League Two club had to pay Hyde a small {{undisclosed}} fee, as the Conference North side secured his contract from their partnership with the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He missed {{the start of the}} 2011–12 season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, and in November 2011 it was revealed {{that he would have to}} undergo surgery to correct the problem. He did not feature in matchday squads for the rest of the season, and was transfer listed in May 2012. The door to the first team remained open though, after Burge had an encouraging and injury-free pre-season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year with the Flames, Glencross set new {{personal}} highs in games played (74), goals (13) and points (40). He missed six games in December 2008 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, and three more early in the 2009–10 NHL season after he was suspended for a blind-side hit on Chris Drury of the New York Rangers. He set a new personal best with 15goals on the season that included his first NHL hat trick in a victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. His season was ended on March 17 after suffering a leg injury when {{he was struck by}} Matt Hendricks of the Colorado Avalanche in a knee-on-knee collision.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{retained}} {{his place}} for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 {{in his first two}} outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading the way as the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress rehearsal for the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury, the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 {{in each of the four}} tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
50|$|Starting QB Rex Grossman (2 of 6 for 14 yards) {{left the}} game in the first quarter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>knee</b> injury.|$|R
5000|$|Hampton faced Duke in {{a first-round}} match-up between two teams {{that did not}} make the tournament last year. The Pirates had a [...] "horrendous" [...] second quarter scoring only two points against the Blue Devils 31. Rebecca Greenwell had <b>a</b> double double <b>with</b> 26 points and 10 rebounds for Duke who went on to win easily 94-31. Duke's Kyra Lambert left the game <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>knee</b> injury in the second quarter and did not return.|$|R
50|$|Edwards was England's captain for the 1995 World Cup tournament, but ruled {{himself out}} of the final against Australia <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{infected}} <b>knee.</b>|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth {{season was}} coached by former UFC Heavyweight {{champion}} Brock Lesnar and Junior dos Santos, {{who would later}} go {{on to win the}} same title. This season featured welterweights and removed the elimination bouts to get into the house, with 14 fighters immediately gaining entry into the house. The first day of training saw Myles Jury pull out of the competition <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. The wildcard made another appearance, with Javier Torres and Chuck O'Neil getting the slots, leading to a submission victory for O'Neil. The final of this season saw Tony Ferguson defeat Ramsey Nijem via KO in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002–03 with 59 {{points and}} again in 2003–04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> injury. Shortly before the 2003-04 season began, Conroy gave up the {{captaincy}} after having {{decided it was time}} for Iginla to take over leadership of the team. He reached two milestones that season; he scored his 300th career point against the Vancouver Canucks on November 29, 2003 and played his 600th game against the Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2004. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs, their first trip to the post-season in eight seasons. Conroy was a key player for the team as they upset the top three seeds in the Western Conference, the Canucks, Red Wings and San Jose Sharks en route to a seventh game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final. He finished second on the team in playoff scoring with 17 points. Following the season, Conroy was named to play with Team USA at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, but appeared in only two games for the team.|$|E
