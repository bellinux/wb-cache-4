When NIS’s format changed, the adaptable <b>wrapper</b> can start recovery phase {{to discover the}} extraction rule of the new format of target NIS. The <b>wrapper</b> can automatically adapt the changes of content tag and accurately extract information. The <b>wrapper</b> is also examined in 6 websites in 3 kind of NIS, and the result shows that the average precision is over 98 %. It can conclude that the generated adaptable <b>wrapper</b> can adapt the NIS’s format changes and accurately extract information...|$|R
5|$|Postal {{stationery}} {{have been}} produced {{in the form of}} registered envelopes, postal cards, envelopes, letter cards, newspaper <b>wrappers,</b> airletters and telegram forms with different designs of impressed stamp applied to show that postage had been pre-paid. Except for limited early usage of previously issued British postal stationery, which were not overprinted like the postage stamps, all post-paid impressed stamps before 1984 were based on variations of a design showing the country's name in Irish, Éire, with appropriate values in text and numeral tablets centred around an Irish harp motif. This was initially superseded by a shamrock design that later became loosely based on the logo of wavy lines and the word POST used by An Post from 1984. An Post has also used some designs based on postage stamps as post-paid impressed stamps on Irish postal stationery.|$|E

GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as {{the best choice for}} writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using <b>wrappers.</b>|$|E
