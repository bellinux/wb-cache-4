Before hauling Snake away, Chief Wiggum points out that Apu, Moe, and Bart are all witnesses; Snake vows to kill them all. After the execution, Homer visits Dr. Nick, who transplants Snake's hair onto Homer's head. When Homer goes to sleep the following night, it plants its roots in Homer's brain. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> controlling his mind, Homer murders Apu and Moe. Bart realizes that the other two witnesses have been killed, and Homer vows to protect him. Homer locks himself and Bart in a room, but Snake's hair takes control of him. Homer tries to kill Bart with a sledgehammer. Bart begs Homer to fight the hair and, after a struggle, Homer rips the hair off his head. Wiggum bursts in and shoots the hair dead.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{index of}} hair bending stiffness is calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index differs by race. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>hair</b> stiffness index value of 4.23 have <b>the</b> most rigid <b>hair</b> and Europeans <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>hair</b> stiffness index value of 1.59 have <b>the</b> least rigid <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> eccentricity of <b>hair</b> cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>hair</b> eccentricity index value of 1.74 have <b>the</b> curliest <b>hair</b> and Mongoloids <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>hair</b> eccentricity index value of 1.30 have <b>the</b> least curly <b>hair.</b>|$|R

Dainichi Nyorai's hands make a characteristic mudra (the fingers {{of his left hand}} hold his right hand's index, see photo). Excepted Dainichi Nyorai, who is represented with some body ornamentation like a bodhisattva, all statues wear just a simple robe without body ornamentation, signs of priesthood. This is because they represent someone who has reached enlightenment. The robe can cover one or both shoulders. The head has a round protuberance on top <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> divided in tight curls. Both features are exclusive characteristics of this rank, but the curls can be missing.|$|E

25|$|After {{losing the}} trios title Black Warrior {{had a hard}} time finding any direction, at one point he {{publicly}} pleaded with CMLL to turn him rudo via an interview for Box y Lucha magazine. In early 2006 Warrior began working with Místico and the two quickly earned a shot at the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, held by Averno and Mephisto. During the third fall of the match Místico accidentally collided with Black Warrior causing their team to lose. Weeks later, during a rematch, Black Warrior turned on Místico, attacking him during the match and then walking out. The storyline with Místico was further intensified when Black Warrior defeated Místico for the NWA World Middleweight Championship on May 12, 2006. After months of scripted hostility between Warrior and Místico the two faced off in a Luchas de Apuestas (bet fight), mask versus mask match at CMLL's 73rd Anniversary show. The match saw Místico defeat Black Warrior, two falls to one, to win Black Warrior's mask. For {{the first time in his}} career Warrior was forced to unmask and show his face in public. Following the loss of his mask Black Warrior made several successful title defenses against Místico until finally losing the NWA World Middleweight Title back to him on April 29, 2007. After the feud with Místico ended Black Warrior worked as an upper-card rudo although not with any major storylines. In late 2007 Black Warrior became involved in a storyline that saw Warrior and Rey Bucanero team up to take on Shocker and Lizmark Jr. in a tag team Luchas de Apuestas <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of the losing team on the line. On December 7, 2007 Warrior and Bucanero lost and had their heads shaved completely bald as a result of the stipulation, in the main event of CMLL's pay-per-view Sin Piedad (Without Mercy).|$|E
500|$|Sheridan's {{performance}} was generally well received. Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker {{wrote that the}} best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a [...] "grim intensity". He commented that Sheridan had [...] "leading-man looks" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of a [...] "dissolute heavy metal star", making him [...] "unsettling" [...] even when not wearing makeup that makes {{him look like a}} devil. Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan might have been a bit young and [...] "zany" [...] for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role [...] "with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)".|$|E

In five-gaited competition, they are shown with a full tail, often augmented with an artificial switch, and a full mane. Three-gaited horses are shown with a shaved off [...] "roached" [...] mane and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{at the top of}} their tails, an area called the dock, trimmed short. [...] While use of a set tail in certain types of competition was common, today, tailsets are generally not allowed on the show grounds, except for horses in the Park Pleasure division, and horses with unset tails are not penalized in any division. Gingering is prohibited.|$|E

During the performance, she changed the lyrics to fit the occasion: [...] "With your high cowboy boots on. Oh Sugarland, it's been six whole years." [...] According to James Montgomery of MTV News, she performed a [...] "husky, musky version" [...] of [...] "You and I". She performed the song on her 2012 Born This Way Ball tour by playing it on the piano before running around the stage.

500|$|After {{the defeat}} of Pope at Second Bull Run, President Lincoln reluctantly {{returned}} {{to the man who}} had mended a broken army before. He realized that McClellan was a strong organizer and a skilled trainer of troops, able to recombine the units of Pope's army with the Army of the Potomac faster than anyone. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to command [...] "the fortifications of Washington, and all the troops for the defense of the capital." [...] The appointment was controversial in the Cabinet, a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to the president [...] "our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States." [...] The president admitted that it was like [...] "curing the bite <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of the dog." [...] But Lincoln told his secretary, John Hay, [...] "We must use what tools we have. There is no man in the Army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he. If he can't fight himself, he excels in making others ready to fight." ...|$|E
500|$|Karen Hartley-Thomas was {{the hair}} and make-up {{designer}} for the production. She began prepping {{a couple of months}} before filming began, and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film. Like the costumers, she read books and went to art galleries during her research. The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a [...] "no make-up look" [...] because in the time period in which the film is set, only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make-up. The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush. Hartley-Thomas also used very little make-up on the men, as she does not like them looking made up. Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said [...] "Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she has lots of different looks and lots of wild looks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> loose." [...] She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered. John Dashwood and his son were given red hair, as Hartley-Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E
