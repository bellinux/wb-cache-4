5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945.

This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E
5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft.

The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower.
