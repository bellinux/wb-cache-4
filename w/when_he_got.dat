5|$|In December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, {{a chemist}} and {{director}} of research at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as the deputy chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for propellants, explosives and the like. Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, a member of the NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University {{and the chairman of the}} NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the wartime Manhattan Project responsible for building an atomic bomb. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there, Thomas found Conant was also present.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E

Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors.

Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
5|$|Jamie McMurray {{took the}} lead by the 53rd lap, when a third caution was {{deployed}} after Reutimann's right-rear tire blew on the backstretch, causing Gordon to take evasive action by turning right and heavily damaged the nose of his car when he collided with the outside wall. Reutimann's tire broke Johnson's front splitter brace. All drivers, including McMurray, chose to make pit stops. Vickers elected {{to stay on the}} track and led the field at the restart on lap 58, ahead of Kvapil and Skinner. Two laps later, Hamlin used the draft to take over the lead, with Labonte moving into second. Kahne used the outside lane to claim first position, before Reed Sorenson also drove on the outside lane to claim first place on the next lap. The pack drove three abreast on lap 63, as Truex moved into first place on the 64th lap. McMurray reclaimed the first position <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> ahead of Truex at the start-finish line on lap 65, and Kahne dropped to 26th position by the same lap.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Barrett {{made headlines}} again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{into a fight}} with teammate Carlos Zambrano. During {{a game against the}} Atlanta Braves on June 1, 2007, tensions began to rise between the two players when the Cubs allowed the Braves to score five runs in the fifth inning. The Braves recorded 20 hits, en route to winning 8-5. However, their productivity became overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett. As the two returned to the dugout, they had an exchange of words, which escalated into a small fight. After Lou Piniella dismissed the two from the game, another fight ensued within the Cubs’ clubhouse, and Zambrano punched Barrett's lip. The wound required Barrett {{to go to the hospital}} immediately and receive stitches. Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after the ordeal, and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences. Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money.|$|E
