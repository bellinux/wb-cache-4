Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the <b>lock</b> <b>wire,</b> the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from bolt threads and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert. As the bolt is torqued into the insert the bolt threads its way past the crimped parts of the insert. This provides the locking of the bolt, as torque is required to loosen the joint after clamping...|$|R

50|$|The Surface Book's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by a goal to design a 2-in-1 convertible tablet that could be folded like a laptop, and not require the keyboard to be heavier than the tablet portion {{in order to support}} and balance the tablet portion.

The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the <b>wire</b> <b>lock</b> pin attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the release loads and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three bracket attachment designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the connection between the brackets and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory release loads.

Since the grenade was an offensive type, designers didn't want to have a heavy part of the bomb flying far away from the intended point of detonation, an possibly injuring the thrower.

50|$|The basic {{construction}} method {{begins by}} digging a trench down to undisturbed mineral subsoil. Rows of woven bags (or tubes) {{are filled with}} available material, placed into this trench, compacted with a pounder to around 1/3 thickness of pre-pounded thickness, and form a foundation. Each successive layer will have one or more strands of barbed wire placed on top. This digs into the bag's weave and prevents slippage of subsequent layers, and also resists any tendency for the outward expansion of walls. The next row of bags is offset by half a bag's width to form a staggered pattern. These are either pre-filled with material and delivered, or filled in place (often the case with Superadobe). The weight of this earth-filled bag pushes down on the barbed <b>wire</b> strands, <b>locking</b> the bag in place on the row below. The same process continues layer upon layer, forming walls.

To bring the Town Car into the 1990s, many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely. Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline, the flat-sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late 1960s disappeared. In their quest to give the Town Car a more aerodynamic body than its predecessor, stylists trimming its drag coefficient from 0.46 to 0.36 (matching the 1988 Continental and besting the Mark VII).

Although two-tone paint remained available (featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic), monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard.

40|$|Background: In high-income countries, 6 % of {{all women}} will have {{sustained}} a fracture of the wrist (distal radius) {{by the age of}} 80 years and 9 % by the age of 90 years. Advances in orthopaedic surgery have improved the outcome for patients: many such fractures can be treated in a plaster cast alone, but others require surgical fixation to hold the bone in place while they heal. The existing evidence suggests that modern locking-plate fixation provides improved functional outcomes, but costs more than traditional wire fixation. Methods: In this multicentre trial, we randomly assigned 461 adult patients having surgery for an acute dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius to either percutaneous Kirschner-wire fixation or locking-plate fixation. The primary outcome measure was the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation © (PRWE) questionnaire at 12 months after the fracture. In this surgical trial, neither the patients nor the surgeons could be blind to the intervention. We also collected information on complications and combined costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to assess cost-effectiveness. Results: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced and over 90 % of patients completed follow-up. Both groups of patients recovered wrist function by 12 months. There was no clinically relevant difference in the PRWE questionnaire score at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months [difference at 12 months: – 1. 3; 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 4. 5 to 1. 8; p = 0. 398]. There was no difference in the number of complications in each group and small differences in QALY gains (0. 008; 95 % CI – 0. 001 to 0. 018); Kirschner-wire fixation represents a cost-saving intervention (–£ 727; 95 % CI –£ 588 to –£ 865), particularly in younger patients.
