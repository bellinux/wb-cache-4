5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open the line to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents. Oslo Sporveier, the operator, turned down the proposals, arguing that it <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> 3billion NOK to lay the tracks and put up overhead line equipment, {{and that it would}} not attract enough passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not convinced that it would be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, after only 16 years in operation, and ten of the wagons were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} to develop modern {{successor}} to the Swedish , that <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> 1/3 of the German Type 214.It was initially planned that the Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian navies would purchase two, four, and four Viking-class submarines each starting in 2005.|$|R
5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised {{design for the}} ship that reflected the lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add anti-torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato, although it <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsus completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.|$|E

25|$|Indian {{government}} {{in collaboration with}} Japan will build India's first high-speed railway. The planned rail would run some 500 km (310 mi) between Mumbai and the western city of Ahmedabad, at {{a top speed of}} 320 km/h (200 mph). Under the proposal, construction is expected to begin in 2017 and be completed in 2022. It <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> ₹1100 billion (US$17 billion) and be financed by a low-interest loan from Japan.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2006, Aston Martin {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} offer the V8 Vantage N24 to customers as a track car similar to a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup. In contrast to Porsche—his former employer—Bez announced that Aston Martin would not extract a premium for the track model; stripped for competition, the limited-production N24 <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> {{as much as a}} regular V8 Vantage. The N24 specification complies with FIA GT4 European Cup, German VLN series, Grand-Am Cup, and various other national series' requirements.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in {{response}} {{to the fact that the}} landslides of Hatlestad and Hetlebakken proved rescue routines after landslides to be unsafe and ineffective, the municipality would establish a 24-man special rescue group to respond to disasters caused by extreme weather. Helge Eidsnes and Tore Kallekleiv of the rescue group voiced budget concerns, stating that recruiting and equipping men for the team <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> 500 000 NOK (approx. 82 000 USD as of June 2007), which according to him was a large amount to the unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{display is}} the most {{expensive}} component in most laptops. In April 2005, Negroponte hired Mary Lou Jepsen—who was interviewing to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2008—as OLPC Chief Technology Officer. Jepsen developed a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, inspired by the design of small LCDs used in portable DVD players, which she estimated <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> $35. In the OLPC XO-1, the screen is estimated to be the second most expensive component (after the CPU and chipset).|$|E
25|$|In July 2017, the Austria Defense Ministry {{announced}} that it would be replacing all of its Typhoon aircraft by 2020. The ministry said that continued use of its Typhoons over their 30-year life–span <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> €5 billion with the bulk being for maintenance. It estimated that buying a new fleet of 15 single–seat and 3 twin–seat fighters would save €2 billion over that period. Austria plans to explore a government-to-government sale or lease agreement to avoid a lengthy and costly tender process with a manufacturer. Possible replacements include the Saab Gripen and the F-16.|$|E

25|$|The Gateway Program is {{the planned}} phased {{expansion}} and {{renovation of the}} Northeast Corridor (NEC) rail line between Newark, New Jersey, and New York City, New York. The proposed project <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> 20 billion dollars and would be completed in 2026. Once completed the improvements would double train capacity (25 extra trains per hour) and would allow for additional high-speed rail service. The existing two-track rail line used by both Amtrak (AMTK) and New Jersey Transit (NJT) has reached full capacity. Its original tunnels and bridges were built over 100 years ago and suffered major damage during Hurricane Sandy.|$|E
25|$|Combined, {{the pension}} {{and health care}} reforms the MTA sought <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> US$30 million over the span of the three-year contract. Critics lambasted both the MTA and TWU for {{allowing}} a strike to occur over such a relatively small sum. However, the pension costs would balloon to US$160 {{million in the first}} 10 years, and US$80 million per year after 20 years. The MTA said that its reluctance to give in to the TWU on this point stems from fear of future deficits (projected to be 1 billion USD by 2009), although critics contend that its assertion of deficits in early 2005 was fabricated to justify fare hikes. The 2012 MTA budget maintained a $68 million deficit.|$|E
50|$|The new {{recreation}} areas cost {{at least}} $150 million, paid for entirely by New York City taxpayers.

25|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Bulletin Reports, the Russian Navy expected to buy the Mikoyan MiG-29K aircraft for Admiral Kuznetsov by 2011; this intent was confirmed by the general designer {{of one of the}} defence enterprises which produces sub-assemblies for these aircraft. These would replace the 19 carrier-based Su-33 fighters, a resource set to expire by 2015. Producing more Su-33s is possible but not cost-effective for such small volumes; the MiG-29K is more convenient as the Indian Navy placed an order a total for 45, reducing development and manufacture costs. India paid $730 million for the development and delivery of 16 MiG-29Ks; 24 more for the Russian Navy <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> <b>about</b> $1 billion.|$|E
