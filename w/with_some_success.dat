50|$|The economy within Torres Novas {{continued}} {{along the}} 19th century, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>successes</b> and failures: {{the founding of}} the Fábrica de Papel do Almonda (1818); establishment of the Companhia de Fiação de Torres Novas (1845); the creation of the transporter João Clara & Companhia (Irmãos) Lda. which, {{at the time of its}} nationalization (1975), was domianted by Clara Transportes - S.A.R.L..|$|R
5|$|In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski {{defeated}} the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river, {{and forced the}} Austrians to retreat from occupied Warsaw. Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered {{by the presence of}} Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and that did not allow them to advance. Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E
5|$|The usual call is {{an eerie}} high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow... kee-ow... kee-ow, made while flying or roosting, {{and can be}} heard from afar. Birds may also make a harsh {{screeching}} alarm call. They also make a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E

5|$|Edwin Lloyd St Hill (9 March 1904– 21 May 1957) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} two Test matches for the West Indies in 1930. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl, also played for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for the West Indies. St Hill first played local cricket in Trinidad <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success</b> and {{graduated}} to the Trinidad team. He played regularly {{for the next}} five years but was not selected for any representative West Indian teams. His increased success in 1929 attracted the attention of the West Indies selectors, and he played two Test matches against England in 1930. Although not particularly successful, he bowled steadily and was chosen to tour Australia with the West Indies in 1930–31. He was fairly effective in first-class games but the form of the other fast bowlers in the team meant that he was not chosen for any of the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Cisneros Carrillo {{was born}} on August 25, 1932, son of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz Isabel Carrillo Iñiguez in the Lagunero town of Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. While in school Cisneros met and befriended José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal, a {{friendship}} that was close that they considered each other's brothers. The friendship between the two {{was so strong that}} Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym where Cisnero met <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success</b> as a Golden Gloves boxer. Cisnero was also an avid cyclist, having participated in the first ever Vuelta Coahula bicycle race. Late in life he credited training as a boxer and cyclist for his stamina in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.|$|E

From the bases at Falam and Hakha, Khan's forces sent out forward patrols and laid ambushes, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>successes,</b> for the Chin guerrillas under the command of a British officer, taking a number of prisoners. In the middle of May, a force under Khan's Adjutant, Mahboob [...] "Boobie" [...] Ahmed, attacked and captured the hilltop fortress of Klang Klang.|$|R

5|$|Locust plagues {{can have}} devastating effects on human {{population}}s, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned {{in both the}} Koran and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax {{for at least two}} years under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{attacked}} {{in the east}} <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> taking Verrières village itself, but were repulsed at Tilly-la-Campagne by German counterattacks. The 5th Brigade, in the centre, made a bid for Fontenay-le-Marmion; of the 325 members of the Black Watch who left the start-lines, only 15 answered evening roll-call. German counterattacks on 26 and 27July pushed Canadian forces back to Point 67. However, the situation eventually eased for the 2nd Canadian Division when US forces went on the offensive. Throughout {{the first week of}} August, significant German resources were transferred from the Anglo-Canadian front to that of the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant General George Patton, while reinforcements moved from Pas de Calais to the Falaise–Calvados area. By 7August 1944, only one major formation—the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend—faced Canadian forces on Verrières Ridge.|$|E

5|$|The castle is classed as a Grade I listed {{building}} and a Scheduled monument. The site, managed by English Heritage, {{is open to}} the public. Until the 1970s, the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official histories of the castle; early official guides to the castle made no reference to it. In 1978, however, the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford's Tower, and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower. Recently, commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it. Citizens, visitors, academics, environmentalists, local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> winning a lengthy and bitter public inquiry in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{successes of}} Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav partisans in Dalmatia led the Allies to {{despatch}} small patrols into Yugoslavia and Albania to contact partisan leaders and arrange co-operation with the Allied air forces. Several Rhodesian patrols from the LRDG {{were selected to}} undertake such missions during August and September 1944. Yugoslav partisans subsequently indicated targets for Allied bombing missions, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success.</b> From September, members of the LRDG's Rhodesian squadron under Captain Olivey undertook advanced reconnaissance in the Peloponnese peninsula of southern Greece. Landing at Katakolo, {{they made their way}} inland to Corinth and, along with the British 4th Parachute Battalion, entered Athens as the Germans departed in November. The Rhodesians of the LRDG spent November and December helping Greek forces to garrison an Athens orphanage against supporters of the communist Greek People's Liberation Army. Four Rhodesians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.cuneata include land clearing, {{which leads}} to direct plant loss and {{population}} fragmentation, grazing pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the fire regime, and encroaching salinity. The Banksia Atlas survey found one population {{to be on the}} side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A large part of the surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> helped with watering in the first year.|$|E

5|$|After {{establishing}} an early {{reputation as a}} prolific schoolboy batsman, Jardine played cricket for Winchester College, attended the University of Oxford, playing for its cricket team, and played for Surrey County Cricket Club as an amateur. He developed a defensive method of batting which was unusual for an amateur, receiving occasional criticism for negative batting. Despite this, Jardine was selected in Test matches {{for the first time}} in 1928, and went on to play <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success</b> in the Test series in Australia in 1928–29. Following this tour, his business commitments prevented him from playing as much cricket. However, in 1931, he was asked to captain England in a Test against New Zealand. Although there were some initial misgivings about his captaincy, Jardine led England in the next three cricket seasons and on two overseas tours, one of which was the Australian tour of 1932–33. Of his 15 Tests as captain, he won nine, lost one and drew five. He retired from all first-class cricket in 1934 following a tour to India.|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success.</b> On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to unmask and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as a surprise that he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a sign that the promotion has plans to move a wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match but the fact that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E
5|$|King Richard I of England {{had been}} {{captured}} and imprisoned by Leopold of Austria on the King's return from crusade in December 1192. For over a year, the terms of his release were negotiated, until he was released on payment of a massive ransom in January 1194. Whilst he was imprisoned, Richard's brother, John, had allied against Richard with the French King, Philip II, who had also wanted to capture the English king. John had granted Philip much land from Richard's estates in Aquitaine. As well as various castles, this included {{the whole of the}} duchy lands east of the River Seine. During Richard's imprisonment, Philip had made attempts at physically occupying these estates, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>success,</b> particularly around the important Channel ports of Dieppe and Le Tréport. However, as soon as Richard returned to Normandy, John made his peace with him, abandoning Philip; Richard proceeded to unravel much of Philip's recent gains in the region, beginning with the raising of Philip's siege of Verneuil on 29 May 1194. There, Philip was forced into a hasty retreat, and, foreshadowing his losses at Fréteval, abandoned his siege engines and other valuable matériel.|$|E
