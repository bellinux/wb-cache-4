500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E

In an interview in the mid-1990s, she appeared happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. [...] "I've always tried to remember <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> used to tell me", she said. [...] "Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won't hurt so much." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was in this}} humble {{fashion that}} I brought to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> the new {{daughter}} for whom she had longed, {{and it was in}} this homely way that the Garlands and McClintocks received my wife. Amid surroundings which were without grace of art or touch of poetry, the informal and very plain ceremony took place, but the words were sincere, and the forms and features of the speakers deeply significant of the past. No matter <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> storms and sorrows had been, she was now at peace. With a smiling face she confronted the future.|$|R
