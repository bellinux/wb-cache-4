On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans; of these, only Vernon Baker <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E

Bormann's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, insisted that he saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946. In case Bormann <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive,</b> multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on the radio in October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Beswick {{was born}} in 1688, the {{daughter}} of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E
5|$|Joachim III was enthroned in the {{beginning}} of the rule of emperor George Terter I (r. 1280–1292). However, soon after that Joachim III refused to acknowledge the emperor's second marriage to Kira Maria because his first wife Maria Terter <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> After George Terter divorced Maria in 1279 he sent her and his first born son Theodore Svetoslav as hostages to the Byzantine Empire. The Patriarch refused to allow George Terter I to the church sacraments until he conceded to abandon Kira Maria and remarry his first wife, after he secured her return from Byzantine captivity in 1282.|$|E

5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican {{government}} {{reported that}} Moreno González was killed during a two-day gunfight with the Mexican federal police {{in his home}} state in December 2010. After the shootout, however, no body was recovered. Rumors thus persisted that Moreno González <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the split-off group of La Familia Michoacana. Four years later, on 9 March 2014, his survival was confirmed. Mexican authorities located him again, this time in the town of Tumbiscatío, Michoacán, and attempted to apprehend him. A gunfight ensued resulting in Moreno González's death. Subsequent forensic examination confirmed his identity.|$|E
5|$|The element {{seaborgium}} {{was named}} after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive,</b> which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in Discover magazine's review {{of the year in}} science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{claimed to}} have {{information}} that placed Mengele in several locations: on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, the latter eighteen years after he had left. In 1982, he offered a reward of $100,000 for Mengele's capture and insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> The Mengele family admitted to authorities in 1985 that he had died in 1979; the body was exhumed and its identity was confirmed. Earlier that year Wiesenthal had served {{as one of the}} judges at a mock trial of Mengele, held in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive,</b> forgot where she was, and suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
