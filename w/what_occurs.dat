The purpose and problem of the study were to compare perceptions held by superintendents, principals, and school board presidents and differences in perceptions within and across roles on <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on four critical issues in AIDS education for healthy children in K- 12 public schools in Illinois: school responsibility, program development, program delivery and evaluation, and instruction, content, and materials. An author-developed survey instrument containing 65 items on critical issues in AIDS education and 11 items on districts and respondents was sent to 600 randomly selected superintendents, principals, and school board presidents. Two hundred usable responses (33 %) were received. Respondents rated their perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in their districts on two Likert-type scales. The results of this study indicate the following. (1) Superintendents, principals, and school board presidents do not differ significantly in their perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on critical issues in AIDS education for healthy children. (2) Each group perceives a significant difference between <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> in their school districts and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in AIDS education programs. (3) There are no significant differences in perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on critical issues in AIDS education across the three roles of superintendent, principal, and school board president. (4) There are significant differences in the <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> responses when analyzed by per pupil expenditure and significant differences between the <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> responses when analyzed by per pupil expenditure, student enrollment, and percentage of students at risk. The study has important implications for: (1) development, planning, implementation, and evaluation of AIDS education programs for healthy children; (2) further research to examine possible discrepancies between <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in AIDS education programs as perceived by administrators and other education professionals; and (3) educational policy...|$|R

25|$|In {{practice}} one constructs an estimator as {{a function}} of an available sample of size n, and then imagines being able to keep collecting data and expanding the sample ad infinitum. In this way one would obtain a sequence of estimates indexed by n, and consistency is a property of <b>what</b> <b>occurs</b> as the sample size “grows to infinity”. If the sequence of estimates can be mathematically shown to converge in probability to the true value θ0, it is called a consistent estimator; otherwise the estimator is said to be inconsistent.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by <b>what</b> <b>occurs</b> under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly <b>what</b> <b>occurs,</b> though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on March 3, 1911. The Billboards reviewer gave a positive review and asserted, [...] "Any motion picture in which the views of 'back on the stage' are shown possesses {{a certain degree of}} interest. The ever-curious public is fascinated by the alluring stories of the stage world, and any peep it is given into this realm is welcomed. Because of this, Stage Struck derives the interest it has. As far as the story is concerned there is no special recommendation for it. ... The theatre settings are about as faithful depictions of stage scenes as are found in motion pictures. The player portraying the role of the leading actor very much exaggerates in makeup. The photography is very good." [...] Both the The Morning Telegraph and The New York Dramatic Mirror thought the conclusion was impossible turn of events. The Telegraphs reviewer wrote, [...] "An excellent opportunity was sadly missed for the exposition of a strong lesson to the uninitiated girl or boy who dreams of a career before the footlights. How any author or producer could permit such an impossible ending is a wonder. Can any sensible person imagine a New York manager offering an inexperienced amateur a leading part in a Broadway production? Yet this is <b>what</b> <b>occurs</b> in this tale of a stage-struck miss who joins a repertoire company, is stranded, gets home through the generosity of a traveling salesman and then, with no lapse of time or experience noted, receives a letter with such an offer! Most of the play was well put on and ably acted. The 'star' of the theatrical company wore an abominable wig, which could be distinguished as false. More care and thought would have made this an admirable offering." [...] The Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "The production leaves the impression of being exceedingly well done, but to the average actor the New York engagement, after forsaking her barnstorming company of players, seems somewhat of a dream. It was also startling to see her playing Ophelia after such a flat failure at the previous rehearsal where another took her place." [...] According to the synopsis, it is likely that this New York production in which she foresees herself on stage as Ophelia is a dream because it is prompted by the two letters she received at home.|$|E
