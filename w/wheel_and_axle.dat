5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> <b>axle</b> (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Chinese {{historical}} {{text of the}} Sanguozhi (Records of the Three Kingdoms), {{compiled by}} the ancient historian Chen Shou (233297 CE), credits {{the invention of the}} wheelbarrow to Prime Minister Zhuge Liang (181234 CE) of Shu Han from 197234. It was written that in 231 CE, Zhuge Liang developed the vehicle of the wooden ox and used it as a transport for military supplies in a campaign against Cao Wei. Further annotations of the text by Pei Songzhi (430 CE) described the design in detail as a large single central <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> <b>axle</b> around which a wooden frame was constructed in representation of an ox. Writing later in the 11th century, the Song Dynasty (9601279) scholar Gao Cheng wrote that the small wheelbarrow of his day, with shafts pointing forward (so that it was pulled), was the direct descendent of Zhuge Liang's wooden ox. Furthermore, he pointed out that the 3rd century 'gliding horse' wheelbarrow featured the simple difference of the shaft pointing backwards (so that it was pushed instead).|$|E

2500|$|Rotaxane-based {{molecular}} machines {{have been}} of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular shuttles. These molecular machines are usually based on {{the movement of the}} macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> <b>axle</b> or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a molecular switch, with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [...] and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles. In 2009, there was a report of a [...] "domino effect" [...] from one extremity to the other in a Glycorotaxane Molecular Machine. In this case, the 4C1 or 1C4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.|$|E
