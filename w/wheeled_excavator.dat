40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} {{model for the}} prediction of soil-tool interaction forces, based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is presented. Three different types of particle-interaction laws for cohesionless, cohesive, and cemented soil are described. The shear strength of the soil is being calibrated {{by the use of}} simulated triaxial compression tests. Other parameters of the model are either chosen by experience or by the use of dimensionless numbers. Laboratory tests on a straight cutting blade, which is moved through the sample soil at constant speed, show good agreement with the results of the simulation. For this case, empirical formulas based on the passive earth pressure could be applied. Beyond that, the particle simulation can also be applied in the same manner to more complex tool geometries and trajectories.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{the issues of the}} {{formation}} and use of costings within the corporate practice. The aim is to create final costings of a selected cost unit (one hour of work of a <b>wheeled</b> <b>excavator)</b> and to evaluate the cost effectiveness and its profitability for the company. The theoretical section of the work focuses on basic terminology and it treats the importance of costings, classification of costs, types of costings, the methods of evaluation of effectiveness and the possible role of the costings within the analysis of the break-even point. The actual costing was compiled in the form of absorption (full) and variable costs. The work is based on the billed items of the costs which were all transferred to the direct and indirect costs. For the allocation of general management and administration costs and the manufacturing costs, the natural allocation basis worked hours was chosen. The obtained data provided the basis for the evaluation of the profitability of the product and for the calculation of the profit in the absolute amount with regard to different prices for one hour of work. The main result of the research was that the amount charged for the product does not reach its complete output expenses. Using the analysis of break-event point, we specified the volumes of output and its prices needed so that the product could make a profit...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the report}} Ergonomic on-Site Assessment of Excavator Work, one big problem is the risk of falling {{accidents}} when entering and exiting the cab. The solution could be lowering the cab {{to the ground in}} front of the machine, this could also help during cleaning of windows. The mechanism needed for this operation could also be used for adjusting the cabin in height and tilting it, in order to solve the problem with neck and back injuries. In Umeå I had a meeting with professor Ivan Westerlund at SLU (Swedish Agricultural University) who taught me about ways to reduce vibrations by different undercarriages. It would be possible to have a principle similar to the terrain vehicles and tanks produced by Hägglunds. They are equipped with an active suspension system, making it possible to drive in high speed with track-undercarriage. By using this techniqe it would be possible to merge the two different excavators into one, a stable machine while working and a comfortable fast machine during transport. A fuelcell powerplant would be well suited, considering sound level and pollution in urban environment and especially underground worksituations. With less need for maintenance the risk for falling accidents gets minimized. As a bonus, maybe the waste water could be used for spraying, to avoid dust when needed. Today´s underground-operating machines are tied up with a waterhose which affects the mobility to a high level.

40|$|An {{essential}} element when establishing {{the balance of}} a bucket <b>wheel</b> <b>excavator</b> is {{the determination of the}} barycentre, the best results being thus obtained by weighting after having installed all the components. The lack of correct balance for bucket <b>wheel</b> <b>excavators</b> determines their operation in an inadequate dynamic mode, or in extreme cases, there is the danger of losing stability by tilting over the excavator respectively suffering huge material and human loss. It is compulsory to verify for the correctness of the position and mass value of balance because there might be substantial error sources leading to compromise the operation. One of the most popular methods is that of weighting the entire equipment from the superior platform of the excavator. The weighting process implies the lifting of the excavators in three spots with hydraulic cylinders, the measurement of the forces, as well as the measurement of pressure inside the cylinders and of the stroke of each cylinder. The data measurement and rehashing installation is destined to determine the dimensions that finally define the weighting process of excavators or other operating machineries to which the balancing and control of stability is imposed...|$|R
