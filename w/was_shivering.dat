500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody <b>was</b> <b>shivering,</b> and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 9, 710, Li Chongfu {{arrived at}} Luoyang {{and took over}} Pei's mansion, and the {{officials}} at Luoyang, surprised, largely began to flee. Li Chongfu began {{to try to take}} command of the imperial troops in Luoyang, but the official Li Yong (李邕) persuaded the imperial guards to reject Li Chongfu, and when Li Chongfu arrived at imperial guards' camps, they fired arrows at him. His attacks on the governmental offices were also repelled. He thereafter fled and tried to hide, but the next day, with troops closing in on his position, he jumped into a canal and drowned. Zheng tried to flee by putting on women's clothes and changing his hair style into a woman's hairstyle, but was nevertheless captured. When both he and Zhang were interrogated, he was so fearful that he <b>was</b> <b>shivering</b> and unable to answer any questions. Zhang, who answered questions normally, commented as he looked on Zheng, [...] "I deserve defeat for starting a rebellion with this kind of a man." [...] Both Zheng and Zhang were taken to a busy marketplace and beheaded in public.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} his {{execution}}, 30 January 1649, Charles {{dressed in}} two shirts so that he would not shiver from the cold, in case it was said that he <b>was</b> <b>shivering</b> from fear. His execution was delayed by several hours so that the House of Commons could pass an emergency bill to make it an offence to proclaim a new King, and to declare the representatives of the people, the House of Commons, as the source of all just power. Charles was then escorted through the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall to a scaffold where he would be beheaded. He forgave those who had passed sentence on him and gave instructions to his enemies that they should learn to [...] "know their duty to God, the King - that is, my successors - and the people". He then gave a brief speech outlining his unchanged views {{of the relationship between the}} monarchy and the monarch's subjects, ending with the words [...] "I am the martyr of the people".
