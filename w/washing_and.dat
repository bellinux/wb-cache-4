5|$|Respectable Athenian women {{remained}} {{separate from}} unrelated men and Athenian citizens considered it degrading for citizen-women to work, but women (free and unfree) are attested as {{working in a}} number of capacities. Women engaged in occupations which were an extension of household jobs, such as textile work and <b>washing,</b> <b>and</b> those unrelated to household tasks: cobblers, gilders, net-weavers, potters, and grooms.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>Wash</b> <b>and</b> Set is a {{term used}} {{commonly}} within the hair industry in order to describe a service performed on the hair.

5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there. The women were initially held in the hospital building, and then in their own walled-off section of the prison, with cells in the kitchen and wash house buildings. The women were tasked with <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> mending prisoners' clothing, which was considered hard work.|$|E

5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{began his}} stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935â€“1978, had previously experimented with <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E
50|$|In August 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{unveiled}} a global strategy and action plan to integrate WASH with other public health interventions {{in order to}} accelerate elimination of NTDs. The plan aims to intensify control or eliminate certain NTDs in specific regions by 2020. It refers to the NTD roadmap milestones that included for example eradication of dracunculiasis by 2015 and of yaws by 2020, elimination of trachoma and lymphatic filariasis as public health problems by 2020, intensified control of dengue, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases. The plan consists of four strategic objectives: Improving awareness of benefits of joint <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD actions; monitoring <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD actions to track progress; strengthening evidence of how to deliver effective <b>WASH</b> interventions; <b>and</b> planning, delivering <b>and</b> evaluating <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD programmes with involvement of all stakeholders. The aim is to use synergies between <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD programmes.|$|R

5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous <b>washing,</b> <b>and</b> with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
