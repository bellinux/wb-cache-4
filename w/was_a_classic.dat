5|$|The game Donner–Tal, Zurich 1959, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> {{demonstration}} {{of the power of}} Black's queenside pawn advance, backed up by the bishop on g7. After Black's 20...Qb4! White was unable to exchange queens, as 21.Qxb4 cxb4 22.Nd1 Nc5 would fork the pawns on a4 and e4. However, the actual game did not last long after Donner's 21.Qf1: Tal set his pawns in motion with 21...c4 22.Re2 b5 23.axb5 axb5 24.Kh1, created a passed c-pawn with 24...Bxc3! 25.bxc3 Qxc3 26.Rxb5 Qd3 27.Qe1 c3 28.Rb1, and forced Donner's resignation with 28...Nc5! when White could neither save his e-pawn nor stop Black's c-pawn from queening. According to Donner, while he spent over two hours on the game, Tal used only fifteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the Namibian War of Independence began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) {{military}} wing – the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in Zambia. The first attack was the battle at Omugulugwombashe on 26 August, and the war <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> insurgent-counterinsurgent operation. PLAN initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later {{forced out of the}} country by the South African Defence Force (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia. The intensity of cross-border conflict escalated, becoming known as the South African Border War and the Angolan Bush War.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> Cape Verde {{hurricane}} {{that had}} substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane {{of the active}} 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

25|$|Hanley {{was often}} criticized for his union's {{close ties to}} {{organized}} crime. In 1977, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) said HERE <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of organized crime's control over a major labor union. DOJ also alleged that Hanley's election {{as president of the}} union was assisted by Chicago crime boss Joey Aiuppa. Hanley denied the accusation.|$|E
25|$|The foreign {{borrowings}} of Irish banks {{rose from}} €15 billion to €110 billion in 2004-08. Much {{of this was}} borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects {{that would not be}} sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the bank guarantee the banks were said to be illiquid (but not insolvent) by €4 billion; {{this turned out to be}} an enormous underestimate.|$|E

25|$|Over 75% of Mantetsu's {{income was}} {{generated}} by its freight business, {{with the key}} to profitability coming from soybean exports, both to Japan proper and to Europe. Soybean production increased exponentially with increasing demand for soy oil, and for soy meal for use in fertilizer and animal feed. By 1927, half of the world's supply of soybean was from Manchuria and the efforts by Mantetsu to expand production and to ship to export ports <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of an extractive colonial economy dependent on a single product.|$|E
25|$|Fast bowlers {{tend to have}} {{an action}} that leaves them either side-on or chest-on {{at the end of}} the run up. A chest-on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of back foot contact, while a side-on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact. West Indian bowler Malcolm Marshall <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of a chest-on bowler, while Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee used a side-on {{technique}} to great effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of the Crystal Palace <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example {{of the concept of}} form following manufacturer's limitations- the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.|$|E

25|$|Sufficiently recovered, Chappell totally {{dominated}} {{the season of}} 1975–76, amassing a record 1547 first-class runs {{at an average of}} 85.9, with five centuries. Appointed as Australian captain, Chappell began with a century in each innings to win the first Test against the West Indies in his adopted home town of Brisbane. This performance was unique in Test cricket at the time (later replicated by Virat Kohli of India in 2014). He led the team to an overwhelming 5–1 win and the title of unofficial world champions. His personal highlight <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> 182* in the Sydney Test.|$|E
25|$|Swelling of {{a volcano}} signals that magma has {{accumulated}} near the surface. Scientists monitoring an active volcano will often measure {{the tilt of}} the slope and track changes {{in the rate of}} swelling. An increased rate of swelling, especially if accompanied by an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions and harmonic tremors is a high probability sign of an impending event. The deformation of Mount St. Helens prior to the May 18, 1980 eruption <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of deformation, as {{the north side of the}} volcano was bulging upwards as magma was building up underneath. Most cases of ground deformation are usually detectable only by sophisticated equipment used by scientists, but they can still predict future eruptions this way.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> one of a product generating a demand, {{rather than the other way}} around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return. Although the surveys were useful in the planning of later lines, the three were never built.|$|E

25|$|The Tri-State {{supercell}} {{is thought}} to have formed around noon about 40 minutes prior to the first tornado reports in Shannon County. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> supercell for the first couple hours of its life, gradually transitioning into a high precipitation (HP) supercell in southern Illinois. The very long track tornado period lasted from around 12:40 pm to 4:40 pm. The supercell then likely produced another significant tornado in southeastern Indiana around 6 pm. Convection had gradually increased in the warm sector throughout the supercell's life cycle. It may have become embedded within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP) by the time it reached south-central Indiana. The supercell is assumed to have decayed around 7 pm. These estimated times indicate the supercell's duration as around 7 hours over a calculated ≈ path.|$|E
25|$|The codename for {{the main}} {{operations}} to take Lae was Operation Postern. Planned as part of wider operations to eventually secure the Huon Peninsula, the operation to capture Lae was planned by General Thomas Blamey, who assumed command of the Allied New Guinea Force, and Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> pincer movement, involving an amphibious assault east of the town, and an airborne landing near Nadzab, 50 kilometres (30mi) to the west. Battle casualties for the 9th Division during Operation Postern amounted to 547, of which 115 were killed and 73 were posted as missing, and 397 were wounded, while the 7th Division suffered 142 casualties, of which 38 were killed. The Japanese lost about 1,500 killed, while a further 2,000 were captured.|$|E
25|$|Tutsis {{naturally}} welcomed this ethnic schism because {{thinking in}} these racialized terms had tangible social benefits – it vindicated their minority domination over the majority Hutus. This administrative propaganda had a subconscious effect of convincing Hutus and Tutsis {{that they were}} in fact members of separate ethnic, not social groups. For Belgian colonial elites, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> “divide and conquer” strategy: cleaving groups along salient social boundaries served as a mechanism in securing colonial control over indigenous groups. Initially, Belgian administrators used an expedient method of classification {{based on the number of}} cattle a person owned – anyone with ten or more cattle was considered a member of the aristocratic Tutsi class. However, the presence of wealthy Hutu was problematic. Then in 1933, the colonial administration institutionalized a more rigid ethnic classification by issuing ethnic identification cards; every Rwandan was officially branded a Tutsi, Hutu, or Twa.|$|E

She chose to write Richard's character in such a way after becoming fascinated with his story and researching his life, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, which led her to believe that [...] "his <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> case of history being rewritten by the victor." ...|$|E

Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, asking why a country [...] "a thousand times more powerful" [...] could not annex Vietnam. Phan concluded that it was [...] "because the destiny of our country has been willed by Heaven itself".|$|E
