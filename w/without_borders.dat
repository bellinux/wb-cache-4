5|$|Cyclone Kesiny struck Madagascar {{during a}} period of {{political}} strife after the Malagasy presidential election in 2001. In the election, incumbent president Didier Ratsiraka lost to Marc Ravalomanana, but rejected the results; after the election, Ratsiraka declared the city of Toamasina as the new capital of the country. The political crisis caused difficulties after the storm in distributing food, and Ratsiraka's operational center in the city was damaged. During the storm, Toamasina experienced severe flooding, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. Emergency volunteers provided water and food to the affected residents. Workers from the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors <b>Without</b> <b>Borders)</b> provided medical assistance to residents in Toamasina during the storm. Damaged roads contributed to economic contraction, after trucks were unable to use roads and bridges in the eastern portion of the country. By October, the political crisis had ended, and the government repaired most of the damaged infrastructure. The cost of repairing the roads and bridges was about $2.5million (2002 USD), which was paid by a $50million credit from the World Bank Group. Due to poor harvest related to the storm in some areas, the World Food Programme provided 18,000tonnes of food to 394,250residents, beginning in November 2002 {{at the request of the}} Malagasy government. After the storm, the government of Norway donated kr1.2million (2002Norwegian krone, 172,000 USD) for storm relief, and the government of Switzerland provided about $33,000 (USD).|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} area {{coverage}} of random sensor networks in bounded domains under a Boolean coverage disk model where all sensors {{are assumed to}} have a common sensing range. We solve the expected area coverage analytically for a circular domain with border effects and for an arbitrary bounded domain <b>without</b> <b>border</b> effects, i. e., when {{the locations of the}} sensors are and are not, respectively, confined to the domain to be covered. We also consider the problem of full coverage of the domain and recognize that this problem, like that of network connectivity, reduces to the problem of determining the distribution of a well-defined threshold range. Focusing on a square domain, again with and <b>without</b> <b>border</b> effects, we utilize existing asymptotic results in building empirical regression models for the threshold range for full coverage. These models allow predicting the relation between the parameters of the sensor network and the probability of full coverage...|$|R
