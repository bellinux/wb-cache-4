40|$|In June 1987, {{work was}} {{initiated}} at LaRC on end-effectors and preloaded joints for robotic truss assembly. This {{is part of}} an on-going research effort centered on a test facility that assembles 1 inch x 2 m identical struts into an 8 m diameter x 1. 5 m deep platform truss. A detailed description of the test facility was published. The end-effector being used for the LaRC assembly demonstration is quite suitable for the Precision Segmented Reflector or other precision applications. These require high stiffness provided by mechanical joint preloads. Stiffness obtained in this manner is only required and provided over a load range far less than the ultimate strength of the strut tubes. Beyond this useful range, truss behavior is somewhat unpredictable. Mechanically preloaded joints of this type are less suitable for applications such as the Aero Brake where predictable strength and stiffness are required over a greater fraction of the load bearing capacity of component parts. Preliminary studies of the Aerobrake support truss indicate that struts of at least 3 different diameters and various lengths would improve performance. The double-ended end-effector currently in service is designed for only one diameter and length. Anticipated single-ended versions can accommodate varying lengths but not multiple diameters. Tradeoff considerations for welded joints relative to their mechanically preloaded counterparts are presented. Conclusions from this research are as follows: (1) repair by cut and re-weld on the original <b>weld</b> <b>site</b> should be research; (2) welded joints, though repairable, should not be used where high repair frequencies are anticipated; and (3) welded joints should be considered for an Aero Brake truss...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Spurilla neapolitana {{from the}} Eastern Mediter-ranean was cultured in a self-sustained, {{temperature-controlled}} laboratory culture system, and its life cycle is described. Adults {{were collected from}} three <b>Weld</b> <b>sites</b> situ-ated 120 km apart, along the Israeli Mediterranean coast-line, between March 2006 and August 2007. Cultures of the life-cycle stages were raised at 24 °C. S. neapolitana depos-ited white, coiled, spiral egg masses containing zygotes. Veliger larvae hatched 3. 0 § 0. 4 days post oviposition. The veliger larvae are obligatory planktotrophs, with a minimal larval phase of 22 days. In the lab, larvae settled and meta-morphosed following exposure to metabolites derived from distinct prey sea anemone species. Reproductive maturity was reached 42 § 5 days post metamorphosis, resulting in a laboratory generation time of 67 days (egg to egg).

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{of steel}} 316 L sheets is {{considered}} {{and the effects}} of laser welding parameters on the laser weld quality and metallurgical changes in the weld section are presented. The laser weld quality is assessed through careful examination of weld geometrical features, and the resulting weld microstructure. Metallurgical changes in the <b>weld</b> <b>sites</b> are examined using optical, and electron scanning microscope (SEM). Two levels of heat inputs are used- 1500 W and 2000 W; and two scanning speeds of 2 cm/s and 4 cm/s are used to laser weld 316 L sheets. It is found that at the high laser power intensities, evaporation takes place in the irradiated region and as the laser power intensity increases further, a cavity is formed at the top surface of the welding cross section. A similar situation is also observed as the laser scanning speed reduces. The low diffusivity of the alloying elements at high temperatures preserves the segregation profile. The scattered partitioning of the cells and dendrite boundaries are observed due to the presence of Cr and Mo...|$|R
40|$|Heat transfer, thermal stresses, {{and thermal}} {{buckling}} {{analyses were performed}} on the unconventional wing structures of a Hyper-X hypersonic flight research vehicle (designated as X- 43) subjected to nominal Mach 7 aerodynamic heating. A wing midspan cross section was selected for the heat transfer and thermal stress analyses. Thermal buckling analysis was performed on three regions of the wing skin (lower or upper); 1) a fore wing panel, 2) an aft wing panel, and 3) a unit panel at {{the middle of the}} aft wing panel. A fourth thermal buckling analysis was performed on a midspan wing segment. The unit panel region is identified as the potential thermal buckling initiation zone. Therefore, thermal buckling analysis of the Hyper-X wing panels could be reduced to the thermal buckling analysis of that unit panel. "Buckling temperature magnification factors" were established. Structural temperature-time histories are presented. The results show that the concerns of shear failure at wing and spar <b>welded</b> <b>sites,</b> and of thermal buckling of Hyper-X wing panels, may not arise under Mach 7 conditions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine whether}} welding {{is a risk}} factor for an {{accelerated}} decline in pulmonary function. METHODS: 2 Year follow up of pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms among 54 welders and 38 non- welders in eight New Zealand <b>welding</b> <b>sites.</b> RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} age, height, smoking habits, ethnicity, or total time in industrial work between welders and non-welders. No overall differences were noted in the changes of pulmonary function variables between the two study groups. However, when the comparison was restricted to smokers, welders had a significantly greater (p = 0. 02) annual decline (88. 8 ml) in FEV 1 than non-welders, who had a slight non-significant annual increase (34. 2 ml). Also, welders without respiratory protection or local exhaust ventilation while welding had a greater annual decline both in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) than welders with protection (p = 0. 001 and 0. 04, respectively). Among welders a significant association was found between the acute across shift change and the annual decline in FEV 1. Chronic bronchitis was more common among welders (24 %) than non-welders (5 %). Only one welder (2 %) but eight non- welders (21 %) reported having asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Welders who smoked and welders working without local exhaust ventilation or respiratory protection have an increased risk of accelerated decline in FEV 1...|$|R
