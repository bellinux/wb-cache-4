25|$|On {{the left}} side, {{there may be}} a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or {{downward}} to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab</b> in both the unlocked and locked positions.|$|E
25|$|All {{cassettes}} {{include a}} write protection mechanism to prevent re-recording and accidental erasure of important material. Each {{side of the}} cassette has a plastic tab on the top that may be broken off, leaving a small indentation in the shell. This indentation allows the entry of a sensing lever that prevents {{the operation of the}} recording function when the cassette is inserted into a cassette deck. If the cassette is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab</b> for the corresponding side is at the top-left. Occasionally, manufacturers provided a movable panel {{that could be used to}} enable or disable write-protect on tapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab</b> on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Notches on the {{top surface}} of the Compact Cassette {{indicate}} its type. The rear-most cassette {{at the top of}} this picture, with only write-protect notches (here covered by <b>write-protect</b> <b>tabs),</b> is Type I, its tape consisting of iron oxide. The next cassette down, with additional notches adjacent to the <b>write-protect</b> <b>tabs,</b> is Type II, its tape consisting of chrome and cobalt. The bottom two cassettes, featuring the Type II notches plus an additional pair in the middle of the cassette, are Type IV (metal); note the removal of the tabs on the second of these, meaning the tape is write-protected.|$|R
25|$|If later required, a {{piece of}} {{adhesive}} tape can be placed over the indentation to bypass the protection, or (on some decks), the lever can be manually depressed to record on a protected tape. Extra care is required to avoid covering the additional indents on high bias or metal bias tape cassettes adjacent to the <b>write-protect</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Secure Digital (SD) cards have a <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab</b> on {{the left}} side.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prevent the}} {{recording}} {{on the tape}} from being erased, {{there is a small}} <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab</b> that can be moved to one of two positions, labeled [...] "REC" [...] and [...] "SAVE". Comparing the sliding tab to a door, the tape is in the [...] "REC" [...] position when the [...] "door" [...] is open and in the [...] "SAVE" [...] position when it is closed. (Not all tape cases have markings for this information.) The tape can only be recorded onto (or recorded over) when this tab is in the [...] "REC" [...] position. This is an improved version of the VHS <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab,</b> which prevents erasure after it has been broken off, requiring covering with adhesive tape or filling with an obstruction to remove the write protection.|$|E
50|$|A {{high-density}} diskette in DOS format formatted as a 720K disk {{would not}} function correctly; the Mac assumed that any high-density disk has been formatted as an HD disk. To solve this problem, a user could cover the square hole {{with a piece}} of tape opposite the <b>write-protect</b> <b>tab,</b> and re-insert the disk. (This square hole identifies the disk as a high-density disk.) Covering the square hole will make it appear to disk drive as a DD disk.|$|E
50|$|Also, the <b>tabs</b> {{covering}} the <b>write-protect</b> notches of Loran cassettes were built-in plastic mechanisms that would open or close the notch {{by turning the}} mechanism with a small flat-blade screwdriver or a fingernail, {{as opposed to the}} <b>write-protect</b> <b>tabs</b> of other cassettes which were broken out instead, as the hardness of the Lexan would've made this very difficult for the average user to accomplish.|$|R
