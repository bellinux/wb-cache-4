This was some <b>what</b> <b>of</b> an event due to Jay Z's agency, Roc Nation, signing on as Dez Bryant’s representation earlier in the month. The pair spoke briefly before the game, which led to questions about whether they were discussing Bryant’s contract negotiations. Jones later claimed that the brief conversation {{had nothing to do}} with contract negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Our {{works in}} stone, in paint, in print are spared, {{some of them}} for a few decades, or a {{millennium}} or two, but everything must finally fall in war or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash. The triumphs and the frauds, the treasures and the fakes. A fact of life. We’re going to die. “Be of good heart,” cry the dead artists out of the living past. Our songs will all be silenced – but <b>what</b> <b>of</b> it? Go on singing. Maybe a man’s name doesn’t matter all that much.|$|E

25|$|<b>What</b> <b>of</b> {{the latest}} {{currents}} of thought? Are they {{likely to lead}} to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.|$|E
500|$|Oosterbaan {{believed}} {{success was}} fleeting. [...] He once {{was quoted in}} Time Magazine as saying, [...] "I'm on top now, {{and there is a}} lot of backslapping. But <b>what</b> <b>of</b> seasons to come? Let me lose the opener or a couple of other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted." [...] As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Dylan's {{performance}} {{provoked a}} hostile {{response from the}} folk music establishment. In the September issue of Sing Out!, Ewan MacColl wrote: [...] "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time...'But <b>what</b> <b>of</b> Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel." [...] On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan {{was back in the}} studio in New York, recording [...] "Positively 4th Street". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia, and it has been interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community—friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.|$|E

500|$|Some would claim... {{that it is}} {{the most}} American of our orchestras, {{thinking}} no doubt of the Previn legacy, Bernstein's Presidency and Tilson Thomas's appointment. Others, looking back further to Pierre Monteux's reign, think it our most French orchestra, a quality nurtured by Previn and latterly Claudio Abbado. But <b>what</b> <b>of</b> their essaying of the Slavonic repertoire under Istvan Kertész, or of Mahler, whose idiom has been finely honed by Abbado? No, the LSO remains enigmatic, unpredictable and supremely individual. Of all the London orchestras the LSO seems to have more [...] "personalities", more [...] "individuals" [...] and has given the solo world more than its fair share of [...] "star" [...] performers. As an orchestra the LSO has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long (one thinks of Karajan in Berlin, Haitink in Amsterdam or Mravinsky in Leningrad) but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Neon Bible {{garnered}} universal acclaim, {{receiving an}} 87—the seventh highest score of 2007—from review aggregator Metacritic. NME reviewer Mark Beaumont commented the album [...] "is a climactic monolith {{of a record}} in the grand tradition of melodic transatlantic clamour rock." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Kyle Ryan interpreted the album as a commentary on the post-9/11 American world, saying that [...] "the band is seemingly sending a beacon to other reasonable people forced underground by the world's insanity." [...] Stylus contributor Derek Miller saw the album in similar terms, saying that while the album touches on [...] "violence, paranoia, the falsity of simple labor, the war-call of organized religion—a what's <b>what</b> <b>of</b> indie turmoil after 2003" [...] the band go further {{to the point where}} its [...] "thematic threads bind the songs." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "A+" [...] grade, saying that Butler and co. [...] "thud rather than thunder. But what a loud and joyous thud it is." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but <b>what</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing he could have said. [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{interview}} {{took place}} {{just as the}} Bond was being established. Being approached by Reitz, Schreiner objected {{to the fact that}} the Bond aimed ultimately to overthrow British rule and remove the British flag from South Africa. To this, Reitz replied: [...] "Well, what if it is so?" [...] Schreiner expostulated in the following terms: [...] "You do not suppose that that flag is going to disappear without a tremendous struggle and hard fighting?" [...] "Well, I suppose not, but even so, <b>what</b> <b>of</b> that?" [...] rejoined Reitz. [...] In the face of this testimony with reference to two of the most prominent of the Bond's promoters, it is impossible to deny that from its beginning the great underlying idea of the Bond was an independent South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, {{the court}} quickly {{detected}} the plot and merely needed confirmation. [...] But <b>what</b> <b>of</b> {{cases where the}} facts were not clear, or the decision was difficult? [...] It was these that provided the gravest difficulties with jury trials following the abolition of trial by ordeal. [...] Upon the calling of a general Court of Eyre, {{it was easy to}} assemble a thousand or more jurors, who could be questioned, and pronounce a prisoner guilty or not. [...] If the proceedings were instigated upon the delivery and indictment from a gaol, before a non-professional judge, most prisoners were coerced to put themselves upon the mercy of a jury trial, and forgo their ancient right to trial by ordeal. If they refused a jury trial, there was no option but to keep them in prison until they changed their mind.|$|E

Cognizable harm takes account of the nature of the interest protected, which is the reason that 'the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition,' leaving it impossible 'to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.' Allen, 468 U. S., at 751." [...] As a proof of this he asked, <b>what</b> <b>of</b> cases where a person was [...] "being forced to compete on an uneven playing field based on race (without showing that an economic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district? These injuries are no more concrete than seeing one’s tax dollars spent on religion, but we have recognized each one as enough for standing." ...|$|E

It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed — men, women and children — indiscriminately."

Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed — but <b>what</b> <b>of</b> that? It was in accordance with our custom."
