5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin.

5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors.

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> a historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E

5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.

Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
