5|$|The Mongols {{crossed the}} frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol {{detachment}} {{under the command}} of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla from town to town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan's death. Batu Khan wanted to attend at the election of Ögödei's successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Trogir, granted it lands near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.|$|E

Scott played football growing up and he has a good arm, but Taylor is faster and I think that would help his draft status." [...] Gaius Charles, who plays [...] "Smash" [...] Williams, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005, determined to find a job within a year, which he did with Friday Night Lights. He describes himself as [...] "all right" [...] at football, but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Australia on the RMS Strathaird, Barr {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force as an air cadet on 4March 1940. [...] After {{undergoing}} instruction on Tiger Moths at No.3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon, and on Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons at No.1 Service Flying Training School, Point Cook, he was commissioned {{as a pilot}} officer on 24September. He gained a reputation {{as something of a}} rebel during training, and became forever known as [...] "Nicky", for [...] "Old Nick", or the Devil. In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students. [...] By November 1940, he had been posted to No.23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron, flying CAC Wirraways on patrol off the Queensland coast. The aircraft was, according to Barr, [...] "our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes {{that we were going to}} encounter, left much to be desired". Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson, and also captained the RAAF rugby union team. He was promoted to flying officer on 24March 1941.|$|E

[...] Ashley describes the period from 1954 to 1960 as a [...] "Golden Age" [...] for New Worlds. [...] Carnell bought J. G. Ballard's first sale, [...] "Escapement", {{which appeared in the}} December 1956 New Worlds; Ballard {{went on to become a}} significant figure in the genre in the 1960s. Ballard <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s. [...] Much of Ballard's work appeared in New Worlds and Science Fantasy, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell [...] "recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he encouraged me to go on writing in my own way." [...] Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with [...] "Visitors' Book" [...] in the April 1955 New Worlds. [...] James White began publishing with [...] "Assisted Passage" [...] in the January 1953 New Worlds, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with [...] "Sector General" [...] in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as The Day of the Triffids, began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with [...] "For All the Night" [...] in the April 1958 issue. [...] Arthur C. Clarke, another very successful British sf writer of the period, wrote relatively few short stories for the British market, but did publish [...] "Who's There" [...] in the November 1958 New Worlds. [...] Colin Kapp began his popular [...] "Unorthodox Engineers" [...] series with [...] "The Railways up on Cannis", in October 1959.

[...] In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: [...] "I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class." [...] As noted in 1945 by political scientist Hugh Seton-Watson, there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: [...] "however much [...] cursed the regime, he <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> it for one thing.

2500|$|In May 1668, Ashley became ill, {{apparently}} with a hydatid cyst. His secretary, John Locke, recommended {{an operation}} that almost certainly saved Ashley's life and Ashley <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Locke {{for the rest of}} his life. As part of the operation, a tube was inserted to drain fluid from the abscess, and after the operation, the physician left the tube in the body, and installed a copper tap to allow for possible future drainage. In later years, this would be the occasion for his Tory enemies to dub him [...] "Tapski", with the Polish ending because Tories accused him of wanting to make England an elective monarchy like the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

Only afterward did Egan celebrate by finally renting and watching the entire film for the first time. Although Egan did not feel particularly pressured about the role, she <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> be surrounded by a supporting cast of veteran Broadway performers.|$|E

[...] When Pei was receiving his commission as chancellor, pursuant to customs, he was dancing to show gratefulness to the emperor, but as he danced, he fell to the ground, and Yuan had to help him up and to give thanks on his behalf. [...] Pei died around the new year 770 and was posthumously honored. [...] Emperor Daizong further had an award of silk and grain sent to his family.

[...] At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian (李子千) and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (鄭濡), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's era name {{in order not to}} completely break from Tang. [...] On December 9, 782, in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi. [...] They also established administrations with governmental structures paralleling the Tang imperial government to further show independence, although the titles were intentionally different from Tang's to show some subordination.|$|E
