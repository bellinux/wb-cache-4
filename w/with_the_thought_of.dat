25|$|Dualism {{is closely}} {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> René Descartes (1641), {{which holds that}} the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, {{he was the first}} to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.|$|E

He ordained his nephew Mansur Sefaro a priest, and in 1831 sent him to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham (1820–61), who consecrated him at Urmi and appointed him metropolitan over the Nestorians of Amadiya. The new metropolitan took the name Eliya, the traditional name of the Chaldean patriarchs, and shortly afterwards abandoned the pretence of being a Nestorian and was re-admitted into the Chaldean church, ultimately becoming the first Chaldean bishop of Aqra in 1852.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to create}} a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of {{education}} that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day.|$|E

25|$|Schelling {{held that}} the {{divisions}} imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as {{the outcome of the}} single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.|$|E

While James cast doubt on the effectiveness of the laundromat as a metaphor, she pointed to Kelly's vocal performance during the chorus as the song's highlight. However, Laura Checkoway viewed the [...] "banter between the barely legal Nivea and Kelly [...] unsettling" [...] because of the allegations that he had sexual relationships with girls under the age of consent. Echoing this thought, writer Mark Anthony Neal agreed with Checkoway's assessment in his 2010 article [...] "Bringing Up Daddy: A Black Feminist Fatherhood".

500|$|An early critic, D. W. Harding, {{viewed the}} poem as {{being part of}} a new concept within poetry. Similarly, Edwin Muir saw that the poem had new aspects to it and felt that there was beauty in the poem similar to that in The Hollow Men. Peter Quennell agreed and {{described}} the poem as [...] "a new and remarkably accomplished poem" [...] featuring [...] "uncommon rhythmic virtuosity". Marianne Moore stated that it was [...] "a new poem which is concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> control [...] embodied in Deity and in human equipoise". She argued that its [...] "best quality" [...] was [...] "in its reminders of how severe, strenuous, and practical was the poet's approach toward the present enlargement of his philosophical vision."

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Weber and his addition of ethical considerations {{to the subject}} of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E

Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy {{with the results of}} the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs.
