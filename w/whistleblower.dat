5000|$|Many <b>whistleblowers</b> {{have stated}} that they were {{motivated}} {{to take action to}} put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations. A 2009 study found that <b>whistleblowers</b> are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening. There are generally two metrics by which <b>whistleblowers</b> determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle. On the other hand, [...] "value-driven" [...] <b>whistleblowers</b> are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, <b>whistleblowers</b> have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Whistleblower</b> is a Canadian–German co-production. Weisz {{received}} the script from producer Amy Kaufman in 2007. Since {{she was pregnant}} with her son at the time, she initially turned down the offer. She said the story haunted her, and she later contacted Kaufman to ask if the project was still available. She signed on in August 2009, and shooting began in October 2009.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Whistleblower</b> {{is based}} on the {{experiences}} of Kathryn Bolkovac, an American police officer who in 1999 was assigned to serve as a peacekeeper with the United Nations in post-war Bosnia. While there, she reportedly discovered a sex-trafficking ring which served and was facilitated by other peacekeepers. Bolkovac was fired after trying to investigate the ring, but she later won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The Winkler County nurse <b>whistleblower</b> {{case was}} a series of legal {{proceedings}} in West Texas that centered on the retaliation upon two nurses who submitted an anonymous state medical board complaint against a physician in 2009. The case attracted national attention for its implications on whistleblowing by nurses. After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an anonymous complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the Texas Medical Board (TMB).|$|E
40|$|Although <b>whistleblowers</b> {{are often}} portrayed as courageous {{individuals}} deserving of respect, {{the act of}} whistleblowing {{can be viewed as}} a disloyal act which may bring much harm to the <b>whistleblower's</b> colleagues. We argue that although some <b>whistleblowers</b> have provided a great service to society, the world would be best served if the need for external whistleblowing were obviated by appropriate management practices...|$|R
50|$|<b>Whistleblowers</b> {{that may}} be at risk of those they are exposing are now using {{encryption}} methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity. Tor, a highly accessible anonymity network, is one that is frequently used by <b>whistleblowers</b> around the world. Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential <b>whistleblowers</b> who may wish to anonymously leak information.|$|R

5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and <b>whistleblower</b> protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn <b>whistleblower</b> than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in <b>whistleblower</b> protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce <b>whistleblower</b> protection legislation.|$|E

50|$|A {{commission}} of investigation {{was set up}} into the recording of telephone calls at Garda stations.

40|$|The {{international}} community is increasingly becoming aware of the consequences and the risks involved with blowing the whistle on organizational misconduct. Subsequently, {{there has been a}} growing trend within the {{international community}} of developing legislation designed to protect <b>whistleblowers</b> against retaliation. This study performs a Critical Discourse Analysis on The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act of 2005, the first bill in Canadian legislative history to offer federal government <b>whistleblowers</b> protection. The author argues the primary aim of this Act is not to protect <b>whistleblowers</b> from retaliation or to eliminate wrongdoing from the public service, but rather to control the context under which whistleblowing can occur. It is thus an instrument of oppression serving not to protect <b>whistleblowers,</b> but suppress them...|$|R
5|$|Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a <b>whistleblower</b> and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, {{and called}} Michálek untrustworthy despite his public {{reputation}} as a <b>whistleblower.</b> Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was {{a blow to the}} party's standing. The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations. On December 21, 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's mishandling. Michálek returned to the State Environmental Fund as a financial analyst in 2011. The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus for a lack of evidence as of September 2012. As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{grand jury}} {{continued}} its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket pardon. Two were returned against members of Fletcher's staff, {{and two were}} against unpaid advisors to Fletcher. The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a <b>whistleblower.</b> Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon. On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could {{be included in the}} jury's final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon. Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|A later {{amendment}} to the Act also provided protections for employees, <b>whistleblowers,</b> who raise nuclear safety concerns. <b>Whistleblowers</b> who believe they suffered retaliation for their protected activities have to file a written complaint with the United States Department of Labor (DOL) within 180 days of the first notice of the adverse action. The <b>whistleblowers</b> would later have a choice to have their claim heard by a DOL administrative law judge or to file a lawsuit in court and seek a trial to a judge or jury.|$|R

5|$|There {{are five}} main {{characters}} in Doom 3. The player assumes {{the role of}} an anonymous space marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC's Mars base. The player's non-commissioned officer in-charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who gives the player objectives and advice over the player's radio {{for the first half of}} the game. The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger, head scientist of the UAC's enigmatic Delta Labs division, who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity. Betruger's demonic voice, provided by Philip L. Clarke, frequently taunts the player as the game progresses. The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell. Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC's board of directors, sent to check up on Betruger's research as well as investigate the rising number of accidents on the Mars base after a request for assistance from a <b>whistleblower.</b> He is almost always accompanied by Campbell, another space marine who acts as Swann's bodyguard and is armed with a BFG 9000. Campbell is voiced by Andy Chanley. Swann and Campbell are often shown in the game to be a few steps ahead of the player, but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game. The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the story or assist the player in certain segments. The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base, as well as fellow marines and security guards. Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen.|$|E
