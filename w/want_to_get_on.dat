500|$|In January 1915, Lloyd {{appeared}} at the Crystal Palace where she entertained over ten thousand troops. [...] At {{the end of that}} year, she performed her only war song, [...] "Now You've Got your Khaki On", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier. [...] Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs [...] "If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>On</b> in Revue", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and [...] "The Three Ages of Woman", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective. She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death. During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated. Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like [...] "someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E

2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{affected the}} building project, with some contractors becoming reluctant {{to work on}} it, and community relations. According to Professor Saleh Sbenaty of Middle Tennessee State University, {{a board member of}} the ICM, [...] "kids [...] asking their mothers who have head scarves not to go to the malls because they're scared of seeing their mom being harassed," [...] while adults had become [...] "afraid to come to the mosque and pray." [...] One contractor told ICM officials that although he needed the work, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> bad terms with my preacher." [...] The ICM had to pay significantly more for the project because of contractors' reluctance to work on it. It also had to hire a security guard to protect the Veals Road construction site and install a security system in its existing building.|$|E
2500|$|The jury's {{finding that}} the audit was legitimately work-related and not an {{investigation}} of misconduct may ultimately have hurt the city, Higgins wrote, since it focused attention on whether {{it was necessary to}} read the messages. Had it been found to be investigatory, there would have been more grounds to rule the audit a reasonable search. Other public employers facing similar litigation [...] "will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the court record that their search was for some purpose that will not only pass as reasonable at its inception under the facts of the case...and will also allow the court to find that the actual method was not excessive in relation to the purpose". They would be best served, she concluded, by making clear, explicit policies on personal use of communications devices and rigorously enforcing those policies. Informal policies in partial or complete conflict with formal ones had created problems for employers {{in other areas of the}} law, and it was better to prevent such lawsuits from arising altogether.|$|E

2500|$|From mid-1996 Skunkhour {{created a}} new sound, abandoning spoken-word content and {{focusing}} more on melody. Aya described the re-defining moment when Dean provided the bass guitar for [...] "Foam": [...] "It really turned things around. That bassline is just out of control, and I was like, 'God, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> this'. When Deano pulled out that bassline {{it was like he}} was leading us into battle." [...] By that time Chris Simms had been added to live gigs as a percussionist. Their third album, Chin Chin, which was co-produced by the group with Magoo (Regurgitator), was preceded by its lead single, [...] "Breathing Through My Eyes" [...] in April. Chin Chin was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim and peaked at No.34. The Sun-Heralds Peter Holmes described it as [...] "a massive leap forward" [...] from the [...] "cliched, choppy funk material" [...] of their first two albums, concluding: [...] "Skunkhour's overall feel is heavier, the grooves are deeper and the arrangements a little rockier".|$|E
