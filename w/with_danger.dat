5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs <b>with</b> <b>danger</b> when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs <b>with</b> <b>danger.</b> Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association <b>with</b> <b>danger,</b> while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E

25|$|According to Martin (1999), {{police work}} {{involves}} {{substantial amounts of}} emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion {{in the presence of}} other officers and citizens. Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing <b>with</b> <b>danger</b> on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work. While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen trust and compliance. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.|$|E

25|$|Thomas G. Plaskett, {{a former}} American Airlines and Continental executive, {{replaced}} Acker as president in January 1988 (joining Pan Am from the latter). While {{a program to}} refurbish Pan Am aircraft and improve the company's on-time performance began showing positive results (in fact, Pan Am's most profitable quarter ever was {{the third quarter of}} 1988), on December 21, 1988, the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 by Abdelbaset al-Megrahi above Lockerbie, Scotland, resulted in 270 fatalities. Pan Am's iconic image had made it a repeated target for terrorists, resulting in many travelers avoiding the airline as they had begun to associate it <b>with</b> <b>danger.</b> Faced with a $300million lawsuit filed by more than 100 families of the Pan Am flight 103 victims, the airline subpoenaed records of six U.S. government agencies, including the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the State Department. Though the records suggested that the U.S. government was aware of warnings of a bombing and failed to pass the information to the airline, the families claimed Pan Am was attempting to shift the blame.|$|E
25|$|In a {{rally in}} Buxar on 26 October, Modi vowed to defend {{reservation}} of Dalits, STs, OBCs. He said of the Mahagathbandhanthat {{it was trying to}} hatch a conspiracy to carve out a sub-quota on the basis of religion as the Supreme Court of India has said reservation cannot be more than 50%. On 27 October, in Bettiah, he again accused Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav of diluting the share of SC, ST and OBC. It promoted the view that an attempt was being made to take the reservation of Dalits and other OBCs and give it to other minorities. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also agreed with Modi's assertions that the idea of reservations on the basis of religion is fraught <b>with</b> <b>danger.</b> On 1 November, Modi repeated the allegations that the two leaders came together in July 2005 to demand a review of the policy to provide for religion-based reservation. A video dating from 2005 which was leaked showed Lalu was asking for a quota for Muslims. On 3 July, BJP announced its seventh morcha, the BJP OBC Morcha, reportedly in regards to the election.|$|E

500|$|After the {{relatively}} lukewarm commercial {{performance of their}} previous record, No Line on the Horizon (2009), lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty over how the band could remain musically relevant. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence—the longest gap between albums of their career—the group reportedly worked on three separate projects with multiple producers, including an aborted companion to their previous record called Songs of Ascent. However, they struggled to complete an album to their satisfaction and continually delayed a release. After working <b>with</b> <b>Danger</b> Mouse for two years, the group collaborated with Flood, Epworth, and Tedder to complete the record. Thematically, it revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to musical inspirations Ramones and the Clash. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written".|$|E
500|$|The wolf is [...] {{a common}} motif in the {{foundational}} mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout Eurasia and North America (corresponding {{to the historical}} extent of the habitat of the gray wolf). The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a predator, and correspondingly it is strongly associated <b>with</b> <b>danger</b> and destruction, making it {{the symbol of the}} warrior on one hand, and that of the devil on the other. The modern [...] trope of the Big Bad Wolf is a development of this. The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples, both of the Eurasian steppe and of the North American Plains. In many cultures, the identification of the warrior with the wolf (totemism) gave rise to the notion of Lycanthropy, the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf.|$|E

500|$|As Madoka contemplates {{accepting}} {{the contract with}} Kyubey, she witnesses the death of Mami {{at the hands of}} a witch and realizes that a magical girl's life is filled <b>with</b> <b>danger,</b> anguish, and suffering. This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura, a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers that not only do magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems, the source of their magic, but when those Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, they transform into the very witches they fight against. This is exemplified when Sayaka, heavily disillusioned with the current state of the world, falls into an irrecoverable despair that turns her into a witch. It is then revealed that Kyubey's alien race is harvesting the emotions from magical girls to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times in order to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate.|$|E

Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting.

Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working <b>with</b> <b>Danger</b> Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along.
