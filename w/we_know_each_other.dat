500|$|As media {{scrutiny}} on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These {{began in}} North Africa when some reporters {{worried that he}} was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies. His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke. Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford England and said, in part, [...] "since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the better job we will do." [...] The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians. On a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them [...] "the real heroes" [...] of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers {{who had been killed}} in action. His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said [...] "enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time." [...] This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.|$|E
2500|$|With Eritrea's {{refusal to}} accept the US/Rwanda peace plan, on 22 February 1999 Ethiopia {{launched}} a massive military offensive to recapture Badme. Tension had been high since 6 February 1999, when Ethiopia claimed that Eritrea had violated the moratorium on air raids by bombing Adigrat, a claim it later withdrew. Surveying the extensive trenches the Eritreans had constructed, Ethiopian General Samora Yunis observed, [...] "The Eritreans are good at digging trenches and we are good at converting trenches into graves. They, too, know this. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> very well".|$|E
2500|$|The {{main concern}} of Igbo Jews {{is how to}} be part of the wider Jewish world, {{according}} to the spokesman of [...] "Gihon Hebrews Synagogue" [...] in Abuja, Prince Azuka Ogbukaa. In 2013 the American writer Shai Afsai invited two of the Igbo Jewish leaders, Azuka Ogbukaa (Pinchas) and Elder Ovadiah Agbai, to Rhode Island in the United States. [...] Afsai wrote: “Their 12-day visit has helped solidify a budding relationship between the Rhode Island and Abuja communities. Now that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> a little better, we may consider what further joys and responsibilities this relationship entails”.|$|E

60|$|Well, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> names now, {{and that}} was some satisfaction. I rather liked hers--Ajor! And she seemed to like mine, for she {{repeated}} it.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2016, leaked texted {{messages}} between Letizia and businessman Javier Lopez Madrid {{created a}} controversy. Together with other executives {{and board members}} of the Caja Madrid and Bankia financial group, Madrid {{had been accused of}} corruption. In October 2014 Letizia pledged her support for him, texting [...] "We know who you are and you know who we are. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> like each other, respect each other. To hell with the rest. Kisses yoga mate (miss you!!!)". Felipe also joined in, texting [...] "We do indeed!" [...] Publication of the texts by the newspaper El Diario threatened to undo the line Felipe had drawn between himself and the scandal of Infanta Cristina and her husband, as well as questions over the origins of ex-King Juan Carlos's private fortune. A palace official subsequently stated that the King and Queen were no longer friends with Madrid due to his legal issues.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you--so good of you. Please sit down. Carson and I {{were only}} fighting--he's going pretty soon. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at art school in Berkeley. Now {{he knows all}} the toffs in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no secret,--none {{at least}} from you, or from mamma; and, indeed, none from him. We were both very foolish, {{thinking}} that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and our own hearts, when <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> neither." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy," [...] {{replied the}} Palmer, folding his arms contemptuously in his cloak, [...] "I scorn thy menaces--I leave thee not till <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> better!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come,' said my host, {{with almost}} a sprightly air. 'Now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> draw our chairs {{to the fire}} and let's keep this {{birthday}} in a proper fashion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Alvina gaily, [...] "we can please {{ourselves}} what we do, {{whatever we}} say. I shall say {{we think of}} getting married in the summer, when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> better, and going to Italy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No further, Mr. Delafield," [...] {{interrupted}} Charlotte, {{advancing to}} him with a kind, but unembarrassed air, and offering her hand--"we part friends at least; but I think, now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> sentiments, <b>we</b> had better separate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, nor to be blamed. What {{good can}} come of reproaches? <b>We</b> now <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> faults, if <b>we</b> never did before.

6000|$|... 'Venetia,' he {{at length}} said, turning the {{conversation}} to a more interesting topic, 'your father and myself have disburthened our minds to each, other this morning; I think <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> now as well {{as if we were}} as old acquaintances as myself and his daughter.' ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} missing. I had felt it when I was speaking. To me my voice {{had had no}} ring of conviction. And then I saw what it was. There was no mystery. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> too well. Friendship kills love.|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to reply when Dave, the ground-keeper, called me to the door, saying {{there was a man}} to see me. I went out, and there stood Morrisey, manager of the Chicago American League team. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> well and {{exchanged}} greetings.|$|R
60|$|I have {{concluded}} that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> too well. Though accustomed to gather together in my rooms of an evening in London, we had each his private chambers to retire to, but in the Arcadia solitude was impossible. There was no escaping from <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} are shy," [...] Miss Merton said smiling, [...] "but you had a reason; perhaps some day when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> better you will tell me. I have been scolding Jack for making such a figure of himself. You are his friend and should not let him do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more sentiment, please, John. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> now; {{and when}} I find a friend, I {{never let him}} go.

6000|$|... "At {{one time}} he {{imagined}} himself back in his courting days, and pleaded, 'Say you love me, Louise. I know you do. I can read it in your eyes.

6000|$|... "I'll {{not answer}} for that, Sir Jarvy," [...] {{returned}} the rear-admiral, with a vacant smile; [...] "for she passed some {{time at the}} court of le Grand Monarque.

5000|$|Colletchose six names {{absolutely}} arbitrarily, {{those of}} Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and me simply because <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and <b>we</b> were pals and {{appeared on the}} same musical programmes, no matter if our temperaments and personalities weren't at all the same!

6000|$|My friend's {{wonderful}} face pitied my simplicity. [...] "Lord! {{for what}} do you take us?

6000|$|... 'No, no; <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> too well. I {{have been}} free {{ever since that}} fatal affair of young Darrell, and travel has {{restored}} my spirits a little.

6000|$|... "No, {{you will}} not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm?

6000|$|... 'How {{on earth}} did I get to hear of it, {{you were going to}} say. Well, no need to conceal anything. Fact is, down here to look into the matter. Detective.
