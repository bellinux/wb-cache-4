During the following discussions, {{it was agreed that}} the US <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> AI, while Canada <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> ASV.

5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{into account}} {{all of the}} victims of persecution, the Nazis {{systematically}} killed an estimated six million Jews and an additional 11 million people during the war.

5|$|Thomas S. Hischak, {{author of}} American Literature on Stage and Screen: 525 Works and Their Adaptations, {{claims that the}} Thanhouser {{production}} is the earliest known film adaptation of the novel. This is an error because Lubin <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> an adaptation, 700 feet in length, by October 1903.|$|E
5|$|Universal {{wanted a}} sequel to Jaws early into {{the success of the}} {{original}} film. Producers Brown and Zanuck realized that someone else <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> the film if they did not, and preferred {{to be in charge of}} the project themselves.|$|E

5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne {{was on hand}} for {{powering}} up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall {{and others on the}} day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366grams of coal <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> 1kWh of {{electricity}} during 2006.

Hydropower saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E

MDFMK {{released}} one self-titled album with Republic/Universal Records, and toured North America. After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> the next album, Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records and asked if they'd be interested in signing KMFDM. The label agreed, although at the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate.|$|E
5|$|Following {{publication}} of the novel, Hjortsberg began developing a screenplay for a film adaptation, {{but was unable to}} secure a film studio that <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> his script. The project resurfaced in 1985, when producer Elliott Kastner brought the book to Parker's attention. Parker began work on a new script, and made several changes from Hjortsberg's novel. The film was produced by Carolco Pictures with a budget of $18 million. Principal photography commenced in March 1986 and concluded in June of that year. Filming took place on location in New York City and New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|He {{would bet}} on anything—perhaps {{he was the}} {{original}} of the saying about flies crawling up the window.

5|$|In 1943, Goebbels {{began to}} {{pressure}} Hitler {{to introduce measures}} that <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> total war, including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures {{to increase the number}} of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E
5|$|It {{could be}} {{possible}} to build a surface base that <b>would</b> <b>produce</b> fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.
