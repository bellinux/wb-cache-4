40|$|This {{study has}} two {{distinct}} objectives: to evaluate how effectively the family life education program at Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Hamilton, Ontario is meeting its stated objectives and {{to evaluate the}} relative effectiveness of a traditional teaching method and an annovative teaching method with this family life education program. There are three groups in this study. The first group took the family life education program taught with the innovative method, the second group took the family life education program taught with the traditional method,a nd the third group did not take a family life education program. Students in all three groups were administered a pretest questionnaire in October, 1975 and a posttest questionnaire in May, 1976. Tests of significance were applied {{to all of the}} following hypotheses: Degree of change in the proportion of students <b>who</b> report <b>having</b> positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> occupational goals will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students {{with a high level of}} self-esteem will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> the family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students <b>who</b> report <b>having</b> positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friend and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a high level of self-esteem will be greater for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program than for students <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the traditionally taught family life education program. Analysis of the pretest data showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups on age, sex, religion, father’s education, father’s occupation, participation in class, birth position, grade average, relationships with others, help-seeking behaviour, level of assertiveness, the proportion having career goals or attitude toward marriage and woman’s role. The control group had a significantly higher level of self-esteem at pretest. At posttest, this significant difference had disappeared. We also found that there had been a significant increase in the proportion of comparison group respondents who felt that trial marriages was acceptable for others. The experimental group, at posttest, showed a significant increase in help-seeking behaviour with siblings. There were also two significant findings which were in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. The control group showed a significantly less traditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role on two counts; there was a significant increase in the number of control group respondents who were undecided about having children, and there was a significant increase in the percentage <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a positive attitude toward trial marriage for themselves. Only one of the hypotheses predicting greater effectiveness for the innovative teaching method was supported; that students <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the innovatively taught family life education program would be more likely to seek help from siblings with their personal problems. The traditionally taught family life educationa program proved significantly more effective in increasing the proportion of students who found trial marriage acceptable for others. These findings give tentative support ot the proposition that the family life education program at Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Hamilton, Ontario meeting its stated objectives, as outlined in the text. They also suggest that the traditional teaching method and the innovative roleplaying method are equally effective with this particular course material and these particular teachers...|$|R

With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft.

5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E

5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on a country road and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Imoen and Irenicus {{have been}} removed to an asylum called Spellhold, which is {{situated}} on an island. But Irenicus soon breaks his bonds and prepares to experiment on Imoen. Back in Athkatla, the party raises the money necessary and receives assistance from whichever organization it has decided to work with, and gains passage to the island on a ship sailed by Saemon Havarian. The heroes then manage to get inside Spellhold, but are there captured by Irenicus, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> control of the prison and had planned all along to bring the protagonist there. Irenicus subjects the protagonist to a ritual which takes the protagonist's soul. Imoen, who is revealed to also be a Child of Bhaal, has already been subjected to Irenicus's ritual, and her soul has gone to Irenicus's sister Bodhi. Bodhi then abandons the party to the maze beneath Spellhold so she may hunt them. When they face her, the now soulless protagonist loses self-control and transforms into a creature called the Slayer, one of the avatar forms of Bhaal, which scares off Bodhi. The hero returns to their normal self, and the party battles Irenicus, forcing him to retreat. The party follows, and reaches the surface via the Underdark.|$|E
5|$|The first Halloween comic was {{published}} by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled Halloween, {{it was intended to}} be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20. These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to Halloween H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.|$|E
