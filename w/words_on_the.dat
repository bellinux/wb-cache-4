These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other <b>words,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water {{into and out of the}} mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|The name {{by which}} the series is known today is not Goya's own. His {{handwritten}} title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> series. With these works, he breaks {{from a number of}} painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, IBM {{announced}} the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated {{the appearance of}} a printed page, an effect that was further enhanced by a typewriter ribbon innovation that produced clearer, sharper <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page. The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the IBM Executive series typewriters.|$|E
25|$|A {{teleprompter}} is {{a display}} device that prompts the person speaking {{with an electronic}} visual text of a speech or script.

The screen is in front of and usually below the lens of the camera, and the <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen are reflected to the eyes of the performer using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter. The teleprompter was invented in 1950 by Hubert Schlafly, who was working at 20th Century Fox film studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|The {{form of an}} Interlingua word is {{considered}} an international prototype {{with respect to the}} other <b>words.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled tempore and not *tempus or *tempo in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as temporal.|$|E

25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, {{it is not}} surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form the <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetry.|$|E
25|$|The massive size of text {{available}} on the Web {{can be seen in}} the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by AltaVista saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Web. This reveals the potential strength and accuracy of using the Web as a Corpus given its significant size, which warrants much additional research such as the project currently being carried out by the British National Corpus to exploit its scale.|$|E
25|$|But the Silmaril escaped {{them again}} and was borne by Eärendil into the West. That Silmaril {{was lost to}} the sons of Fëanor but two more {{remained}} inside the crown of Morgoth. So after the War of Wrath the two remaining oath-takers, Maedhros and Maglor, stole the two Silmarils from the camp of the victorious West (the other five brothers were dead by this time). However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers in their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the Silmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted: in their anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm, and Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Maglor would spend eternity wandering the shore, lamenting his fate (though in Tolkien's final <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, Maglor cast himself with his Silmaril into the sea).|$|E
