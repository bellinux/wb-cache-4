5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of those}} killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people also died there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up {{and sent to the}} ghettos; at a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be {{deported}} to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot.

5|$|P. S. Raman, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Chennai in 1963 to join {{a medical}} college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E
5|$|The war to {{the south}} {{influenced}} British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, felt too {{far removed from the}} provincial government in Halifax, so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. {{was eager}} for James Whale, fresh from his great success with Bride of Frankenstein, to direct Dracula's Daughter.

Wary of {{directing}} two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that {{the same sort of}} audiences <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Thin Man as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success. Laemmle agreed to buy the rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.|$|E
