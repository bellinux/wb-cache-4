5|$|Current Electoral College rules allow a {{candidate}} to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> while losing the popular vote, as happened in the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. In the 2000 election, the outcome was decided {{by a margin of}} 537 votes in Florida, despite a 543,895 margin in the other direction nationally.|$|E
5|$|As president, John Quincy Adams had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> a year later.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{the nation}} {{suffered}} a severe financial crisis, {{and the government}} approached the International Monetary Fund for relief funds. This was the limit to what the nation could bear {{and led to the}} opposition leader Kim Dae-jung <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in <b>the</b> same year. This is the first time an opposition candidate <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
50|$|General George Washington <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> {{without any}} major opposition. As the runner-up {{in the electoral}} college, John Adams was elected vice president. Fearing an electoral college tie that could end with Adams <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency,</b> Alexander Hamilton {{arranged}} for several electors to vote for other candidates, including John Jay, who finished with the third most electoral votes.|$|R

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
5|$|Hoosiers {{voted in}} favor of the Republicans in 1860, and in January 1861, Indiana's newly elected {{lieutenant}} governor, Oliver P. Morton, became governor after Henry Smith Lane resigned from the office to take a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate. Hoosiers also helped Abraham Lincoln <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in the 1860 election and {{voted in favor}} of his re-election in 1864. Although Lincoln won only 40 percent of the country's popular vote in the U.S. presidential election in 1860, he earned Indiana's 13 electoral votes with 51.09 percent of its popular vote, compared to Stephen Douglas's 42.44 percent, John Breckenridge's 4.52 percent, and John Bell's 1.95 percent. In the 1864 presidential election, Lincoln once again carried the state, this time by a wider margin, earning Indiana's electoral votes with 53.6 percent of the state's popular vote compared to George McClellan's 46.4 percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two {{new states}} were {{admitted}} into the Union during Jackson's presidency: Arkansas (June 15, 1836) and Michigan (January 26, 1837). Both states helped Van Buren <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1836 and increased Democratic power in Congress.|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{significant}} loss in {{the election}} of 1856, Republican leaders realized that even though they appealed only to Northern voters, they need win only two more states, such as Pennsylvania and Illinois, to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1860.|$|E
25|$|Four {{other parties}} {{nominated}} candidates that had ballot access or write-in access {{to at least}} 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> through {{a majority of the}} electoral college.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, ten electors, in an {{open letter}} headed by Christine Pelosi to the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, demanded an {{intelligence}} briefing in light of Russian interference in the election to help Trump <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Fifty-eight additional electors subsequently added their names to the letter, bringing the total to 68 electors from 17 different states. On December 16, the briefing request was denied.|$|E

25|$|Robinson {{became the}} first Labour Party {{candidate}}, the first woman and the first non-Fianna Fáil candidate {{in the history of}} contested presidential elections to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Famously, RTÉ broadcast her victory speech live rather than the Angelus. Her first television interview as President Elect was on the RTÉ children's television show The Den with Ray D'Arcy, Zig and Zag (puppets) and Dustin the Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{served as}} Brizola's {{campaign}} organizer and primary political adviser in his bids for the Brazilian Presidency in 1989 and 1994. In 1989, Brizola finished in third place, losing the second position, {{which would have}} qualified him for a runoff against Fernando Collor de Mello, by a very narrow margin to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brizola and Unger both supported Lula {{in the second round}} of the election, but Collor would go on to beat Lula and <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{candidate}} must {{receive an}} absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270) to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives {{a majority in}} the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the Twelfth Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote-winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote-winners as vice president.|$|E

25|$|Unger {{also helped}} {{organize}} the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. Unger had written The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again {{in the second round}} of the election, Unger supported Lula who went on to defeat José Serra to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arif {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} in 1966, in what may have been an act of {{sabotage}} by Ba'athist elements in the Iraqi military. Abd ar-Rahman al-Bazzaz became acting president for three days, and a power struggle for the presidency occurred. In the first meeting of the Defense Council and cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful, and Abdul Rahman Arif was elected president. He was viewed by army officers as weaker and easier to manipulate than his brother.|$|E
25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E
