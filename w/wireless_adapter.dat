The new titles were developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which originally came bundled with the games. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles. The two games hold {{the distinction of being}} the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.|$|E

After completing a track for the first time, the player unlocks a time trial mode for this track, and a boss battle. The action-oriented boss battles involve defeating a generally static Digimon using items scattered throughout the areas, which are not designed as race tracks. The player can also compete in single races unrelated to the story in any unlocked tracks. The game uses the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> or Game Link Cable accessories for a multiplayer racing mode supporting up to four players.|$|E

500|$|FireRed and LeafGreens {{connectivity}} {{with the}} Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> was heralded by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata as being able [...] "to enhance head-to-head battles, exchange of information, and communication with others." [...] An enhanced interface {{was created for}} the game to increase usability for new players, {{as well as a}} contextual in-game help system that could aid lost or confused players during their journey. President of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishiharu noted, [...] "We don't feel that this a remake at all. We feel that this is a new game, with wireless technology", referring to the bundled <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the <b>Wireless</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{exclusive}} Japanese {{production run}} for FireRed and LeafGreen {{was limited to}} half a million copies, despite the success of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. IGN speculated that Nintendo was expecting less demand for the new games, or that it was limited by {{the production of the}} bundled <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter.</b> The east American versions of FireRed and LeafGreen were secondly indirectly announced at DICE in 2004. Although the original games were released as Red and Blue in North America, the remakes retained the Japanese names of [...] "Red" [...] and [...] "Green". Masuda noted this as a choice on his part, stating the leaf represented a peaceful icon, in contrast to the alternative of water which he saw as suggesting conflict with the icon of fire used by the other game.|$|E

The new titles {{were developed}} by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which originally came bundled with the games. However, due to the new variables added to LeafGreen and FireRed (such as changing the single, [...] "Special" [...] stat into two separate [...] "Special Attack" [...] and [...] "Special Defense" [...] stats), these titles are not compatible with older versions. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan on January 29, 2004, and released to North America and Europe on September 9 and October 1, respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles.|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} week of release in Japan, FireRed and LeafGreen sold a {{combined}} total of 885,039 copies, which was less than the amount sold by Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire in that time period, but IGN reasoned that the smaller sales were due to the new titles being remakes. In {{the first half of}} August before FireRed and LeafGreen were released in the U.S., the games received over 150,000 pre-orders, over twice the amount that Ruby and Sapphire received. Nintendo's Senior Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Communication George Harrison remarked, [...] "This pre-sell indicates more than twice the player interest!" [...] Over one million copies of FireRed and LeafGreen were sold in the US less than one month after their release in that region. As of March 31, 2008, the games had sold 11.82million copies worldwide. The games later entered Nintendo's Player's Choice line in North America and were re-marketed with a significantly lower retail price. However, unlike the original release, the Player's Choice edition games did not include a bundled <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter.</b>|$|E
500|$|The games {{support the}} Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, through which {{connected}} players may trade or battle.

FireRed and LeafGreen also have the ability to connect to the Nintendo GameCube and interact with [...] In Box, the player may organize and view his or her collected Pokémon, and in Colosseum, Pokémon may be used in battle. FireRed and LeafGreen are also the first games in the series to be compatible with the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which comes prepackaged with the games. The adapter can be plugged into the link port of the Game Boy Advance system and allows players within a radius of 30–50 feet (9–15 meters) to wirelessly interact with each other. In addition, as many as 30players at a time may join a special location called the [...] "Union Room", where they can trade, battle, or chat.

50|$|The Game Boy Micro <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> is {{functionally}} {{the same}} as the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter.</b> The only difference between the two varieties is that the Game Boy Micro <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> is made to fit the Game Boy Micro's smaller link cable port, and will therefore not fit other Game Boy models or the e-Reader. However, the <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter</b> for the Game Boy Advance and the one for the Micro do communicate with each other, making wireless connectivity possible between the two systems. The Micro version of the <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter</b> is compatible with the same Game Boy Advance games as the GBA version of the adapter.|$|E
50|$|A major {{drawback}} of the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{is that it}} is not backwards compatible; that is, it {{will only}} work with games that have been programmed to support the <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter,</b> excluding all older model Game Boy games. As of July 2009, only about 30 Game Boy Advance games support the <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter,</b> and many of the few supported games are the bit Generations series (Japan only) and the Classic NES Series.|$|E

The range of this adapter is short {{compared to the}} built-in wireless function of the Nintendo DS; Nintendo recommends players stay within 10 ft. (about 3m) of each other for best results. [...] Note that due to the Game Boy Micro's different style link cable port, the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> will not attach to it. However, a Game Boy Micro <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter</b> is available for the Game Boy Micro which is compatible for linking with the Game Boy Advance <b>Wireless</b> <b>Adapter.</b> [...] Neither <b>wireless</b> <b>adapter</b> can connect with the Nintendo DS since the DS does not support multiplayer mode in Game Boy Advance games.|$|E
