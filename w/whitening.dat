5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal <b>whitening,</b> which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), <b>whitening</b> of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the <b>whitening</b> caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E

25|$|Many toothpastes make <b>whitening</b> claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same {{ingredient}} found in tooth bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains. <b>Whitening</b> toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, <b>whitening</b> toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate {{to break down}} or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, <b>whitening</b> toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. <b>Whitening</b> toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth <b>whitening</b> gels represent an alternative. However, the <b>whitening</b> process can permanently reduce {{the strength of the}} teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.|$|E

25|$|Some skin <b>whitening</b> {{products}} {{contain the}} toxic mercury(II) chloride as the active ingredient. When applied, the chemical readily absorbs {{through the skin}} into the bloodstream. The use of mercury in cosmetics is illegal in the United States. However, cosmetics containing mercury are often illegally imported. Following a certified case of mercury poisoning resulting {{from the use of}} an imported skin <b>whitening</b> product, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of such products. Symptoms of mercury poisoning have resulted from the use of various mercury-containing cosmetic products. The use of skin <b>whitening</b> products is especially popular amongst Asian women. In Hong Kong in 2002, two products were discovered to contain between 9,000 and 60,000 times the recommended dose.|$|E
25|$|Tooth <b>whitening</b> or tooth {{bleaching}} procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the <b>whitening</b> agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that <b>whitening</b> does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

25|$|Blunt trauma causes {{swelling}}, thickening, and <b>whitening</b> of {{the lens}} fibers. While the swelling normally resolves with time, the white color may remain. In severe blunt trauma, or in injuries that penetrate the eye, the capsule in which the lens sits can be damaged. This damage allows fluid {{from other parts of}} the eye to rapidly enter the lens leading to swelling and then <b>whitening,</b> obstructing light from reaching the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts may develop in 0.7 to 8.0% of cases following electrical injuries. Blunt trauma can also result in star- or petal-shaped cataracts.|$|E

40|$|The Hartley {{transform}} is {{a mathematical}} transformation which {{is closely related}} to the better known Fourier transform. The properties that differentiate the Hartley Transform from its Fourier counterpart are that the forward and the inverse transforms are identical and also that the Hartley transform of a real signal is a real function of frequency. The <b>Whitened</b> Hartley spectrum, which stems from the Hartley transform, is a bounded function that encapsulates the phase content of a signal. The <b>Whitened</b> Hartley spectrum, unlike the Fourier phase spectrum, is a function that does not suffer from discontinuities or wrapping ambiguities. An overview on how the <b>Whitened</b> Hartley spectrum encapsulates the phase content of a signal more efficiently compared with its Fourier counterpart as well as the reason that phase unwrapping is not necessary for the <b>Whitened</b> Hartley spectrum, are provided in this study. Moreover, in this study, the product–convolution relationship, the time-shift property and the power spectral density function of the Hartley transform are presented. Finally, a short-time analysis of the <b>Whitened</b> Hartley spectrum as well as the considerations related to the estimation of the phase spectral content of a signal via the Hartley transform, are elaborated...|$|R
