Water depth reduction, increasing <b>water</b> <b>salinity</b> to saturation level {{and the appearance of}} vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever increasing demands for inadequate fresh water sources in the basin.

25|$|Care {{should be}} taken when {{consuming}} oysters. Purists insist on eating them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with a home-made Mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include: Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in <b>water</b> <b>salinity,</b> alkalinity, and mineral/nutritional content influence their flavor profile.|$|E

25|$|The {{varieties}} {{of the forests}} that exist in Sundarbans include mangrove scrub, littoral forest, saltwater mixed forest, brackish water mixed forest and swamp forest. Besides the forest, there are extensive areas of brackish water and freshwater marshes, intertidal mudflats, sandflats, sand dunes with typical dune vegetation, open grassland on sandy soils and raised areas supporting a variety of terrestrial shrubs and trees. Since Prain's report there have been considerable changes in the status of various mangrove species and taxonomic revision of the man-grove flora. However, very little exploration of the botanical nature of the Sundarbans {{has been made to}} keep up with these changes. Differences in vegetation have been explained in terms of freshwater and low salinity influences in the Northeast and variations in drainage and siltation. The Sundarbans has been classified as a moist tropical forest demonstrating a whole mosaic of seres, comprising primary colonisation on new accretions to more mature beach forests. Historically vegetation types have been recognised in broad correlation with varying degrees of <b>water</b> <b>salinity,</b> freshwater flushing and physiography.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is to evaluate the IOR potential for the NorneField’s E-segment using low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection. Sea water/high salinity waterwas injected into this formation in the past. The Norne Field’s E-Segment has produced about 40 % of the oil in place so far afteremploying the combination of primary and sea water flooding as a secondary recovery technique {{for a period of}} 7 years of production (i. e. from 6 November 1997 to 1 December 2004). There is about 60 % oil is still trapped as residual oil especially in the Ile and Tofte formations which take hold of about 80 % of oil in the reservoir. The oil trapped as a result of high capillary action of water which keeps this oil immobile. Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection could be an effective recovery mechanism to extract this residual oil from the reservoir. For the modeling of low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection for the Norne Field’s E-Segment, low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> is injected from 1 January 2005 as tertiary recovery method using ECLIPSE 100 reservoir simulator and the simulation is ended on 1 December 2022. Simulation studies using the original wells shown that low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection with optimal concentration of salinity 1, 000 ppm TDS (Total Dissolved Salts) or 1. 0 kg/m 3 revealed substantially higher oil production (34. 13 MSCM) compared to seawater/high <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection (32. 95 MSCM). Having found that the low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection is an effective IOR technique for the Norne Field’s E-Segment, the next job was to find the different ways to extractmore oil using low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection. For extracting more oil there are six significant different simulations have been run using different well configurations including base case such as; (1) Base case/sea water injection using the existing or the original wells (i. e. twoinjectors: F- 1 H & F- 3 H and two producers: E- 2 H & E- 3 AH), (2) Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection using the original wells, (3) Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection using the original wells in addition to a new producing well PROD- 1 H, (4) Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection using the original wells in addition to recompleted producing well E- 3 AH, (5) Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection using the original wells in addition to a new injection wellINJ- 1 H, and (6) Low <b>salinity</b> <b>water</b> injection using the original wells in addition to recompleted injection well F- 3 H. </p...|$|R
