5|$|Opened in April 2013, the <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> Center in the Tulsa Arts District is Tulsa's newest {{museum and}} archive. In {{addition}} to interactive state-of-the-art museum displays, the <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> Center also houses the <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> Archives, containing thousands of Guthrie's personal items, sheet music, manuscripts, books, photos, periodicals, {{and other items}} associated with the iconic Oklahoma native. The archives of Guthrie protégé, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan will also be displayed in Tulsa when a new facility designed to showcase The Bob Dylan Archive is completed.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is one {{of several}} tribute albums for American folk singer-songwriter <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie.</b> Guthrie died in 1967 after an {{extended}} battle with Huntington's disease, but his abbreviated career helped to inspire innumerable musicians during his lifetime {{as well as in the}} 1960s folk revival movement. Initially, this project was announced as a Farrar solo album with Johnson as a contributor. It was intended to follow previous efforts to elaborate on the archives of the Foundation by Billy Bragg and Wilco with the albums Mermaid Avenue (1998) and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II (2000), Blackfire's <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> Singles (2003), Jonatha Brooke's The Works (2008), and the various artists compilation Note of Hope: A Celebration of <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> (2011). Farrar was initially invited to collaborate with Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue sessions in 1995, but felt uncomfortable working on the material with someone else. Warner Bros. Records wanted all of Son Volt to collaborate with Bragg, but after Farrar declined, he kept the idea in mind. In 2006, he approached Nora Guthrie about returning to her father's lyrics and she agreed.|$|E
50|$|The Foundation was {{previously}} based in Brooklyn, New York {{and directed by}} <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie's</b> daughter Nora Guthrie. Nora Guthrie opened up the Foundation's archives to musicians of many types, who she encouraged to write and record music for the many hundreds of <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie's</b> written lyrics. Following <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie's</b> death, many of these lyrics were without surviving melodies, as Woody did not write musical notation and never recorded (or taught anyone) {{the majority of his}} original compositions.|$|R

5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie.</b> Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie,</b> {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. Charley was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was {{also a member of the}} Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that Charley was a Klansman.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Carradine earned {{critical}} {{praise for}} {{his portrayal of}} folksinger <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> in Hal Ashby's Bound for Glory (1976) for which he won a National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.

Carradine worked very closely with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist Guthrie Thomas, on the Bound for Glory film. Thomas assisted Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film itself.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

5|$|Jansch {{was brought}} up in the {{residential}} area of Edinburgh known as West Pilton, where he attended Pennywell Primary School and Ainslie Park Secondary School. As a teenager, he acquired a guitar and started visiting a local folk club ("The Howff") run by Roy Guest. There, he met Archie Fisher and Jill Doyle (Davey Graham's half-sister), who introduced him to the music of Big Bill Broonzy, Pete Seeger, Brownie McGhee and <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie.</b> He also met and shared a flat with Robin Williamson, who remained a friend when Jansch later moved to London.|$|E
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie,</b> Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is a <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> tribute album {{performed}} by Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of Guthrie's birth, released through Rounder Records on February 28, 2012. The project was initiated by Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add music to her father's lyrics—specifically, his earliest songwriting years in Los Angeles. Over {{the course of several}} years, he invited the others to collaborate and recorded at a variety of locations across the United States. Each artist wrote music to lyrics that inspired him and presented it to the collaborators for recording. The result is an album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.|$|E
5|$|After {{his parents}} {{separated}} {{when he was}} ten, Beck stayed {{with his mother and}} brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene—all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside folk until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and he quickly learned to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate the country-blues guitarist's finger picking techniques. Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering <b>Woody</b> <b>Guthrie</b> and Blind Willie Johnson.|$|E
