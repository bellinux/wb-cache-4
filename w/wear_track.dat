40|$|Carbon nitride (CNx) {{coatings}} {{are thought}} to have good tribological properties because of low friction and high wear resistance. This material shows a friction coefficient lower than 0. 01 when slid against a Si 3 N 4 ball in dry N 2 gas. The mechanism of superlow friction was believed to be due to the change in the topmost layer of the CNx surface in the <b>wear</b> <b>track</b> to a low-shear-strength layer by forming a graphite-like structure. However, the effects of nitrogen atoms in the CNx coating and the ambient N 2 gas on the transformation of the surface layers of CNx remain unclear. In this work, we investigated the relationship between the friction coefficient and the nitrogen concentration in the <b>wear</b> <b>track</b> on the CNx coating. We measured the intensity of C KLL and N KLL on the <b>wear</b> <b>track</b> of CNx by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and conducted Raman analysis.

40|$|Based on the {{well-known}} pin-on-disc test rig, a new test set-up {{has been developed}} for the online measurement of the wear and friction of steel sliding against polymer matrix composite. Instead of the standard composite specimen and steel disc, a rotating composite disc and steel pin are used. This new test set-up is used to investigate the wear and frictional behaviour of carbon fibre reinforced (Poly phenylene sulphide) PPS. The material used is a 5 -harness satin weave carbon/PPS composite with a carbon content of 50 ± 3 %. The mating surface of the pin is the ball of a ball bearing, with a radius of 8 mm, and a well-known roughness. The frictional behaviour of this material pair results in a friction coefficient of 0. 33, while a carbon film is formed in the <b>wear</b> <b>track.</b> This results in a lowering of the frictional behaviour. The wear rate is rather low, but when the <b>wear</b> <b>track</b> {{is covered with a}} carbon film suddenly the wear rate raises.

Moreover, the wear of the pin is strongly related to the <b>wear</b> <b>track.</b> The pin is flattened at the sides of the formed <b>wear</b> <b>track,</b> but in contact with the carbon film there is less wear, resulting in a pin with two flat sides, making contact with the original surface, and a rig in the middle of the pin following the roundness of the <b>wear</b> <b>track.</b> It can be stated that although the high contact pressure at the beginning resulted in plastic deformation of the PPS matrix, once a carbon film is formed the composite material is protected, resulting in the severe wear of the steel counter face...|$|E

Pin-on-disc experiments were performed at room temperature and at elevated temperature (600 °C) to understand the material behavior between mild and severe wear regimes. The wear tracks developing between the two ceramics, alumina (Al 2 O 3) and zirconia (Y-TZP), were analyzed using these techniques. The results of confocal height sensor showed significantly more geometrical changes in surface roughness at 600 °C compared to the test conducted at room temperature.
