5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990. After creating films {{which focused on}} the lives of gangsters, director John Woo <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.|$|E

5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew the personal and societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|After the Tour of Life, Bush <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{two more}} albums before touring again.

5|$|Another story {{involving}} Kaali is her escapade {{with a band}} of thieves. The thieves <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{human sacrifice}} to Kaali, and unwisely chose a saintly Brahmin monk as their victim.

The director was soon dismissed from Emperor and told that Paramount was not making The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson.

5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty {{shots with}} computer-generated imagery. Alfredson <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them very subtle and almost unnoticeable.

The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with {{a greater emphasis on}} the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Audition was {{originally}} {{started by the}} Japanese company Omega Project, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a horror film after the great financial success of their previous production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Ryu Murakami's book Audition, and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, {{with the exception of}} Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to beginning a career in film. The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a documentary on this less well-known subject, {{but the lack of}} enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, {{started to}} {{assemble}} their troops near the peasants' camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania.

The young noblemen {{who joined the}} campaign <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sudden assault on the peasants, but the bishop suggested that the peasants should be pacified through negotiations.

5|$|Burton set Mars Attacks! up with Warner Bros. and {{the studio}} {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} trading card series on his behalf. The original theatrical release date was planned for the summer of 1996. Gems completed his original script in 1994, which was budgeted by Warner Bros. at $260 million. The studio <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film {{for no more than}} $60 million.

5|$|During April 1887, J.I.

Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{film about}} the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
