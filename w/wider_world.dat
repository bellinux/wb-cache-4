5|$|The Seaforth's royalist inclinations led to Lewis {{becoming}} garrisoned {{during the}} Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway and in 1645 Lewismen fought on the royalist {{side at the}} Battle of Auldearn.

She also supports the Love Our Children USA organization, which fights violence against children, who named her among their Mothers Who Make a Difference, in 2009. She was the 2009 national spokesperson for the Light the Night Walk, which benefits the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{experience}} at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, {{yet it was}} not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ocean's lyrics {{deal with}} themes of love, longing, misgiving, and nostalgia. His debut single [...] "Novacane" [...] juxtaposes the {{numbness}} and artificiality {{of a sexual}} relationship with that of mainstream radio, while [...] "Voodoo" [...] merges themes of spirituality and sexuality, and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" [...] and the female anatomy in its chorus: [...] "she's got the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in her juicy fruit / he's got the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in his pants / he wrapped the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in a wedding band / then put the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> on her hands / she's got the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in her hands / he's got the whole <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in his hands." [...] Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love. Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has [...] "staked out ground where [...] not competing with those hit-driven [...] acts" [...] and is [...] "cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly)." ...|$|R

5|$|The intense {{international}} exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende and Damião de Góis, {{a friend of}} Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Dürer to the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b> There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after {{the arrival of the}} wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{earliest}} recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the <b>wider</b> <b>world</b> of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.|$|E
5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the <b>wider</b> <b>world</b> – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E

5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the <b>wider</b> <b>world</b> and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' {{arrival in}} the United States in 1964 marked the spread of Beatlemania from the UK to the <b>wider</b> <b>world,</b> {{established}} the group's international stature, and, triggering the British Invasion, caused changes in U.S. popular culture. The Candlestick Park concert {{at the close of}} the 1966 U.S. tour marked the end of a four-year period dominated by touring and concerts, including nearly sixty U.S. appearances, and over one thousand four hundred internationally. The Beatles, from the end of their 1966 U.S. tour until their break-up in 1970, gave no further commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E
5|$|The Economy of Scotland had an {{estimated}} nominal {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) of up to £152 billion in 2015. In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP {{was one of the}} highest in the EU. Scotland has a Western-style open mixed economy closely linked {{with the rest of the}} UK and the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b> Traditionally, the Scottish economy has been dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland.|$|E

50|$|In later years, {{with the}} rise of cable {{television}} offering more outlets for sports programming, <b>Wide</b> <b>World</b> of Sports lost many of the events that had been staples of the program for many years (many, although not all, of them ended up on ESPN, a sister network to ABC for most of its existence). Ultimately, on January 3, 1998, Jim McKay announced that <b>Wide</b> <b>World</b> of Sports, in its traditional anthology series, had been canceled after a 37-year run. The <b>Wide</b> <b>World</b> of Sports name remained in use afterward as an umbrella title for ABC's weekend sports programming.|$|R
5|$|The area {{now called}} England was first {{inhabited}} by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but takes {{its name from}} the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century, and since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b> The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law – the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world – developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels in the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b> She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who {{are unaware of}} her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century, {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman legions, Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley from Brittany and founded the monastery of Illtud on the Ogney Brook, and a college, close to the current St Illtyd's Church, about a mile from the sea. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but some sources indicate around the year 500; the blue plaque on the church today also gives this date. Because of its monastery and teaching centre it became a major centre for education and Celtic Church evangelism, attracting scholars from across Wales, Devon, Cornwall and Brittany and the <b>wider</b> <b>world.</b> The college of Llantwit, known as the College or Seminary of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws in Welsh) or College of St. Illtyd, at its peak reputedly had seven halls, over 400 houses and over 2000 students, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, the bard Taliesin, Gildas the historian, Samson of Dol, Paulinus, Bishop of Leon; St. David is believed to have spent some time there. Samson was known to have been summoned by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall. King Hywel ap Rhys (d. 886) was buried at the monastery.|$|E
