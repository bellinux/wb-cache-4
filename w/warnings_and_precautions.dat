2500|$|The monsoon {{can begin}} any time from mid-June to late July, {{with an average}} start date around July 3. It {{typically}} continues through August and sometimes into September. During the monsoon, the humidity {{is much higher than}} the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have [...] "feet of water" [...] scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, the so-called [...] "Stupid Motorist Law", was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up to $2000 for costs involved in rescuing them. Despite all <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions,</b> however, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 and 2010.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{detection}} of arbitrary static objects in traffic scenes from monocular video using structure from motion. A camera in a moving vehicle observes the road course ahead. The camera translation in depth is known. Many structure from motion algorithms were proposed for detecting moving or nearby objects. However, detecting stationary distant obstacles in the focus of expansion remains quite challenging due to very small subpixel motion between frames. In this work the scene depth is estimated from the scaling of supervised image regions. We generate obstacle hypotheses from these depth estimates in image space. A second step then performs testing of these by comparing with the counter hypothesis of a free driveway. The approach can detect obstacles already at distances of 50 m and more with a standard focal length. This early detection allows driver <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>precaution</b> in good time. ...|$|R
40|$|Among aseries of 388 shunt operations, subdual hematoma {{occurred}} in 8 cases (2. 1 %). It {{occurred in}} {{both children and}} adults, in 5 low- and 3 medium-pressure shunt systems, on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides to a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in 3 and 4 casea, respectively, and 1 in a lumbo-peritoneal shunt. Preceding subdural effusion was noted in 7 cases. Symptoms,duration and character of the hematoma {{were similar to those}} of chronic subdural hematoma. Symptoms tended to be rather mild and were compensated by a shunt system. Furthermore, removal of the hematoma in three cases required additional procedures such as ligation of the shunt, replacement to a higher-pressure valve or a subdural-peritoneal shunt for reexpansion of the brain. One case of cranio-cerebral disproportion required the reduction cranioplasty for prevention of hematoma recurrence. Promting factors were thought to be low intracranial pressure resulted from the shunt system or the pumping valve, head and individual anatomical susceptibility. Subdural effusion after a shunt operation should be regarded as a <b>warning</b> sign, <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> should be taken against occurrence of chronic subdural hematoma. To prevent this complication, addition of an anti-siphon device is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amount of wildlife mortality and traffic rates in Khojir National Park, and with regard to that, finding a suitable location for installing signs according to the standard level sign structure. Materials and Methods: In this study, the current placement of wildlife warning signs was assessed in Khojir National Park, 2010, Tehran, Iran and a method to optimize warning sign placement using kernel density estimations was developed based on existing records for wildlife-vehicle accidents. Kernel density estimation is one of the best methods for finding a suitable location for installing the signs. The most promising of these tools is kernel density estimation, at first with questioner has found nearly point and after that with GPS try to register them in visual page. With kernel density prove to find the best radius, because of installing the sign. Results: Finally in this project, the best radius was found to be 50 m from one accident point, because of supporting the optimum location for installing signs, and finding the four points for installing the signs, and for designing wildlife signs using the symbol of maximum species that was injured in vehicle collision. Conclusion: Finding an area for installing wildlife, the designing of <b>warning</b> signs, <b>and</b> other <b>precautions</b> such as wildlife crossings and overpass creation are useful in decreasing wildlife accidents...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe precautionary {{principle}} {{has been the}} subject of a heated debate in recent months in France, not least because it was mentioned in the Environmental Charter discussed by the French Parliament in 2005, and included in the French constitution.

The Committee for Prevention <b>and</b> <b>Precaution</b> (CPP) is an advisory body to the French Ministry of the Environment (now Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development), which was created by a Ministerial Decree on 30 July 1996 with the aim of contributing to giving sound foundations to the Ministry's policies in matters related to risk prevention and precaution; detecting, <b>and</b> providing <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> expertise on health issues related to disruptions in the environment; and creating a linkage between scientific research and knowledge on one hand, and regulatory action on the other.
