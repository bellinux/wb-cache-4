500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you <b>will.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, Lopez {{received}} a demo {{of a song}} called [...] "Big Booty", produced by Diplo, and was encouraged to record the track, with everybody indicating {{that it was the}} type of track she needed to do. However, Lopez claimed: [...] "Never in my life <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a song called 'Big Booty', it would never happen," [...] explaining that she felt {{it was going to be}} a joke and the album was very important. After some reluctance, Lopez ended up writing the track and played the demo in her car to see if it would work. While playing some tracks in her car, with her twins, Lopez stated that they instantly loved that the track: [...] "As soon as they heard 'Big Booty' they went crazy. They loved this song and because of that I recorded it," [...] she admitted. During a brunch where she debuted multiple songs from A.K.A., Lopez spoke of the track, saying: [...] "I didn't allow myself to be put in a box. On this album, I did all of it. This is who I am and i have to embrace all of that and be as honest as I can be." ...|$|E
