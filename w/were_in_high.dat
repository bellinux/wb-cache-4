5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed of horse used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E

5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand. Prior {{to the first}} day of ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand. In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms was so great that many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E

5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} high status, running a large business enterprise. By mid-life she was an independently wealthy woman, connected across England to rich and powerful men in government and the court. Her network of services <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand, counter to the religious and social morals of the day.|$|E
5|$|Luxury items <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand {{among the}} {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, {{and to a}} lesser degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture. The Altar of Veit Stoss in St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków {{is one of the most}} magnificent art works of its kind in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous Serbian realists of the late 19th century. From 1877 to 1882, he {{attended}} Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, studying under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In the early part of his career, he composed mostly Orientalist paintings, which <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West.|$|E

5|$|The Yamashiro {{tradition}} was {{centered around the}} capital Kyoto in Yamashiro Province where swords <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand. Sanjō Munechika (c. 987) was a forerunner of this tradition, and the earliest identified smith working in Kyoto. Various branches of the Yamashiro tradition are distinguished: Sanjō, Awataguchi, Rai, Ayanokoji, Nobukuni, Hasebe and Heian-jo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years as they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, {{many of which were}} commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{became a}} {{province}} of the Roman Empire in 30BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand in Rome.|$|E
5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West. In the late 1880s, Jovanović turned to history painting, depicting scenes from the history of the Serb people, as seen in The Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E

5|$|Her skills <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> {{demand and}} she formed many collaborations in Vienna, working with Ewald Schmidt on the {{modification}} of 's method of vaporizing polonium; with Marietta Blau on photographic emulsions of hydrogen rays; and with Hans Pettersson. In 1928, Pettersson {{asked her to}} analyze a sample of sea bottom sediment to determine its radium content. Because the lab she was working in was contaminated, she took the samples to the oceanographic laboratory at Bornö Marine Research Station on Stora Bornö in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden, which would become her summer research destination for the next 12 years. Her analyses with Berta Karlik on the half-lives of uranium, thorium, and actinium decay identified radiometric dating and elemental alpha particle ranges. In 1933, Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences Haitinger Prize.|$|E
5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he {{expected}} to be fired {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> spirits. Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. In the locker room after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff contention and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E
