5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of me personally.

5|$|While {{previous}} {{games in}} the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence, and rebuttal phases, in which they confront other characters, to hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> has happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters' statements, {{to get closer to}} the truth.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer.

25|$|The game {{is usually}} self-refereed, {{relying on the}} players to call their own infractions {{and to try to}} play within the rules of the game.

After a call is made, the players should decide on an outcome, based on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If a player has been fouled on a catch, they will often gain possession of the disc. If the players cannot agree on a catching foul, the disc can be given back to the thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw.|$|E
