5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions {{that the goal of}} the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.|$|E
5|$|Born in Canada, Naismith studied {{physical}} education at McGill University in Montreal {{before moving to}} the United States, where he designed the game in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Seven years after inventing basketball, Naismith received his medical degree in Denver in 1898. He then arrived at the University of Kansas, later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks' athletic director and coach. While a coach at Kansas, Naismith coached Phog Allen, who later became the coach at Kansas for 39 seasons, beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree. Allen then went on to coach legends including Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith, among others, <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> coached many notable players and future coaches.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Big Four {{held the}} top four places in the rankings for a whole {{calendar}} {{year for the first}} time. This also prompted the first uses of the term 'Big Four' to refer to the players, although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> were still regarded ahead {{of the rest of the}} tour. At the Australian Open, Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic, obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer, while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on. Nadal continued to dominate early in the season, but suffered from injury in June, allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season. Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins, taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open, thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments, and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively. Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|York {{dropped into}} the relegation zone after a 1–0 away defeat to Grays, <b>who</b> <b>themselves</b> {{moved out of the}} relegation zone and above York, and this was {{followed}} with a 0–0 home draw with Oxford. They were beaten 2–1 at home by Northwich; Jonny Allan gave the visitors the lead {{in the first half and}} Robinson equalised with a penalty on 68 minutes, before Allan scored a stoppage-time winner for Northwich. This was followed by a 0–0 draw away to fellow strugglers Barrow. Before York's penultimate home match against Eastbourne, Parslow was named the 2008–09 Clubman of the Year, voted for by the club's supporters. A 1–0 victory saw York move out of the relegation zone, in what was their first league win in 10 matches. It was achieved after McBreen scored from a Purkiss pass in the 35th minute. A second successive win came at home to Forest Green, who York beat 2–1 with second-half goals from Boyes and Brodie.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between spirituality and locus of control using similar definitions and processes of previous research on the topic. This cross comparison of participants <b>who</b> categorize <b>themselves</b> into different groups of spirituality allows for the examination of how people of various spiritual groups {{can be described as}} having an internal or external locus of control. Items from questionnaires completed by an undergraduate population were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to examine the direct relationship between the variables. A significant difference between the groups of participants of differing spiritualities and their locus of control was found. Participants <b>who</b> consider <b>themselves</b> atheists were found to have higher levels of internal locus of control versus participants <b>who</b> labeled <b>themselves</b> agnostic, unsure, spiritual, religious, or a combination of labels. Participants <b>who</b> described <b>themselves</b> as agnostic, unsure, spiritual, religious, or a combination of levels were found to have higher levels of external locus of control versus those <b>who</b> described <b>themselves</b> as atheists. These results offer support for past research and open opportunities for the continuance of studying aspects of {{the relationship between}} spirituality and locus of control...|$|R
