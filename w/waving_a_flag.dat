25|$|Less successfully, the 11 {{survivors}} of the Spirit of the Dawn (out of a crew of 16) failed to find the depots after foundering on a reef off the Antipodes Islands in 1893. (The island is mountainous and their weakened physical state prevented them searching the island for the depots.) However, they subsisted on raw muttonbirds, mussels and roots, and after 87 days, they sighted a patrolling government steamer Hinemoa {{and were able to}} attract its attention by <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> made from their sail.|$|E
25|$|Modern F1 {{cars and}} other {{high-end}} formula racing cars have information displays on their steering wheels which can flash up the word flag to warn drivers when they are entering a sector with a local yellow. Most new circuits and older ones used for F1 employ trackside flashing lights at regular intervals, as a clearer way to signal yellow, green, red, blue or SC flag status to drivers than relying on them to spot a marshal <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag,</b> especially so on modern circuits where there are large run-off areas which put the marshals {{well away from the}} actual track.|$|E

25|$|When the spout of a whale was sighted, the {{watchman}} {{alerted the}} men by burning some straw, beating a drum, ringing a bell or <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> Once alerted, men launched small rowing boats from the beach, or, if the shoreline was steep, the boats were {{held by a}} capstan and launched by releasing the rope attached to the boats. The whale was struck with a two-flued harpoon (as shown in the seal of Hondarribia, dated 1297), lanced, and killed. A larger boat manned by ten men towed the carcass ashore, waiting for high tide to beach the whale, where it was flensed. The blubber was then brought to a boiling house where it was rendered into oil.|$|E
500|$|... "Loverboy" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics; many called the song unoriginal and dated while others {{felt that the}} featured artists (primarily on the remix version) overpowered Carey and made the song disorganized. A music video, directed by David LaChapelle, was shot for both versions of the song. The first version features Carey as a scantily-clad car girl, <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> as her loverboy finishes a race. The video for the remix version features similar footage, only including shots of the song's guests in race-cars during their verses. Finally, she performed [...] "Loverboy" [...] live on The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour in 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Van Ornum {{located a}} small group of Shoshone warriors being led by Chief Bear Hunter. [...] He and McGarry's men {{followed}} the Shoshone as they retreated to nearby Providence Canyon. [...] After the Indians opened fire, McGarry gave the order [...] "to commence firing and to kill every Indian they could see." [...] A skirmish between the Shoshone and the U.S. Army lasted for about two hours after the Shoshone established a defensible position in the canyon. [...] Finally Chief Bear Hunter signaled surrender by climbing a foothill and <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> of truce.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second set}} was {{interrupted}} with Söderling serving on {{serve in the}} fourth game, when {{a member of the}} crowd charged onto the court and ran towards Federer <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> and placing a jesters hat upon the Swiss player's head. The fan then evaded security and leapt over the net and ran towards Söderling before being tackled by a security guard and removed from the court. This was a serious violation, especially following the on-court stabbing of Monica Seles by a spectator in 1993. Following the interruption both players held serve in the set and it went to a tiebreaker. Federer then played what he later described as the greatest tiebreaker of his career, taking it by a score of 7–1.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the war, American {{soldiers}} and other witnesses sent letters home which described {{some of the}} atrocities committed by American forces. For example, In November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger wrote: [...] "The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog..." [...] Reports were received from soldiers returning from the Philippines that, upon entering a village, American soldiers would ransack every house and church and rob the inhabitants of everything of value, while those who approached the battle line <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> of truce were fired upon.|$|E

2500|$|Around 5:30p.m., Jackson's 21,500 men {{exploded}} out of {{the woods}} screaming the infamous bloodcurdling [...] "Rebel Yell". Most of the men of the XI Corps were encamped and sitting down for supper and had their rifles unloaded and stacked. Their first clue to the impending onslaught was the observation of numerous animals, such as rabbits and foxes, fleeing in their direction {{out of the}} western woods. After the division of Brig. Gen. Charles Devens, Jr., collapsed, Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz ordered his division to shift from an east-west alignment to north-south, which they did with amazing precision and speed. However, they were overlapped significantly on both sides by the Confederate onslaught and Schurz ordered a retreat at 6:30p.m. General Howard partially redeemed his inadequate performance prior to the battle by his personal bravery in attempting to rally the troops. He stood shouting and <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> held under the stump of his amputated arm (lost at the Battle of Seven Pines in 1862), ignoring the danger of the heavy rifle fire, but he could only gather small pockets of soldiers to resist before his corps disintegrated. Several thousand of Howard's men gathered at Fairview, a clearing across the road from the Chancellor mansion, where 37 clustered guns of the XII Corps artillery brought Rodes's now-disorganized division to a standstill at 7:15. Hooker urged the III Corps division of Maj. Gen. Hiram G. Berry to defend a line a half mile from Chancellorsville with their bayonets, but by that time, the momentum of the attack had passed.|$|E

60|$|During {{the next}} thirty hours the steady towing was {{interrupted}} once. At {{a signal from}} the brig, made by <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> on the forecastle, the gunboat was stopped. The badly-stuffed specimen of a warrant-officer, getting into his boat, arrived on board the Neptun and hurried straight into his commander's cabin, his excitement at something he had to communicate being betrayed by the blinking of his small eyes. These two were closeted together for some time, while Jasper at the taffrail tried to make out if {{anything out of the}} common had occurred on board the brig.|$|E

60|$|Up {{and down}} the street {{mischief}} was afoot. Outside the Rand Club in the cross street a considerable mass of people had accumulated, and was being hustled by a handful of khaki-clad soldiers. Down the street people were looking {{in the direction of the}} market-place and then suddenly a rush of figures flooded round the corner, first a froth of scattered individuals and then a mass, a column, marching with an appearance of order and <b>waving</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> It was a poorly disciplined body, it fringed out into a swarm of sympathizers and spectators upon the side walk, and at the head of it two men disputed. They seemed to be differing about the direction of the whole crowd. Suddenly one smote the other with his fist, a blow that hurled him sideways, and then turned with a triumphant gesture to the following ranks, waving his arms in the air. He was a tall lean man, hatless and collarless, greyhaired and wild-eyed. On he came, gesticulating gauntly, past the hotel.|$|E

2500|$|People threw Ceaușescu's writings, {{official}} {{portraits and}} propaganda books out the windows, intending to burn them.

25|$|Most of {{the stages}} in the race are usually mass-start stages, with the whole peloton {{starting}} together. Mass-start stages begin in different towns with a send off to gain publicity, the riders ride without racing. The riders then ride a few kilometers around the stage's start town before reaching kilometer zero, where the race director then <b>waves</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> to start the stage's racing. Once the flag is waved there are usually attacks by the riders to form a breakaway.|$|R
