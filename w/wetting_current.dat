40|$|Electrowetting is a {{phenomenon}} that controls the wettability of liquids on solid surfaces by the application of electric potential. It is an interesting method to handle tiny amounts of liquid on solid surfaces. In recent times, researchers have been investigating this phenomenon and have reported some unexplained behavior and degradation in the Electrowetting system performance. Electrowetting systems include the presence of electric field and different materials from metals to dielectrics and electrolytes that create {{an environment in which}} corrosion processes play a very important role. With the small dimensions of the electrodes, corrosion can cause failure quickly when the dielectric fails. In this work, commonly used dielectric films such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were deposited using Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition and characterized on the basis of thickness uniformity, etch rate measurements, Dry current – voltage measurements and <b>Wet</b> <b>current</b> – voltage measurements. Sputtered silicon dioxide films were also characterized using the same methods.

More specifically, materials exhibiting extreme wetting properties, such as superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces, have attracted considerable attention because of their potential use in various applications, such as self-cleaning fabrics, anti-fog windows, anti-corrosive coatings, drag-reduction systems, and efficient water transportation. In particular, the engineering of surface wettability by manipulating chemical properties and structure opens emerging biomedical applications ranging from high-throughput cell culture platforms to biomedical devices.

40|$|The water {{dynamics}} of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a 50 cm 2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell was studied in response to current and humidity step transients {{as a function of}} inlet relative humidity (RH) and cell operating temperature. MEA water content change was monitored by high frequency resistance (HFR) and in situ neutron imaging. The MEA “wetting ” response was significantly faster (10 - 30 seconds) than the reciprocal “drying ” response (several minutes). The wetting response to increasing current appears faster than that to increasing gas inlet RH. Wetting and drying responses to gas inlet RH transients are greater at low current densities showing the dominating effect of <b>current</b> <b>wetting</b> over gas inlet humidity effects. Operating the fuel cell at 40 oC with no inlet gas humidification, a <b>current</b> <b>wetting</b> response was observed and 34 amps of current sustained. This showed that reaction water produced at the cathode is sufficient to support high current density if the drying effect of inlet gases is low. It also suggests that back diffusion of reaction water to the MEA is sufficient to account for the fast drop in HFR. In situ neutron imaging results show that GDL wetting is also faster than drying but on a slower time scale than that for the MEA. However, MEA and GDL drying are on a similar slow time scale and are coupled because water diffusing out of the MEA must move through the GDLs...|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{electronic}} equipment (brown goods), such as television sets, radio sets, and video recorders, are most common. However, recycling of consumer electronic scrap is only beginning. Characterization of TV scrap {{was carried out}} by using a variety of methods, such as chemical analysis, particle size and shape analysis, liberation degree analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, sink-float test, and IR spectrometer. A comparison of TV scrap, personal computer scrap, and printed circuit boards scrap shows that the content of non-ferrous metals and precious metals in TV scrap is much lower than in personal computer scrap or printed circuit boards scrap. It is expected that recycling of TV scrap will not be cost- effective by utilizing conventional manual disassembly. The result of particle shape analysis indicates that the non-ferrous metals particles in TV scrap formed as a variety of shapes, it is much more heterogeneous than for plastics and printed circuit boards. The results of sink-float tests demonstrate that a high recovery of copper could be obtained by an effective gravity separation process. Identification of plastics shows that the major plastic in TV scrap is high impact polystyrene. Gravity separation of plastics may encounter some challenges in separation of plastics from TV scrap because of specific density variations. Furthermore, Mechanical recycling of TV scrap oriented to recovery of non- ferrous metals is highlighted by utilizing several techniques, such as air table, eddy current separation, and optical sorting. The separation results reveal that air table separation is an effective technology to recover metals from consumer electronic scraps. By using a DGS table, approximately 90 % of non-ferrous metals were recovered in the heavy product with a purity of 40 %. Printed circuit boards and cables in TV scrap cause metals loss {{due to the fact that}} metals in printed circuit boards and cables are not liberated from plastics and ceramic materials. The study shows that eddy current separation and optical (metal) sorting process provide alternatives to recover metals from TV scraps. At last, new developments of eddy current separation, such as <b>wet</b> eddy <b>current</b> separation and Magnus separation are discussed in the thesis. A comparison of eddy current separation and Magnus separation on aluminum recovery shows that <b>wet</b> eddy <b>current</b> separation is more effective for recovery of fine non-ferrous particles.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is a retinal disease evident {{after the age}} of 50 that damages the macula in the centre of retina. It leads to a loss of central vision with retained peripheral vision but eventual blindness occurs in many cases. The initiation site of AMD development is Bruch&# 039;s membrane (BM) where multiple changes occur including the deposition of plasma derived lipids, accumulation of extracellular debris, changes in cell morphology, and viability and the formation of drusen. AMD manifests as early and late stage; the latter involves cell proliferation and neovascularization in <b>wet</b> AMD. <b>Current</b> therapies target the later hyperproliferative and invasive wet stage whilst none target early developmental stages of AMD. In the lipid deposition disease atherosclerosis modified proteoglycans bind and retain apolipoproteins in the artery wall. Chemically modified trapped lipids are immunogenic and can initiate a chronic inflammatory process manifesting as atherosclerotic plaques and subsequent artery blockages, heart attacks, or strokes. As plasma derived lipoprotein deposits are found in BM in early AMD, it is possible that they arise by a similar process within the macula.

A paleoecological investigation was conducted in Jumbo Valley, NE, in an interdunal wetland known to contain sand layers interbedded with peat. The sedimentary record in two cores is continuous, except for some loss due to surficial burns. Macrofossils indicate that the late Pleistocene was cool and <b>wet,</b> with <b>current</b> vegetation establishing around 12, 000 years ago. Sand and bulk density profiles reveal significant periods of dune activity in the intervals 9200 - 7000, 6400 - 5400, 4000 - 3000, 2700 - 2300, 2100 - 1800, and 950 - 700 calendar years before present (cal yr BP).
