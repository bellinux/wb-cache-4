500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> fitting a new cap on her mother. I {{never saw}} her look more charming.|$|E
60|$|But {{now that}} his anger was over {{he looked a little}} frightened. Felicity was not there. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> in the kitchen, {{lighting}} up the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' {{said the}} Courtiers, 'now <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>her!</b> What a {{wonderful}} power {{for such a}} small beast to have! I am sure we have heard her before!' ...|$|R
60|$|There was no moving her--there {{was nothing}} more to be said. I signed to Penelope to come away with me. We left <b>her,</b> as <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> {{sweeping}} the corridor, like {{a woman in a}} dream.|$|R
6000|$|Om-at smiled. [...] "Good!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "And when <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>her</b> <b>we</b> shall go {{together}} upon Tarzan's business and Ta-den's. Where first shall we search?" [...] He turned toward his warriors. [...] "Who knows where she may be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Contrary blasts keep a ship upright,' said Gertrude, 'and she {{has them}} in abundance. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{in the midst}} of six people, all giving {{diametrically}} opposite advice.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, thet's good.... I {{caught up}} with Dillon. Told him. He was mighty glad <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her.</b> Cussed his troopers some. Said he'd explain your absence, an' we could send over fer anythin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sire, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{sick with}} {{the sights and}} sounds of war and murder; shamed to know also that her uncle, the conquering {{sovereign}} of the East, had slaughtered two hundred unarmed men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no," [...] I {{said with}} a little shiver. [...] "I would never wear them, Aunt Winnifred. I should feel like a ghost if I did. Put {{everything}} back just as <b>we</b> <b>found</b> it--only <b>her</b> portrait. I would like to keep that." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} and no more, lifting her hand she waved him back from her, {{and went on}} her way again, as <b>we</b> had first <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> alone.|$|R
6000|$|DORA. Cardinal, indeed! If only Beatrice {{were here}} with her seven handmaids, that she might see what a fine eighth <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> for <b>her!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{treasure}} was warranted {{sober and}} honest. I am therefore {{willing to believe}} that she was in a fit when <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> under the boiler; and that the deficient tea-spoons were attributable to the dustman.|$|E
6000|$|... "She fell. Hurt her foot, had to stop, {{and then}} couldn't make good time. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> limping along, and shoved through the bush for the river, so she needn't walk. Well, I think that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{kneeling}} {{before the}} Crucifix, telling her beads; and we stood waiting {{a few moments}} in silence until with a sigh and a rustle of her stiff black dress she rose gently {{and turned to face}} us.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} told me the truth I will spare you," [...] said Korak. [...] "I shall go now to The Sheik's village and if the girl is not there I shall return and slay you. As for the other {{information}} you have, if the girl wants it when <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>her</b> <b>we</b> {{will find a way}} to purchase it from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Further {{investigation}} of the room revealed nothing which could throw any light on the purpose of our inquiry. We examined the clothes, jewelry, and books of the deceased. These we left under lock and key. <b>We</b> also <b>found</b> <b>her</b> dressing-case, which <b>we</b> protected by seals, and took away with us to the Fiscal's office, {{along with all the}} other articles that we had discovered in the room.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know,' said Mary; 'Frank and I {{were both}} very sorry, and <b>we</b> would have <b>found</b> <b>her</b> another place, {{but she would}} go home. You see, we could not keep her in the nursery, for {{we must have a}} {{thoroughly}} trustworthy person to go out with Michael.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dinner-time {{next day when}} we {{appeared}} before my aunt. She was up in my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> in her spectacles, sitting by the fire.|$|E
60|$|We searched till dawn {{about the}} house; within the house, without the house, We searched among the laurel boughs that grew beneath the wall, And then among the crocks and things, and stores for winter junketings, In linhay, loft, and dairy; but <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> not at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so. When <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> address {{among the}} truck Strange had {{left with the}} foreman, it was the proper {{thing for me to}} tell her he was drowned. This led to another letter or two, and when I said I was going to Montreal she asked me to meet her." ...|$|E
40|$|Overexpression of the HER 2 /Neu {{protooncogene}} {{has been}} linked to the progression of breast cancer. Here we demonstrate that the growth of prostate cancer LNCaP cells can also be increased by the stable transfection of HER 2 /Neu. Using AG 879, a HER 2 /Neu inhibitor, and PD 98059, a MAP kinase inhibitor, as well as MAP kinase phosphatase- 1 (MPK- 1), in the transfection assay, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>HER</b> 2 /Neu could induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a marker for the progression of prostate cancer, through the MAP kinase pathway at a low androgen level. Reporter assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays further suggest this HER 2 /Neu-induced androgen receptor (AR) transactivation may function through the promotion of interaction between AR and AR coactivators, such as ARA 70. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> this <b>HER</b> 2 /Neu → MAP kinase → AR-ARAs → PSA pathway could not be blocked completely by hydroxyflutamide, an antiandrogen used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Together, these data provide a novel pathway from HER 2 /Neu to AR transactivation, and they may represent {{one of the reasons for}} the PSA re-elevation and hormone resistance during androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer patients...|$|R
60|$|At {{the last}} conference we had held with <b>her,</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her</b> not over willing {{to lift her}} eyes from the book which she had on the table. On this {{occasion}} there was a change for the better. She met the Sergeant's eye with an eye that was as steady as his own. The family spirit showed itself in every line of her face; and I knew that Sergeant Cuff would meet his match, when a woman like my mistress was strung up to hear the worst he could say to her.|$|R
6000|$|I {{sent for}} the doctor and had her put to bed immediately. The black nurse and I undressed <b>her</b> between us. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> next <b>her</b> bosom, tied by a small red silken thread, a tiny bone, fresh and ruddy-looking. I knew what it was, {{and so did the}} negress. It was a human finger-bone--the last joint of a small child's fourth finger. The negress shuddered and hid her head. [...] "It is Vaudoux, Monsieur!" [...] she said. [...] "I have seen it on others. Madame has been paying a visit, I suppose, to her grandmother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{got back}} to the camp," [...] Laura {{continued}} rapidly, [...] "there wasn't a soul there except the Chinaman. He told me that Lenora had ridden off a few minutes before to find you. We came to look for her. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief on the road there, and that's her horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> already armed, {{for that}} day she was to ride to Jargeau, and none was with her but her confessor. She gave me the best of greetings, and bade me eat bread and drink wine. [...] "And soon," [...] she said, [...] "if you recover the quicker, I trust to give you wine to drink in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{said that}} the Amahagger had {{attacked}} the village and killed all who could not escape. They had eaten a young woman and three children. She had been wounded by a spear and fled away into the place where <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> where none of them took the trouble to follow her as she [...] "was not worth eating." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> both <b>her</b> and {{her crew}} {{to be easy}} to work with and low-key. I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I hope we can do here." ...|$|R
6000|$|But at last--not {{far from}} where <b>we</b> had parted--I <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> a pillar of smoke in the first shining of the moon. She turned large, {{smouldering}} eyes on me, her mane in elf locks, her flanks heaving and wet, her forelock frizzed like a colt's. Yet she showed only pleasure at seeing me, and so evident a desire to unburden the day's history, that I almost wished I might be Balaam awhile, and she--Dapple! ...|$|R
60|$|Disdainful of my mirth {{he merely}} muttered his basso-profundo thankfulness that <b>we</b> had not <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{anywhere}} about there. Having grown extremely sensitive (an effect of irritation) to the tonalities, I may say, of this affair, I {{felt that it}} was only an imperfect, reserved, thankfulness, with one eye still on the possibilities of the several ponds in the neighbourhood. And I remember I snorted, I positively snorted, at that poor Fyne.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{a capital}} little guide and story-teller, for her {{grandmother}} {{had told her}} all the tales and legends of the neighbourhood, {{and it was very}} pleasant to hear her repeat them in pretty peasant French, as we sat among the ruins, while Kate sketched, I took notes, and Marie held the big parasol over us.|$|E
60|$|And {{when at last}} {{we reached}} our poor Queen's apartments, {{there was not a}} spark of fire in them. She was a guest there. She had no money, and all the wood had either been used up or pillaged; and there <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> wrapped in a great fur cloak, sitting by the bed where was the little Lady Henrietta.|$|E
60|$|This {{was all the}} {{preparation}} I received for that visit, or for others like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting. We went down {{on the next day}} but one, and <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House.|$|E
40|$|New {{complete}} {{light and}} radial velocities curves {{were obtained for}} the eclipsing binaries CC Her and CM Lac. The data are analysed with modern techniques in order to derive the physical parameters of the systems and study their present evolutionary status. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that CC <b>Her</b> is a classical Algol type binary, while CM Lac is a detached system with two Main Sequence stars in asynchronous orbit.

40|$|Understanding how {{children}} perceive {{and interact with}} teachable agents (systems where children learn through teaching a synthetic character embedded in an intelligent tutoring system) can {{provide insight into the}} effects of so-cial interaction on learning with intelligent tutoring sys-tems. We describe results from a think-aloud study where children were instructed to narrate their experience teaching Stacy, an agent who can learn to solve linear equations with the student’s help. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> treating <b>her</b> as a partner, pri-marily through aligning oneself with Stacy using pronouns like you or we rather than she or it significantly correlates with student learning, as do playful face-threatening com-ments such as teasing, while elaborate explanations of Sta-cy’s behavior in the third-person and formal tutoring state-ments reduce learning gains. Additionally, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that the agent’s mistakes were a significant predictor for stu-dents shifting away from alignment with the agent.

60|$|She was by {{that time}} perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was fast {{relapsing}} into the inky condition in which <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her.</b> At one o'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our luggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good friend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me in the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps; Peepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of separation (I was not without misgivings that {{he had gone to}} Newgate market in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the barouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.|$|R
