On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine {{the purpose of the}} meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} such successes, Australian heavy metal {{continues}} {{to remain a}} fringe underground culture still widely ignored by the mainstream industry and media. When it was announced in mid-2006 that the annual Metal for the Brain festival {{would be no more}} after a final event on 4 November, no regular news service outside of Canberra carried <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> even though it had often attracted up to 3000 people and had been running as long as the Big Day Out. In an interview with Australian metal webzine , festival director Adam Agius suggested the festival would return in 2008; this now seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, a black freedman named Denmark Vesey and compatriots around Charleston {{organized}} {{a plan for}} thousands of slaves {{to participate in an}} armed uprising to gain freedom. Vesey's plan, inspired by the 1791 Haitian Revolution, called for thousands of armed black men to kill their slaveholders, seize the city of Charleston, and escape from the United States by sailing to Haiti. The plot was discovered when two slaves opposed to the plan leaked <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to white authorities. Charleston authorities charged 131 men with participating in the conspiracy. In total, the state convicted 67 men and killed 35 of them by hanging, including Denmark Vesey. White fear of slave insurrections after the Vesey conspiracy led to a 9:15pm curfew for slaves in Charleston, and the establishment of a municipal guard of 150 white men in Charleston, with half the men stationed in an arsenal called the Citadel.|$|E

500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E
500|$|By late 1863, it {{had become}} obvious to Cleburne that the Confederacy was losing the war because of the growing {{limitations}} of its manpower and resources. In 1864, he dramatically called together {{the leadership of the}} Army of Tennessee and put forth the proposal to emancipate all slaves ("emancipating the whole race upon reasonable terms, and within such reasonable time") in order to [...] "enlist their sympathies" [...] and thereby enlist them in the Confederate Army to secure Southern independence. [...] His plan did not include black equality, suggesting that legislation and foresight would ensure relations between blacks and whites would not materially change. This proposal was met with polite silence at the meeting, and while <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> leaked out, it went unremarked, much less officially recognized.

500|$|Subsequently, {{upon the}} Crusaders' arrival, {{the city was}} {{subjected}} to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on {{both sides in the}} ensuing battle. The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade the lake, which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned. [...] To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June. The city was handed over to the Byzantine troops, which has often been depicted as a source of conflict between the Empire and the crusaders; Byzantine standards flew from the walls while the crusaders were forbidden from looting the city or even entering it except in small escorted bands.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} at Vanity Fair deteriorated upon management's return. They {{sent out a}} memo forbidding the discussion of salaries {{in an attempt to}} rein in the staff. Benchley, Parker, and Sherwood responded with a memo of their own, followed by placards around their necks detailing their exact salaries for all to see. Management attempted to issue [...] "tardy slips" [...] for staff who were late. On one of these, Benchley wrote out, in very small handwriting, an elaborate excuse involving a herd of elephants on 44th Street. These issues contributed to a general deterioration of morale in the offices, culminating in Parker's termination, allegedly due to complaints by the producers of the plays she skewered in her theatrical reviews. Upon learning of her termination, Benchley tendered his own resignation. <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was published in Time by Alexander Woollcott, who was at a lunch with Benchley, Parker, and others. Given that Benchley had two children {{at the time of his}} resignation, Parker referred to it as [...] "the greatest act of friendship I'd ever seen." ...|$|E

However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on {{which turns out to}} be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, [...] "you know, for kids." [...] Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus, {{is assigned}} to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows [...] "just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker".

500|$|There was no {{nationwide}} {{election day}} in 1840, and many states, {{by the time}} they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, [...] "do not believe a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Nor will I believe that you are not elected until I see all the official returns." [...] But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.|$|E
500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand behind every <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them [...] "intransigent" [...] and stating that they [...] "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, {{settled with}} the Turcotte family, who {{stated that they}} were the basis for the Finch family portrayed in Running with Scissors. The Turcottes, who alleged that Running with Scissors was largely fictional and written in a sensational manner, sought damages of $2 million for {{invasion}} of privacy, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Burroughs defended his work as [...] "entirely accurate," [...] but agreed to call the work a [...] "book" [...] (instead of [...] "memoir") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for [...] "any unintentional harm" [...] to the Turcotte family. Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement. [...] "I'm not at all sorry that I wrote it. And you know, the suit settled – it settled in my favor.

The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season.
