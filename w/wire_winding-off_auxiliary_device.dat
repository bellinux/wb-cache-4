40|$|Introduction: Roller {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used in surgeries involving extracorporeal circulation and its regulation may influence the hemolysis rate. Objective: To describe an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>device</b> for adjusting roller pumps using the dynamic calibration method and show preliminary results of its application in surgical procedures. Method:The device was tested in the laboratory environment with three disposable pressure transducers normally used in surgeries. In the operation room, tests were carried out with two groups of patients. Free hemoglobin plasma rates were measured, 5 minutes after perfusion started and immediately before {{the passage of the}} residual volume of the pump. For Group 1 (n = 22), occlusion measurements were carried out using the drop rate method and for Group 2 (n = 18), measurements were carried out using the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>device</b> and 300 mmHg calibration (mean pressure for the dynamic calibration method).

40|$|As {{large-scale}} photovoltaic (PV) generation reaches higher penetration levels, {{there is}} a greater need to meet the certain grid code requirements for interconnection. Ultracapacitor, battery energy storage system (BESS) or shunt capacitor have recently been used as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> for large-scale PV generator system to meet the grid code requirements for interconnection. Although the individual <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> are well documented, a comparative study of these devices impact on the damping of electromechanical (EM) modes and oscillatory instability problem has not been reported so far. This paper aims to fill in the gap, and provides a comparative analysis of these <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> performance along with PV plant on the damping of EM modes. The oscillation problem is analyzed by considering different types of synchronous generator (e. g. hydro, thermal) as the non-electrical components of hydro and thermal units have major influences on system dynamics. The comparisons are based on the results obtained from two-area test system and New England-New York test system (16 machine 68 bus system), which are the benchmark systems for angular stability analysis...|$|R

30|$|A novel testbed HINT (High-Accuracy nonIntrusive Networking Testbed) is proposed. The {{test data}} are {{generated}} by <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> and transferred over additional networks in HINT.

The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> run like many smart spies. They each probe the internal interconnected signals inside a sensor node with extra tributary wires, and then transfers the accuracy test data to the testbed server over additional networks. The testbed server of HINT collect, parse and understand all the test information, and then reconstruct the sensor network behavior.|$|R
40|$|Service vehicles, such as {{refrigerator}} {{trucks and}} tour buses, {{are equipped with}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices,</b> including refrigeration systems and cabin air conditioning systems, which consume significant amount of energy. The engine of these vehicles should idle to supply power for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> when they stop for a long time, e. g. for loading and unloading goods. This study proposes a new anti-idling system for service vehicles that powers <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> by a battery pack and an engine-driven generator (or alternator). In addition to idle elimination which is the main objective of all current anti-idling systems, the proposed system called Regenerative Auxiliary Power System (RAPS) attempts {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by enabling regenerative braking and utilizing an optimal power management system. The objectives of this study are to identify drive and service loads of a service vehicle for component sizing of the RAPS and to develop an optimal power management system for more fuel saving. In order to determine the size of required components (a battery pack and a generator) for the RAPS, drive and service loads of a given service vehicle should be identified. The drive load is the amount of power that is required for moving the vehicle, and the service load is the power consumption of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices.</b> To identify drive and service loads, all the parameters in power balance equation of the engine should be either measured or estimated. As two inputs with unknown variations in this equation, vehicle mass and torque of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> are required to be estimated. This study proposes a model-based algorithm that utilizes available signals in the CAN bus of the vehicle as well as a signal from a GPS receiver (road grade information) for simultaneous estimation of the vehicle mass and torque of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices.</b> The power management system of the RAPS should determine the split ratio of auxiliary power demand between the generator and battery in order to minimize fuel consumption. It should also guarantee that the battery has enough energy for powering <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> at all the engine-OFF stops. To meet these objectives, a two-level control system is proposed in this study. In the high-level control system, a fast dynamic programming (DP) technique which utilizes extracted features of the predicted drive and service loads obtains an SOC trajectory. In the low-level control system, a refined Adaptive Equivalent Fuel Consumption Minimization (A-ECMS) technique is employed to track the SOC trajectory obtained by the high-level control scheme. Many numerical simulations are carried out to test the functionality of the proposed identification algorithm and power management system. Moreover, the numerical simulations are validated by Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) simulations. The results show the idling is completely eliminated and a significant amount of fuel is saved by implementing the RAPS on a service vehicle. Therefore, the cost of energy can be noticeably reduced and consequently the cost of RAPS is recouped {{in a short period of}} time...|$|R

A model for the selection of a set of process plans with the minimum corresponding manufacturing cost and minimal number of tools and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> is formulated.
