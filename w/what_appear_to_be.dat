5|$|The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118–36) {{was built}} with {{imperial}} sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a ribbed dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church {{is also a}} cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and ribbed types over <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space.|$|E
5|$|The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a {{successful}} attempt {{by a friend}} of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files {{are found to be}} written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to give an exact date of the extinction of Cumbric. However, there are some pointers which may give a reasonably accurate estimate. In the mid-11th century, some landowners still bore <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Cumbric names. Examples of such landowners are Dunegal (Dyfnwal), lord of Strathnith or Nithsdale; Moryn (Morien), lord of Cardew and Cumdivock near Carlisle; and Eilifr (Eliffer), lord of Penrith.|$|E

25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{composed}} of three sepals and three petals that are seldom noticed by people, they are small and hidden under extravagant stamens. <b>What</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower 'petal' is the pistil which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.|$|E

25|$|In some Baroque music neither split-chord nor triple-stop is {{appropriate}} and violinists will arpeggiate all chords (and even <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regular double stops), playing all notes individually {{as if they}} had been written as a slurred figure. In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string, to provide a basic accompaniment. This is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music.|$|E
25|$|Rhaetian was {{spoken in}} central parts of present-day Switzerland, Tyrol in Austria, and the Alpine regions of northeastern Italy. It is {{documented}} by {{a limited number}} of short inscriptions (found through Northern Italy and Western Austria) in two variants of the Etruscan alphabet. Its linguistic categorization is not clearly established, and it presents a confusing mixture of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Etruscan, Indo-European, and uncertain other elements. Howard Hayes Scullard argues that Rhaetian was also a Celtic language.|$|E
25|$|Some clay {{models of}} houses survive {{to give us}} an idea of what smaller {{dwellings}} were like. One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof.

25|$|Hnæf and his unnamed nephew, said {{also to be}} Hildeburh's son, {{are placed}} on a funeral pyre.

Eventually a figure {{referred to as the}} son of Hunlaf places a sword on Hengest's lap to remind him of his loyalties. Other Danes also return, and probably together they wreak havoc on the Frisians and slay king Finn.

25|$|From the 18th century until 1866, {{the island}} had various names, {{changing}} {{with each new}} owner. In that year, it was bought by Mr. John Hendrick, a local farmer. It stayed in the family for three decades, and supposedly his son and daughter-in-law lived with their child in {{a house on the}} island some time during this period. Since then, despite continued changes in ownership, the name Hendrick Island has persisted.

25|$|Aylesbury {{has always}} been quintessentially a market town, with the Market Square at its heart. The Market Square is still used for four markets a week and other events on special occasions. The siting of the medieval market stalls both semi-permanent and {{temporary}} has given the Market Square an unusual architectural character. As the temporary medieval market stalls, or allocated lots of the traders, on Market Square became less transient so the stalls began to become permanent buildings. Many of the square's oldest buildings such as the King's Head Inn are hidden in <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back alleys {{on the periphery of}} the square.|$|E
25|$|Beneath the lunettes are {{the four}} panels {{of the upper}} {{register}}. The two outer panels of the middle register show the Annunciation to Mary, with the Archangel Gabriel {{on the left and}} the Virgin Mary on the right. Both are dressed in white robes, and occupy <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the opposite ends of the same room. Gabriel and Mary's panels are separated by two much narrower images showing unoccupied domestic interior scenes. The back wall in the left-hand image has a window opening onto a view of street and city square, while that in the right-hand image has a niche. Some art historians have attempted to associate the street with an actual location in Ghent, but it is generally accepted that it is not modeled on any specific place. The sparseness of these narrow panels seem anomalous in the overall context of the altarpiece; a number of art historians have suggested that they were compromises worked out by Jan as he struggled to accommodate his design within the original framework set out by Hubert.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1875 {{up to the}} present, {{archaeologists have}} found more than a {{thousand}} Neolithic era clay artefacts that have examples of symbols similar to the Vinča script scattered widely throughout south-eastern Europe. This includes the discoveries of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> barter tokens, which were used as an early form of currency. Thus it appears that the Vinča or Vinča-Turdaş script is not restricted to just the region around Belgrade, which is where the Vinča culture existed, but that it was spread across most of southeastern Europe, and was used throughout the geographical region of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture. As a result of this widespread use of this set of symbolic representations, historian Marco Merlini has suggested that it be given a name other than the Vinča script, since this implies that it was only used among the Vinča culture around the Pannonian Plain, at the very western edge of the extensive area where examples of this symbolic system have been discovered. Merlini has proposed naming this system the Danube Script, which some scholars have begun to accept. However, even this name change would not be extensive enough, since it does not cover the region in Ukraine, as well as the Balkans, where examples of these symbols are also found. Whatever name is used, however (Vinča script, Vinča-Tordos script, Vinča symbols, Danube script, or Old European script), it is likely that it is the same system.|$|E
