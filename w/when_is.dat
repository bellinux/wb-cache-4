The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E

25|$|If Not Now, <b>When</b> ? <b>is</b> {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme that speaks on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he poses the question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that privilege is the ticket to happiness.|$|E

25|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases was proposed in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on {{a band saw}} machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. Band saw machines are not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users <b>when</b> <b>is</b> the best time to replace band saw.

500|$|Pre-production {{began at}} Cinecittà Studios around October 1957. The MGM Art Department {{produced}} more than 15,000 sketches and drawings of costumes, sets, props, and other items needed for the film (8,000 alone for the costumes); photostatted each item; and cross-referenced and catalogued them {{for use by the}} production design team and fabricators. More than a million props were ultimately manufactured. Construction of miniatures for the entrance of Quintus Arrius into Rome and for the sea battle were under way by the end of November 1957. MGM location scouts arrived in Rome to identify shooting locations in August 1957. Location shooting in Africa was actively under consideration, and in mid-January 1958, MGM said that filming in North Africa (later revealed to be Libya) would begin on March 1, 1958, and that 200 camels and 2,500 horses had already been procured for the studio's use there. The production was then scheduled to move to Rome on April 1, where Andrew Marton had been hired as second unit director and 72 horses were being trained for the chariot race sequence. However, the Libyan government canceled the production's film permit for religious reasons on March 11, 1958, just a week before filming was to have begun. It is unclear whether any second unit filming took place in Israel. A June 8, 1958, reported in The New York Times said second unit director Andrew Martin had roamed [...] "up and down the countryside" [...] filming footage. However, the American Film Institute claims the filming permit was revoked in Israel for religious reasons as well (although <b>when</b> <b>is</b> not clear), and no footage from the planned location shooting near Jerusalem appeared in the film.|$|E
