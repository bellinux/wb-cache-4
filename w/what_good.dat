25|$|While {{teachers}} {{point out}} the vital importance of good posture both {{for the sake of}} the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of repetitive strain injury, advice as to <b>what</b> <b>good</b> posture is and how to achieve it differs in details. However all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity. Things which are almost universally recommended is keeping the left wrist straight (or very nearly so) to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner. This, like any other unwarranted tension, would limit freedom of motion, and increase the risk of injury.|$|E

Biographer Michael Witwer believes the birth of Alex forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, up until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming.

According to Paul Tingen, from Sound on Sound magazine, The Nightfly was [...] "for years a popular demonstration record in hi-fi stores across the globe." [...] Paul White, editor-in-chief of Sound on Sound, said The Nightfly [...] "is {{always a good}} reference for checking out monitoring systems and shows <b>what</b> <b>good</b> results could be obtained from those early digital recording systems in the right hands." [...] In addition to its use in recording studio tests, Clive Young of Pro Sound News called Fagen's [...] "I.G.Y." [...] the [...] "Free Bird" [...] of pro audio, claiming that almost every live sound engineer uses the song to test the front-of-house system's sound response. EQ Magazine rated The Nightfly as among the Top 10 Best Recorded Albums of All Time, alongside the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.|$|E

It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s {{has been among the}} very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of <b>what</b> <b>good</b> TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." ...|$|E

[...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E

[...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard lauded the song's hook and remarked, [...] "As always, Gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for the masses." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating that [...] "Lady Gaga makes no secret that she's after mass adoration, and as far as lead singles go, her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start."

500|$|When Congress {{met again}} in December, {{although}} the Judiciary Committee voted 5–4 for impeachment, the House voted against it. On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton. [...] Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place. Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his place—though Stanton barricaded {{himself in his}} office.

[...] Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health {{he was unable to}} complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud. [...] He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people. [...] He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but [...] "this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves."

He also praised Gervais's performance calling his two monologues [...] "classic". The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser praised the multiple references layered in the episode commenting that they saved the episode from being [...] "mediocre". Despite this, he criticized the plot commenting {{that it did not}} come [...] "from the heart of the show". He ultimately gave the episode a B-, being beaten only by Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Hamburger Dinner Theater". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly mostly praised the short films competing against [...] "Angry Dad" [...] calling them [...] "the truly amusing stuff" [...] and adding that Condiments was a [...] "very accomplished replication of Pixar". However, he was critical of the guest stars, noting that, [...] "None of them were very funny, but that was the joke — they were parodying the toadying tone of awards patter. Well, Brand and Berry were; Gervais seemed to have improvised a lot of Gervais-y stream-of-jokiness blather that he may well have intended to be funny". Aly Semigran of MTV praised the episode for its animation parodies, writing, [...] "Sure, Toy Story and Wallace and Gromit might enjoy more Oscar love than their animated brethren, but The Simpsons send-ups were nothing if not a brilliant tip-of-the-hat to all of those films".|$|E

500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology.
