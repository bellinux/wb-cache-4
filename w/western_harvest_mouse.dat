40|$|Abstract. Hantavirus {{activity}} in 39 National Parks {{in the eastern}} and central United States was surveyed by testing 1, 815 small mammals of 38 species for antibody reactive to Sin Nombre virus. Antibody-positive rodents were found throughout the area sampled, and in most biotic communities. Antibody was detected in 7 % of 647 deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), 2 % of 590 white-footed mice (P. leucopus), 17 % of 12 rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), 3 % of 31 cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), and 33 % of 18 <b>western</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> (Reithrodontomys megalotis). Anti-body was also found in three of six species of voles, {{and in one of}} 33 chipmunks (Tamias minimus). Prevalence among Peromyscus was highest in the northeast. Although few cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been identified from the eastern and central regions, widespread infection in reservoir populations indicates that potential exists for human infection throughout much of the United States. Hantaviruses are lipid-enveloped, trisegmented, RNA vi-ruses of the family Bunyaviridae. Several New-World han-taviruses have been implicated as etiologic agents of han-tavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a serious human disease with a mortality of approximately 50 %. 1 The hantaviruses are rodent-borne zoonotic agents responsible for a wid...|$|R

The two most common species, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and <b>western</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> (Reithrodontomys megalotis), generally had population peaks {{in winter and}} nadirs in summer; several other murid species demonstrated autumn peaks and spring nadirs; heteromyids were infrequently captured in winter, and populations generally peaked in summer or autumn. Interannual trends indicated an interactive effect between temperature and precipitation.

Severity of adverse effects varied by species. Heteromyids, for example, were apparently not negatively affected by the hot, dry {{spring and summer of}} 2000.

To assess small mammal activity, trapping grids were placed at three sites from June 2011 to May 2012, and mark-recapture methods were used to estimate populations. Baited camera traps were placed in those sites and at two additional sites, and digital images were used to assess medium to large mammal occurrence.

They also experienced a significant decline during the colder months (Oct-Jan), which could be explained by the high metabolic cost of maintaining their core body temperatures. The camera traps were largely unproductive and captured a total of two target species (coyotes [Canis latrans] and red foxes [Vulpes vulpes]) in 1, 665 h of trapping.

Paired random sites were also sampled 50 meters from roost sites to determine roosting preferences. Shrub canopy cover was found to be significantly higher at owl roosts compared to random.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1992 This {{thesis is}} written in 2 {{sections}} to divide the major themes of the study. The second section is partially {{based on the work}} presented in the first. I studied the relationships between populations of both California voles (Microtus californicus) and <b>Western</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and vegetation structure and composition in northwestern California. Both species exhibited annual fluctuations in abundance during the 19 months of the study. In general, M. californicus populations were largest in areas with lower cover height and larger percent brown grass cover. This finding is contrary to the majority of Microtus spp. studies that have examined population - vegetation relationships. The discrepancy is likely {{due to the fact that}} all areas that I trapped had fairly abundant cover (no areas were grazed). The increase of M. californicus populations (from the annual low) coincided with grass seeds being more available (i. e., dropping off of grasses). To my knowledge I recorded the largest annually fluctuating M. californicus population ever found (range = 0 - 1414 ind/ha, Jolly-Seber estimate). I propose that resource limitation is a primary factor in M. californicus population fluctuations. R. megalotis populations fluctuated synchronously with those of M. californicus, but at much reduced numbers. Increasing populations of R. megalotis were associated with an increased availability of grass seeds. The largest populations of R. megalotis were associated with relatively low cover height of vegetation. Each month I developed discriminant function analysis models to predict both species of small mammal abundances using vegetation (structure and composition) variables.
