25|$|At age 14, Coulter {{visited her}} older brother in New York City where he {{attended}} law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by Milton Friedman and William E. Simon. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, {{he and his friends}} took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer. She graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002 while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet Washington Post columnist Lloyd Grove cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later allegedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.|$|E
25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} of a morally questionable plan being formulated among the senior officers that winter. On Jan 1, 1872, Tyson wrote in his diary: [...] "Last month such an astonishing proposition was made to me that I have never ceased thinking of it since... It {{grew out of a}} discussion as to the feasibility of attempting to get farther north next summer." [...] And then on April 19, 1872: [...] "Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made to me in the winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> to expose the matter." [...] Author Farley Mowat has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a very high latitude.|$|E
500|$|According to Geisel, he {{was walking}} down Madison Avenue in New York City after {{learning}} of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old Dartmouth College classmate. McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's president James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, [...] "If I had been walking {{down the other side}} of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today." [...] In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.|$|E

500|$|The Privy Garden was {{originally}} {{created as a}} private royal pleasure garden and continued to serve a similar purpose during the Interregnum (1649–1660), when the English Council of State put considerable effort and money into repairing and improving the garden. They appear to have reserved it exclusively for their own use, with their own individual keys for access. By Samuel Pepys' time, after the Restoration of the monarchy, it had become [...] "a through-passage, and common." [...] The wall that enclosed the garden was often used by ballad-sellers to display their wares to passers-by, and courtiers used it to air their laundry. Pepys recorded his titillation {{at the sight of}} the underwear of Charles II's mistress, Lady Castlemaine, hanging out to dry in the Privy Garden. A century later, James Boswell wrote in his diary that he had taken a prostitute into the garden and [...] "indulged sensuality", but he was shocked to find <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> that she had stolen his handkerchief.|$|E

As a youth, Francesco became a devotee of troubadours and was fascinated with all things Transalpine. [...] He was handsome, witty, gallant, and delighted in fine clothes. He spent money lavishly. Although many hagiographers remark about his bright clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures, his {{displays}} of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as {{is shown in the}} [...] "story of the beggar". In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for alms. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets. His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> his father scolded him in rage.|$|E

[...] "When I found out he was so close to Vermont I told him to come over." [...] Sweetapple also called their mutual friend J.

Then he reviled me, and told me, that he would send such a one after me, that should make my way bitter to my soul. So I turned to go away from him; but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me after himself.

50|$|Finally it is {{revealed}} that the handsome golden-haired surgeon Doctor Goodie was a NASA medical consultant on a secret manned mission to Venus to respond to mysterious laser signals promising a cure for cancer and all other earthly ills. Trapped by a strange magnetic force, however, the space probe Alpha Zero crashed on the planet. The doctor was the only survivor and was rescued by vaguely seen hairless, purple-clad extraterrestrials who repaired his broken body and transformed him into a cyborg whose mechanical plastic parts are integrated into his remaining organic organs via a complex network of computer circuitry, but {{because they had no}} idea what humans looked like, they gave him a new face similar to their own hideously gaunt and shriveled, chinless, snaggle-toothed and bulgy-eyed Phantom of the Opera-like alien features which proved terrifying to most ordinary earthlings <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home.</b> Later Doctor Goodie reveals that he has created elaborate prosthetic makeup which allows him to pass as a normal human doctor at the Ronkite Medical Complex when not leading the team as the two-fisted Doc Scary.

60|$|He {{raised the}} gun, and Appleby’s calmness deserted him. With {{a sweep of}} the riding crop he struck the barrel aside, and, perhaps without Davidson {{intending}} it, there was a flash and an explosion. Then the riding crop came down upon a dim white face. The man reeled, recovered, and lurched forward, while next moment he and his adversary were panting and straining in a breathless grapple. Davidson was a strong man, but the blow had dazed him, and the refreshment consumed at the “Black Bull” had endued him with an unreasoning passion, which was not an advantage in a conflict {{with a man who}} kept his head. Appleby was also wiry, and tolerably proficient in a certain useful art. Thus <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his fist <b>home</b> in a place where it would hurt Davidson slackened his grasp, and Appleby struck again as he flung him off. He staggered backwards and went down heavily. Appleby stood still until he rose shakily to his feet again.|$|R
5000|$|Two hundred Malagasy villagers had {{collected}} on the beach, all willing to lend a hand, and the captain got them to form a chain reaching form the vessel to the shore, some in boats and canoes, others standing in the water. The Malagasy soon landed the cargo, but [...] "amid a scene of great confusion," [...] with [...] "many a box of costly silks, satins, crapes, and handkerchiefs ornamenting different parts of their persons, while under their arms were boxes of tea, bundles of sewing silk, and other valuables the like of which the natives had never before seen." [...] Morrell ship's captain [...] "paced the beach to and fro like a maniac, with a brace of pistols in his hands, threatening to blow out the brains of the first man who broke open a box. But he was not ubiquitous, and the moment he turned his back, open went a box, and away ran the ... contents."The captain could only despair, his vision shattered and his kingdom sunk. His frown and cold command were now directed at those who, antlike, emptied his colossal wreck, now destined for the sandy depths. He could not police the chaos, and he lost {{a fair amount of}} cargo to the [...] "helpers." [...] A hundred bottles of medicinal cajuput oil that he had purchased in Singapore were [...] "lost," [...] while the sago he had also acquired was ruined by seawater. Once the cargo was unloaded, and the crew were ashore, Morrell put the chests and crates under armed guard and secured them with tents made from the ship's sails.In all, Morrell claimed officially to have saved 115 of the 400 full tea chests, 230 of the 450 half tea chests, and 380 of the 630 tea boxes--that is about 40 percent of the tea cargo. He also recuperated 360 cases or boxes of silks, which was by his estimation about half the total. Three cases of chinaware, a case of ink, and eight cases of pearl shirt buttons were also among the items recovered.It was the boxes of curiosities gathered from around the Bismarck Sea, however which were to cause the most trouble. Some of these chests had drifted ashore {{at the foot of the}} bay, and when an inquisitive Malagasy opened one, he was more than shocked to find it stuffed with dried skulls Captain Morell had stolen from villages on the islands of Arawe (New Britain) earlier in his voyage, as he felt they would sell well in New York and Philadelphia <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> to the US. As Jacob writes, the Malagasy were horrified and [...] "held a convention over them, and concluded that the crew of the Margaret Oakley were a set of piratical cannibals, who had been cruising along the shores of Madagascar, eating the people and preserving their skulls. This came near causing a bloody outbreak of savage fury upon our party, and it was only by consummate tact on the part of the captain that the enmity of the natives was allayed."
