5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> {{to come by}} as the season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E

5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some items <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to locate, {{while others}} were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E

5|$|Georgine Milmine {{was born}} in Ontario, Canada. Before joining McClure's as a researcher, she worked for the Syracuse Herald in New York.

5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} {{industrial}} research chemist, {{working in the}} lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E
5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> pressed by the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October {{the weather}} was more {{uncooperative}} than on the previous day.

Results of the day's strike operations <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days of strikes helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined with radio intercepts and the dusk strikes fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{following}} results. • Learning theory, {{and in particular}} PAC learning, was introduced by Valiant [CACM 1984] and has since become a major area of research in theoretical and applied computer science. One natural question that was posed at the very inception of the field is whether there are classes of functions that <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to learn. PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> under widely held conjectures such as the existence of one-way functions, {{and on the other}} hand it is known that if PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> then P ̸ = NP. We further study sufficient and necessary conditions for PAC learning to <b>be</b> <b>hard,</b> and we prove that: 1. ZK ̸ = BPP implies that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard.</b> 2. It <b>is</b> unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> implies that ZK ̸ = BPP. 3. It is unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that P ̸ = NP implies that ZK ̸ = BPP...|$|R
5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.|$|E

The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman.

5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> to find.|$|E
