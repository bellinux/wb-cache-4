The entire Santer Commission {{was forced to}} resign in 1999 by the Parliament as result of a fraud and corruption scandal, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role played by Édith Cresson. These frauds were revealed by an internal auditor Paul van Buitenen.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E

5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also {{tore down}} the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a cruciform basilica <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of}} the cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E

5|$|In {{the interim}} period, work went into {{expanding}} the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. In early 1998, the MTO {{announced plans for}} two contracts to widen Highway404 south of Highway7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane in each direction <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> barrier between them. High-mast lighting was also installed, replacing the unique luminaires used on the freeway. The second contract resulted in an additional lane in each direction on the outside the existing freeway south of Steeles Avenue, making it ten lanes wide. The proposal to eventually convert the inner lanes into HOV lanes was announced at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E

5|$|On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2miles (3km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short {{branch to}} Irvine Harbour {{opened on the}} same day. The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch from that point, opened on 9 August. This {{included}} the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> span of 181feet (55.2m) and 175feet (53.3m) high above the River Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span {{in the world at}} the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Once {{over the}} South China Sea, a strong ridge built over {{southern}} China resulting in Hester turning northwestward and accelerating. It reached a forward speed of 33km/h (20mph), twice the climatological average for typhoons {{in that region}} during October. Between October22 and 23, the storm developed an eye before reaching its peak intensity as a Category2-equivalent typhoon. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds to have reached 165km/h (105mph) along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> pressure of 967mb (hPa; 28.56inHg). Hester subsequently made landfall near Huế, South Vietnam. Once onshore, the storm's structure rapidly degraded as it weakened. The storm later dissipated over central Laos on October24.|$|E

Facing north and south, the two parallel wings are of unequal height, and are linked by a wider transverse area three floors in height, and further {{up by the}} lift shaft and the access to each floor. Between the two wings is a landscaped courtyard.|$|E

5|$|The Main Cell Block is {{the longest}} and tallest cell range in Australia, and a {{dominating}} feature of the prison. New Division, constructed between 1904 and 1907, continues the façade alignment of the main block. Service buildings were converted into the separate Women's Prison. Fremantle Prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, while a two storey limestone gatehouse, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> clock, presents an imposing entrance. North {{and south of the}} gatehouse, on The Terrace, are several cottages and houses – three of which are built in Victorian style in contrast to the Georgian style of the others.|$|E
