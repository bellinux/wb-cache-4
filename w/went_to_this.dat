25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same way they did the Sultan's, then take a seat in front of her. She would give them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E

500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant.

Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E

[...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> whole level of artistry. But he {{made me feel like}} I had nothing to offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list and we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> little cafe. Little did I know we'd be playing that set {{for the next ten}} years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E

500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E
2500|$|On 17 April, Djevdet {{ordered his}} battalions to annihilate Shatakh. The ill-disciplined force instead {{attacked}} Armenian villages located nearer to Van. On the same day, Arshak Vramian was arrested. A schoolmaster was also arrested in Shadakh in mid-April. There {{had been a}} local demonstration in his favor. Several prominent Armenians, led by Nikoghayos Poghos Mikaelian (Ishkhan), <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> town {{at the request of}} Djevdet. Nikoghayos Poghos Mikaelian and other prominent Armenians were stopped midway at Hirj and murdered on 17 April. Among the three leaders of the ARF only Aram Manugian escaped. Djevdet also took action against the leaders of the ARF in Van. For the resistance, this was a sign that the city was not safe. Djevdet was believed to have thought that, by killing leaders of the Armenian parties, he would destroy the cohesion of the resistance. The minister of interior Mehmed Talat Bey with his [...] (known by the Armenians as the Red Sunday) requested the arrest of the leaders of Armenian community in the Ottoman capital and other centers. They were held in two holding centers near Ankara. Arshak Vramian was sent to the capital with a guard, and was reported to have been killed along the way.|$|E
2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

They had 'Young Money' sprayed on the gates, 'Drake and Wayne,' 'cause I came to shoot the video out there. I'm talking about you drive by people's homes, they had 'Drake,' 'Young Money,' 'Drake, Welcome Here,' 'Drake We Love You' — crazy sh--, man. It was so crazy. This dude was like, 'Original Weezy tha God! You tha boss! Weezy tha God!' It's crazy. They love us, 'cause we show love out there." [...] The video was released on May 11, 2010, on Drake's blog and on MTV. In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's kind of like the anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene. It's about really understanding what's right and what's wrong and it's really easy to lose that when you're the center of attention. He did it fearlessly, he did it without any sign of hesitation. He wanted to do something that went further with the song, that took the essence of the song but communicated it with imagery that made people think, rather than go up the middle and make an obvious R video." ...|$|E
