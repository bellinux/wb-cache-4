[...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E

In the meantime, the singer also worked with French disc jockey Madeon. This was his first experience collaborating with a vocalist face-to-face. On MTV News he clarified that he had [...] "always wanted to work with pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Having mutual respect for each other's work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. He reminds me of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." ...|$|E

In August 2013, while being interviewed by French radio station, Fun Radio, Gaga confirmed that she had recorded [...] "Gypsy" [...] with Madeon and RedOne, as well as White Shadow.

[...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it. The song showcases Gaga's fans as being the people with whom she feels at home.|$|E

500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E

[...] However, Powell believed that the case was one of little importance and in 1990 stated that he hadn't devoted thirty minutes to thinking about it since the ruling.|$|E

I was the host. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> row with ITV I was banned from the studios.

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
