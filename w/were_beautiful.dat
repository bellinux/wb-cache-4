5|$|After {{finishing}} an apprenticeship, Evans {{went into}} business for himself. By the early 1850s, he {{had established a}} reputation as a printer of covers for a type of cheap novels known as yellow-backs. In the early 1860s, he began to print children's toy books and picture books in association with the printing house Routledge and Warne. His intention was to produce books for children that <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> and inexpensive. For three decades he produced multiple volumes each year, first illustrated by Crane, and later by Caldecott and Greenaway.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He {{believed that the}} work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E

Among these games <b>were</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Katamari and Space Invaders Extreme, which were demonstrated at Tokyo Game Show in September 2009. According to creative director Kudo Tsunoda, adding Kinect-based control to pre-existing games would involve significant code alterations, making it unlikely for Kinect features {{to be added}} through software updates.|$|E

25|$|Most {{city dwellers}} {{appear to have}} been traders or artisans, who lived with others {{pursuing}} the same occupation in well-defined neighbourhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals, beads and other objects. Among the artefacts discovered <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> glazed faïence beads. Steatite seals have images of animals, people (perhaps gods), and other types of inscriptions, including the yet un-deciphered writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well.|$|E

25|$|On {{account of}} the {{evolution}} of society today; text messaging, e-mails, social media, and other technological advancements, have dominated an individual’s sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a “platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies”. According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they <b>were</b> <b>beautiful,</b> while approximately 70% of women and girls believed the media’s portrayal of impractical beauty standards fuelled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were most unhappy with their bodies, while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.|$|E

500|$|In Scandinavia too, in {{the nineteenth}} century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called [...] "elves" [...] (älvor in modern Swedish, alfer in Danish, álfar in Icelandic), {{although}} the more formal translation in Danish is feer. Thus, the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has [...] "wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet". Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death.

500|$|As {{they are}} the movie's [...] "central {{dramatic}} piece", the encoffining ceremonies in Departures have received extensive commentary.

James Adams of The Globe and Mail wrote {{that they were a}} [...] "dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with sleights of hand bordering on the magicianly". As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance. Viewers see that the ceremonies are not simply about preparing the body, but also about [...] "bring dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.|$|E

Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone stated that Wipeout Pulse was a [...] "very visually pleasing game with some solid visual effects", and also praised the detailed tracks and ships. A reviewer from Game Revolution considered the game's level of detail to the tracks and smooth framerate to be [...] "staggering" [...] on a handheld. The reviewer also praised the [...] "meticulously constructed" [...] backdrops and [...] "incredibly styled" [...] presentation. Guy Cocker of GameSpot said that the visuals were [...] "superb", though he thought that many aspects were similar to its predecessor, Wipeout Pure.

500|$|Sword of Mana {{sold over}} 277,000 copies in Japan in 2003. It {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The game's presentation was praised, especially its graphics; Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot praised the [...] "lush, colorful backgrounds" [...] and animation quality, which was seconded by the reviewer for GamePro. Game Informers Justin Leeper {{also felt that}} the graphics <b>were</b> <b>beautiful,</b> and Shane Bettenhausen of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it was [...] "one of the most stunning games on [...] GBA". Kevin Gifford of 1UP.com also praised the graphics {{in relation to other}} Game Boy Advance games, while Darryl Vassar of GameSpy said {{that it would have been}} the best-looking Game Boy Advance game if were not for what he felt was poor animation quality. Reaction to the music was more mixed; while the reviews for Game Informer and GamePro praised it, Shoemaker of GameSpot termed the music [...] "mostly bland" [...] and Craig Harris of IGN and GameSpy's Vassar said it was nice but repetitive. Reviewers also noted technical problems with the presentation: both the GameSpot and IGN reviews noted graphical glitches in the game as marring the presentation.|$|E
500|$|These {{soundings}} {{were taken}} personally by FitzRoy, and the tallow from each sounding {{was cut off}} and taken on board to be examined by Darwin. The impressions taken on the steep outside slope of the reef were marked with the shapes of living corals, and otherwise were clean down to about 10fathoms (18m); then at increasing depths, the tallow showed fewer such impressions and collected more grains of sand until {{it was evident that}} there were no living corals below about 20–30fathoms (36–55m). Darwin carefully noted the location of the different types of coral around the reef and in the lagoon. In his diary, he described, [...] "examining the very interesting yet simple structure & origin of these islands. The water being unusually smooth, I waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks. In some of the gullies & hollows, there <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> green & other colored fishes, & the forms & tints of many of the Zoophites were admirable. It is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics, so prodigal of life, teems", though he cautioned against the [...] "rather exuberant language" [...] used by some naturalists.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. GameSpot writer Jeff Sengstack said the {{expensive}} budget and long production history [...] "do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered [...] " [...] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame". Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like Cleopatra and Waterworld. He said the graphics <b>were</b> <b>beautiful,</b> {{but the game}} ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were [...] "ordinary, pixilated fare" [...] was [...] "odd and unflattering". A one-star review in The Video Games Guide, published in 2013, [...] "now seems {{little more than a}} flawed, though ambitious, white elephant". In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content {{for the end of the}} game. But he said it was ultimately [...] "less a bad game than a bad horror film" [...] and said the execution, [...] "although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices".|$|E

2500|$|According to Aristotle, {{although}} most [...] "belligerent nations" [...] were {{strongly influenced by}} their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (Politics II 1269b). H. D. Rankin in Celts and the Classical World notes that [...] "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does Ammianus (30.9). It {{seems to be the}} general opinion of antiquity." [...] In book XIII of his Deipnosophists, the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian Athenaeus, repeating assertions made by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC (Bibliotheca historica 5:32), wrote that Celtic women <b>were</b> <b>beautiful</b> but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that [...] "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be Poseidonius and speculates that these authors may be recording male [...] "bonding rituals".|$|E
