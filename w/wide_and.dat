5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> a few metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can {{on rare occasions}} grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E

5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey. However, the Widnes promontory is not particularly <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> another possible explanation is the first part derives from the Danish ved, meaning a wood and possibly referring to a tree-covered promontory. Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Bald eagle nests {{are often}} very large {{in order to}} {{compensate}} for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 20 feet deep.|$|E

5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, {{a segment of the}} ditch 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.|$|E
5|$|For unarmored {{targets and}} shore bombardment, the 1,900lb (862kg) Mk.13 HC (High-Capacity—referring {{to the large}} {{bursting}} charge) shell was available. The Mk.13 shell would create a crater 50feet (15m) <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 20feet (6m) deep upon impact and detonation, and could defoliate trees 400yards (360m) {{from the point of}} impact. Mk. 13 High Capacity shells that were made by manufacturers other than the Naval Gun Factory received the designation Mk. 14 HC, but were otherwise identical.|$|E

5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E

5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure.

5|$|Smith's {{replacement}} was Ron Suart, {{who wanted}} Matthews {{to stay out}} <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> did not value his contribution {{in the way that}} Smith had done. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to take his place, and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E

Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
