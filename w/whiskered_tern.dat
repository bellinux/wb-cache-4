40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (RhÃ´ne delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the Â« Fondation Tour du Valat Â», the Â« Centre d'Ã‰cologie de Camargue Â» (C. N. R. S.), the Â« RÃ©serve Nationale de Camargue Â» (S. N. P. N.) and the Â« Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence Â» (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering Little Bustards have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 Long-tailed Skuas together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the Slender-billed Gull was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. <b>Whiskered</b> <b>Terns</b> bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of Red-rumped Swallows whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a Red-throated Pipit was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|R
40|$|This ornithological report {{covering}} the years 1982 and 1983 follows on {{from a series}} begun in 1950. lt deals mainly {{with the results of}} the long-term monitoring of several bird communities in the Camargue and lists a few species which are accidentai in the area. The baseline for inclusion of unusual observations is provided by the Guide des Oiseaux de Camargue (Blondel et Isenmann, 1981) which gives the status and phenology of the 337 species recorded in the Camargue, the Crau and the Alpilles. Now that a rare birds committee has been established in France only those observations accepted by this committee will in future be published here. The present report, however, was written before the committee had given a verdict on sorne of the observations submitted. The meteorological report shows that 1982 was a dry year with a mild winter and a hot summer. The autumn was mild and characterised by a freak storm from the S. E. on the 7 - 8 November 1983 was also a dry year; the spring was dominated by frequent and strong S. E. winds and the summer was hot. Cormorants have been censused for the 3 rd and 4 th consecutive winters and their numbers have peaked at between 4 000 and 6 000 (Fig. 1). The recent increase in numbers can perhaps be related to the increase of the breeding populations of Denmark and Rolland, since ringed birds from Rolland have been sighted in the Camargue. Reed-nesting herons are censuse d annually by aerial photography over the major part of the south coast of Franoe. The Grey heron continues to increase in number and to extend its range (Table l). Purple heron numbers have increased since 1981, but unlike the Grey, the major colonies of this species are not situated within the Camargue proper but to the East and West of the two main arms of the river. Tree-nesting herons have also been censused annually since 1968. Their numbers are given in Table II, from which {{it can be seen that}} the Cattle egret population has practically stopped increasing and now fluctuates at around 400 pairs. Both Little and Cattle egrets have also been censused at the winter roosts (Table III). Breeding Bitterns we re also censused and 5 4 Â« boom ing) males were located in the greater Camargue area in 1983; the number found in the Camargue proper (24) being the same as in 1982. Both years produced record numbers of flamingos breeding in the delta : 10500 pairs raised 6825 chicks in 1982 and 14400 pairs raised 7200 chicks in 1983, the latter being the only colony established throughout the western Mediterranean. The ringing programme started in 1977 was continued and 652 and 720 chicks respectively were marked the two years. These birds are individually recogniseable in the field and there have now been over 19000 contacts from a total of 4688 colour-ringed flamingos (56 % of the sample). Sightings are from the Western Mediterranean in particular, but with a few birds in Senegal, Mauritania and Libya. Following the strong S. E. winds of early November 1982, small groups of flamingos were sighted well inland in France. One ringed bird is known to have returned to the Camargue after being seen on the River IsÃ¨re (DrÃ´me), 185 km up the RhÃ´ne valley. In spite of the large numbers of flamingos in the Camargue these two springs the problem of these birds feeding in the rice-paddies has not worsened. On the contrary, the scaring campaings have paid off and no subsequent damage was reported by the farmers (even though the area under rice cultivation has increased). The wintering Bewick's Swan population peaked at 55 - 60 in 1981 - 82 and 68 in 1982 - 83, rather lower than the peaks of 85 and 82 individuals recorded in the past. Over the past six years the number of Shelducks recorded along the south coast of France prior to breeding has been around 1400 individuals. About 500 pairs breed in the area, mainly in the salines of the Camargue and Petite Camargue. The colour-ringing programme was continued and a further 69 birds were marked, bringing the total of individually recogniseable Shelducks ringed since 1978 to 316. Sightings of these birds on the Â« Grosser Knechtsand Â» have shown that birds from the south of France join the vast majority of birds from North Western Europe for the annual moult in the German Waddenzee (see Table IV). Following the cold spell in N. Europe in winter 1981 - 82, a record number of 2060 Shelducks were counted in S. France, most of these (1876) being in the Camargue and Petite Camargue. Results of the monthly winter censuses of other Anatidae species, carried out by the C. N. R. S. since 1964 - 65, are summarised in Table V and VI, prepared and commented upon by A. Tamisier. During the winter of 1982 - 83 total duck numbers peaked at only 100000. This is lower than usual and may be attributed to two factors mainly : the S. E. storm of early November and the gradual loss of good habitat (disturbance by hunting and fishing has increased). In order to emphasize the importance of disturbance-free areas the numbers of ducks recorded on the St Seren marsh located in the centre of the Tour du Valat Reserve are given in Table VII. Regarding the larger raptors there has been no change in the status of the Egyptian vulture and Eagle owl in the Alpilles, but the two pairs of Bonelli's eagles have had very poor breeding seasons with only 2 young raised in two years. In the Camargue there has been no detectable change in the Marsh harrier population, an estimated 84 occupied nest sites being located in 1982. In the Crau the winte ring population of Little bustards has remained relatively stable over the past ten years at around 1000 individuals (max. 1283 in Dec. 1982. Amongst the waders on passage unusually high numbers of Marsh sandpipers, up to 15 - 16 together, have been recorde deach autumn. a Terek sandpiper was shot locally in Sept. 1983 and there are two further May records of Wilson's phalarope, a species now observed almost annually. The 1982 census of breeding laro-limicolae revealed 26 pairs of Slenderbilled gulls but these failed to raise any chicks. In 1983, however, a similar number of pairs raised 60 young, by far the most successful season on record for this species. Mediterranean gulls also had two good seasons with a record 13 pairs in 1982 and 14 young raised in 1983 by 5 - 6 pairs (incomplete census). <b>Whiskered</b> <b>terns,</b> on the other hand, did not breed in 1982 and failed in their attempt in 1983 (200 + pairs). Amongst the passerines a Desert wheatear was recorded in the Crau in February 1983. This bird, the second recorded from the Crau in 3 years, has been accepted by the rareties committee. Finally, an event which has either been overlooked in the past or is a new development, is the importance of a Carrion crow roost near Le Sambuc where 950 were recorded in December 198...|$|R
