5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax <b>Wood</b> <b>Fibre</b> Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} pulp mill in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided to try the sulphite method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E

25|$|All plywoods bind resin and <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> sheets (cellulose {{cells are}} long, strong and thin) {{to form a}} {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply.|$|E
500|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|E

Weaving, pearl fishing, smithy and ship building were prominent industries of ancient Tamilakam.

Madurai and Urayur were important industrial centers, known for their cotton textiles. Muslin cloth was woven with fine floral work of different colors. Silk cloth was manufactured with its threads gathered in small knots at its ends. Clothing was [...] embroidered for the nobles and aristocrats who were the main customers.

In addition to silk and cotton fabrics, cloth made of <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> called Sirai Maravuri and Naarmadi [...] was used by the priestly class. The cloth manufacturers wove long pieces of cloth and delivered it to the dealers. The textile dealers then scissored off bits of required length, called aruvai or tuni, at the time of sale.

Gripping fibres is problematic, not to mention the measurement of meaningful load displacement data. Using a novel three point bend test technique, the Young’s moduli of single <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> were determined. Fibres were placed on a specially designed test rig and a scanning probe microscope was used to apply a load and to measure the deflection at the centre of each fibre. A model of the fibre was produced in order to facilitate data analysis. The technique proved to be feasible, resulting in an average Young’s modulus value of 24. 4 GPa for Pinus Sylvestris softwood fibres. This compares well with other values in the literature, but there is scope for improvement in the methodology to lead to more accurate measurements...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the conducted research work was to study the performance of compression and normal wood as a raw material for medium density fibreboards (MDF). For this purpose stems from Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) with a high content of compression wood were selected, separated in compression wood and normal wood and finally chipped. Thermomechanical pulps (TMP) were prepared form both types of chips. Morphological, physical and chemical invenstigations were carried out on both wood samples {{as well as on}} TMP prepared therefrom. Moreover, medium density fibreboards (MDF) were made at pilot scale using a melamine modified urea formaldehyde resin (MUF-resin) as a binder. The results can be summarized as follows: Native compression <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> showed lower average fibre length (15 %) compared to TMP from normal wood. Possibly due to the higher lignin content the water retention value (WRV-value) of TMP from compression wood was lower (10 %) in comparison to normal <b>wood</b> <b>fibres.</b> Cold water extracts of TMP from normal and compression wood showed the same pH-value, the buffering capacity of cold water extracts was more or less at the same level. Moreover, the formaldehyde release of TMP from compression <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> was lower in comparison to normal <b>wood</b> <b>fibres.</b> Concerning the physical-mechanical properties of MDF the following results were found: MDF, prepared from compression wood TMP, showed lower thickness swelling values (20 [...] . 30 %) compared to MDF from TMP of normal wood. Also the water absorption value from compression wood MDF was at a relatively lower level. Moreover, MDF prepared from compression wood TMP showed in comparison to MDF from normal wood TMP both a higher internal bond strength (> 35 %) als well as a higher surface hardness (Brinell-hardness) (25 %). The higher surface hardness {{may be due to the}} higher lignin content of compression <b>wood</b> <b>fibres.</b> In contrast, the bending strength of compression wood MDF was on a slightly lower level. This may be due to the shorter fibre length of compression wood TMP...|$|R
