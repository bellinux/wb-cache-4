5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E

5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had stated that they <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, {{and by the time}} Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Cuba and Puerto Rico, {{neither of}} which were {{expected}} to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly. Cuba's Civil Defense evacuated 350,000people from the coastal provinces. The government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm. Soldiers and emergency officials <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters, but stood down when it became evident {{that they would not}} needed. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed a five-member team to Puerto Rico ahead of Hurricane Dean. They were equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In its daily {{tropical}} weather outlook, the India Meteorological Department warned fishermen on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to not go {{into the}} ocean due to the anticipated rough seas. Upon approaching the coast of Bangladesh, officials canceled all flights {{to and from the}} Shah Amanat International Airport. Additionally, authorities at the port of Chittagong worked to protect cargo ships from the storm, and it was ultimately closed for a period of 19hours. In preparation for Akash, officials advised coastal residents to evacuate further inland; about 80,000 total residents left for emergency shelters. About 40,000 Red Cross volunteers <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> aid those potentially affected.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, {{the young}} Matilda's court {{included}} knights, chaplains and ladies-in-waiting, although, unlike some queens of the period, {{she did not}} have her own personal chancellor to run her household, instead using the imperial chancellor. When acting as regent in Italy, she found the local rulers <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept a female ruler. Her Italian administration included the Italian chancellor, backed by experienced administrators. She was not called upon to make any major decisions, instead dealing with smaller matters and acting as the symbolic representative of her absent husband, meeting with and helping to negotiate with magnates and clergy.|$|E

The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E
5|$|On August 17 a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Cuba between the provinces of Camagüey and Guantánamo. This was upgraded {{on the afternoon of}} August 18 to {{a tropical}} storm warning. At 0300 UTC August 19 {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for portions of central Cuba: Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Spíritus, Cienfuegos, Matanzas, and Isla de la Juventud. Had it been necessary, soldiers and emergency officials <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters. More than 350,000people were evacuated by the Civil Defense in the coastal provinces, and the government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Strategic {{deception}} included increasing {{military activity}} far away, near Moscow. At {{the sites of}} the planned attack, elaborate disinformation was fed to the enemy. Defence lines were built to deceive German tactical reconnaissance. Civilians within 25 kilometres of the front were evacuated, and trenches were dug around the villages for Luftwaffe reconnaissance to see. Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment and boats <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> suggest an offensive there.

5|$|The 1660 Restoration {{was popular}} in Scotland since it ended the Union and an {{expensive}} military occupation, although ironically it was welcomed in England {{for the same}} reasons. Scottish Parliamentary elections installed a Royalist majority which passed a series of acts giving greater power to the Crown, the most significant being the Rescissory Act of March 1661. This returned Scotland to the constitutional position of 1633, restoring the legal system and Parliament but imposing the Episcopalian structure on the Kirk rejected in 1638. Many <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept this since continuing divisions within the Presbyterian Kirk made it seem impossible they could create a unified church.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pilot}} was set in and around Boston, {{production}} was set in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, {{making it one of}} the most expensive pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced to hire a new cow for the remainder of the season because they were not allowed to travel the original cow from Canada to New York. Production team members noted that they <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries {{it was a}} financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E
