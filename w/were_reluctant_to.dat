5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic. Research showed that women <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> carry {{a pack of}} Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British {{were concerned about}} communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Polish forces led {{by general}} Stefan Czarniecki ravaged {{southern}} Swedish Pomerania, and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun. The Habsburg and Brandenburg allies however <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> join Czarniecki, and against John II Casimir's wish decided against taking {{the war to}} the Holy Roman Empire fearing {{the start of a}} new Thirty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} racing {{and asked the}} organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Barry Hoban won the stage, This was later a subject of argument as it was widely believed that the race winner should have been Denson, Simpson's other teammate and close friend.|$|E

5|$|One reason {{senators}} <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> {{remove the}} President {{was that his}} successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.|$|E

5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E
5|$|The planned Pecheneg {{attack from}} the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to {{transport}} them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard. On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E

50|$|Albert Mehrabian {{developed}} an early questionnaire measure of rejection sensitivity. Mehrabian suggested that sensitive individuals <b>are</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> express opinions, tend to avoid arguments or controversial discussions, <b>are</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make requests or impose on others, are easily hurt by negative feedback from others, {{and tend to}} rely too much on familiar others and situations {{so as to avoid}} rejection.|$|R
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> allocate {{any of their}} wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E

5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
