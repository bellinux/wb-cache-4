2500|$|In the 1950s, strong radio {{sources were}} found to be {{associated}} with very dim, very red objects. [...] When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken there were absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected. [...] It was soon realised that <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly red shifted. [...] These were named quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars, by [...] Hong-Yee Chiu in 1964. [...] Quasars are now thought to be galaxies formed {{in the early years of}} our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive black holes.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{remarkable}} {{occurred in}} our march through this country. When {{we had gone}} through the desert, after two days farther travel; we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, on the great river so called, which we were told, parted Europe from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little better, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the wonder will cease, when I inform my readers of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make them faithful subjects, than good Christians.|$|E
60|$|As I {{only twice}} experimented {{on more than}} a single species in a genus, I cannot say whether the crossed {{offspring}} of the several species within the same genus differ in their degree of superiority over their self-fertilised brethren; but I should expect that this would often prove to be the case from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> with the two species of Lobelia and with the individuals of the same species of Nicotiana. The species belonging to distinct genera in the same family certainly differ in this respect. The effects of cross- and self-fertilisation may be confined either to the growth or to the fertility of the offspring, but generally extends to both qualities. There does not seem to exist any close correspondence between the degree to which their offspring profit by this process; but we may easily err on this head, as there are two means for ensuring cross-fertilisation which are not externally perceptible, namely, self-sterility and the prepotent fertilising influence of pollen from another individual. Lastly, it has been shown in a former chapter that the effect produced by cross and self-fertilisation on the fertility of the parent-plants does not always correspond with that produced on the height, vigour, and fertility of their offspring. The same remark applies to crossed and self-fertilised seedlings when these are used as the parent-plants. This want of correspondence probably depends, at least in part, on the number of seeds produced being chiefly determined by the number of the pollen-tubes which reach the ovules, and this will be governed by the reaction between the pollen and the stigmatic secretion or tissues; whereas the growth and constitutional vigour of the offspring will be chiefly determined, not only by the number of pollen-tubes reaching the ovules, but {{by the nature of the}} reaction between the contents of the pollen-grains and ovules.|$|E
