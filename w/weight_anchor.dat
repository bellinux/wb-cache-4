40|$|This {{research}} project {{is set up}} together with Bluerise B. V. and the Technical University of Delft. The project is initiated as a pre-research for a future Ecopark, located next to the international airport of Curacao. The Ecopark is an innovative design thought of by Curacao Airport Holding (CAH). The Ecopark will consist of an ocean thermal energy conversion plant (OTEC) and a sea water air-conditioning plant (SWAC). Because of {{the high costs of}} air-conditioning and energy on the island, cheap green energy solutions are very welcome. To make sure that the OTEC and SWAC plant perform as expected, a detailed temperature profile over the whole water depth is essential. If the water is too cold at the top layers of the ocean and/or too warm at the seabed, the plant will not reach its full potential. The purpose of the {{research project}} is to deliver a design and installation method of an appropriate Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system. This measurement system provides near-real time and high resolution temperature data. The data is obtained by installing a fiber optic cable 7 km offshore at the north coast of Curacao at a depth of 1 km. A focus has been put on the technical, economic and political aspects of installing a DTS system in deep water and on land. With the help of a geographical-, cultural-, stakeholder- and system analysis important background data and information will be considered and processed. The optimal configuration is the configuration with a subsurface buoy, where the computer is located on shore. This configuration has some technical challenges, which are analysed. Several alternatives of the different components are developed. A preliminary design is chosen through a multi criteria analysis. There is chosen for a mooring line in which the fiber optic cable is integrated, this combination of two cables will be called the DTS cable. The DTS cable is suspended in a vertical line spanning over 950 m water, {{with the use of a}} submerged buoy and dead <b>weight</b> <b>anchor</b> combination. An Ultima-L DTS computer will send a signal from the shore through 7 km of the cable to the anchor location and then upward for 950 m to the submerged buoy. Along the whole length of the cable the signal will be reflected, which will be analysed by the DTS computer. The data will be saved in an online shared file, enabling the data to be read in the Netherlands. The wind- and wave loads can be considered as rough at the north side of the island. These two components and the current profile are of major importance for the design of the DTS system. The technical challenges of the project depend on the choice of equipment used in the design, the installation procedures and the type of shore landing of the DTS cable. The DTS cable has a limited tensile strength and in combination with the extreme water depth narrow margins have to be implemented to realize the design. This limitation determines the size of the anchor and of the buoy, which will have a profound impact on the quality of the data generated by the DTS system. For the installation procedures a research vessel named the Chapman, a smaller RIB and divers are necessary. The Chapman will install the buoy, the anchor and the DTS cable. With this procedure, the biggest risk in the project arises. The risk during the installation method described in this report is the entanglement of the different cables, which still needs further research. The success of the project depends on the cooperation with the stakeholders. The permit approval of Maritime Authority Curacao (MAC) and the approval of CAH to build on their ground are the most important aspects of the stakeholder analysis. Economic aspects of the design are closely linked to the technical solutions, to the technical challenges, and to the measurement accuracy required by the client Bluerise B. V [...] A comparison has been made between the accuracy of the DTS system measurements and the costs. These trade-off result in the definitive design that consists of a subsurface buoy, a dead <b>weight</b> <b>anchor</b> and a computer on land. The result is presented to the client Bluerise B. V.

By a simple system of floats, <b>weights,</b> and <b>anchors,</b> {{thousands}} of hooks, each on a separate leader, are suspended {{at a distance of}} from six inches to a foot above the bottom. The remarkable thing about such a line is the hook. It is barbless, and in place of the barb, the hook is filed long and tapering to a point as sharp as that of a needle. These hoods are only a few inches apart, and when several thousand of them are suspended just above the bottom, like a fringe, for a couple of hundred fathoms, they present a formidable obstacle to the fish that travel along the bottom.|$|R

Advantages to neck weights and more upper-body-centric weighted vests is that they allow easier spinal flexion (contracting abdominals or stretching extensor spinae) and extension (contracting extensor spinae, stretching abdominals). This makes them prime for adding resistance to these movements, and takes out the requirement of using the arms to <b>anchor</b> <b>weight</b> to the upper body to add resistance.|$|R
40|$|As Norwegian {{fisheries}} deploy {{demersal longlines}} at greater water depths in steep continental slope areas, ocean current displacement—the horizontal movements of longlines {{from the position}} at which the anchors are dropped to their positions on the seabed after sinking—may adversely affect this industry, primarily in two ways: o Economic : By loss of longlines, fishing opportunities and catching efficiency o Environmental : Marine pollution due {{to the loss of}} fishing gear The main factors resulting in ocean current displacement are: o Current Speed o Water Depth o Longline Sinking Speed : A complex factor influenced by the longline’s materials and composition which experimental research suggests is difficult to measure o Initial displacement of a longline The aim of the present work is to analyze the sinking speed of longlines on various parameters—thickness, materials, <b>anchor</b> <b>weights,</b> baits, shooting speed and shooting method—using numerical methods. Describing an underwater flexible structure like longline fishing gear in three dimensions requires the structure to be divided into finite elements. In the present work, the longline is modeled as mass points connected by springs. First, the modeling incorporates non-active points into a conventional mass-spring model to improve the efficiency of the calculation and the graphical representation. The modeling consists of the following: o Active mass points o Non-active points : These points are not involved in physical calculation but function to adjust the position of structures through a geometrical transformation. Implementing non-active points demonstrably enhances the efficiency of the calculation and graphical representation when compared to modeling only the active points. o Springs Experiments were conducted in a flume tank (still water) to measure the properties of different baits. This was done to ensure the correct resistance coefficients, depending on the shape, sinking orientations and sizes, which were implemented in the simulations. This research suggests that the bait’s resistance coefficient depends on the following: o The projected area of the bait, created by the method used to cut the bait o The method of attaching the bait to the hooks Full-scale longline sinking experiments were conducted to verify the results of the numerical methods, including varying the longline sinking speed with different <b>anchor</b> <b>weights</b> and without rigged snoods and hooks. These early experiments suggested that <b>anchor</b> <b>weight</b> does not have much influence on sinking speed for the middle part of longlines, though we suspected that the measured impact of the <b>anchor</b> <b>weight</b> might have been more pronounced had we conducted these experiments in deeper water. When we conducted full-scale longline sinking experiments with snoods, hooks and baits, we witnessed good agreement between the numerical method and experimental results. The behavior of different positions along the longlines was simulated with various parameters, such as bait properties, material properties (i. e., thickness and density), <b>anchor</b> <b>weights,</b> shooting speeds and shooting methods. To assist fishermen at sea (where the time required to analyze the results of the simulation would cause the loss of fishing opportunities), the results of these simulations were used to establish simplified equations for deriving the longline sinking speed as a function of depth and the parameters mentioned above. Finally, in order to calculate the current displacement, the current speed and direction were analyzed, considering the seasonal conditions, for the most common longlining area in Norway. This analysis resulted in the standardizing the displacement calculations for the longlines at current speeds and directions common for the Ormen Lange area. This study, therefore, has introduced another way to handle ocean current displacement phenomena in a manner directly helpful to Norway’s demersal longline fisheries.
