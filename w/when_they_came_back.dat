5|$|Although it was {{the second}} Champions League season to feature clubs that had not won their {{national}} leagues the year before, Manchester United and Bayern Munich were the first such clubs to reach the final of the competition. Nevertheless, both went into the match as champions, having won their domestic leagues in 1998–99; Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title with a 1–1 draw against Hertha BSC on 9 May with three games to go, while Manchester United left it until {{the last day of the}} season (16 May), <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from 1–0 down against Tottenham Hotspur to win 2–1 and beat Arsenal to the title by a point. Both teams were also playing for the Treble; in addition to their league win, Manchester United had beaten Newcastle United in the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May to claim the Double, while Bayern were due to play Werder Bremen in the 1999 DFB-Pokal Final on 12 June.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to the Bethel and Hai area, Abram's and Lot's sizable {{livestock}} herds {{occupied the}} same pastures. This became {{a problem for}} the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand (north) or on the right hand (south), that there be no conflict amongst brethren. But Lot chose to go the plain of Jordan where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to Hebron and settled in the plain of Mamre, where he built another altar to worship God.|$|E
25|$|Slivenski {{was part}} of two other memorable Hardcore TV moments that year. On December 13, he was {{scheduled}} to face Mr. Hughes but the lights unexpectedly went out, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> on again, the entire ECW locker room was engaged in a brawl in the ring. A week later, Slivenski was brought out by Terry Funk as a mock Sabu impersonator and attacked by Funk. When Sabu's then manager Paul E. Dangerously confronted Funk, he was chased off. In front of a sold-out crowd at the ECW Arena, Slivenski scored an upset victory over Pitbull #1 in his ECW debut at Holiday Hell '93 on December 26, 1993. When his opponent continued attacking him after the match, The Sandman came to his rescue. This match aired on ECW Hardcore TV three days later.|$|E

25|$|Hampshire Hawks were {{defeated}} by Nottinghamshire, in particular David Hussey and Ryan Sidebottom, {{to go down}} into Division Two {{in front of their}} home crowd. The visiting Nottinghamshire Outlaws batted first, and after a slow start where Anurag Singh and Stephen Fleming had accumulated forties to see them to 101 for 3, Hussey hit loose. He hit five sixes in a 53-ball 75 which, together with 26 off 13 balls from Mark Ealham, took Nottinghamshire to 248 for 5. Then rain intervened, cutting 25 overs off the Hampshire effort. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to bat, Hampshire were set 165 to win – and duly lost six wickets for 58 runs, Gareth Clough having two men bowled and captain Shane Warne lbw. Jono McLean hit 36 from number eight, but Hampshire were still taken out for 127 a ball before the end – Ryan Sidebottom finishing them off by having Billy Taylor caught for 0. Sidebottom thus finished with three for 13 from 23 balls.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} playing the second half against Wimbledon with ten men after the {{dismissal}} of Luzhny, Arsenal defeated their London rivals by three goals to one. Before the game away to Leeds United on 16 April 2000, both clubs observed a minute's silence to honour the two Leeds fans who were murdered in Istanbul. Wenger and his players then presented bouquets of flowers to their counterparts. Arsenal went ahead in the 21st minute – Henry beat defender Jonathan Woodgate for pace and scored his 20th goal of the season. Further goals by Keown, Kanu and Overmars resulted in a 4–0 win and lifted Arsenal above Leeds into third, with a better goal difference. Arsenal beat Watford and continued their strong finish to {{the season with a}} 1–0 win at Everton to move into second place. Wenger believed Manchester United, who retained their status as champions in April, had benefited from the league being [...] "organised" [...] in their favour: [...] "They had a winter break. They didn't play in the FA Cup. It was all wrong from the start. The break was good for them because {{at the same time we}} dropped points and so did the other teams. So <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> they had the psychological advantage." ...|$|E

Coming back {{to win a}} seven-game series when down by three games has only been accomplished by five teams {{in the history of}} the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL) came back from being down by three games to the Detroit Red Wings to win the 1942 Stanley Cup. The 1975 New York Islanders (NHL) did the same <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1975 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals. During their Cinderella run to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the Philadelphia Flyers (NHL) came back from three games down to defeat the Boston Bruins to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. [...] In the 2013–14 NHL Playoffs the Los Angeles Kings defeated the San Jose Sharks in the first round, on their way to the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals.

2500|$|Lewis and Sanders first {{approached}} Larry Sherman of Trax - a {{label that}} had a capital {{role in the development}} of house music - in 1984 or 1985, as the genre was beginning to take off. As titles in his catalogue were beginning to chart and the duo were unknown in the club scene, Sherman shrugged their demos off. State Street Records were also uninterested. At that time, the duo started attending the Art Institute of Chicago, and began to produce new music in its sound room. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to Sherman in 1988 with additional material, he agreed to put it out. Sanders and Lewis produced the album at Rax Trax, where they met Rick Barnes (who ran the studio) and Derek Brand, members of the Nicholas Tremulis Band. Although Lidell Townsell was enlisted to help the duo with production, they ended up doing it themselves. Regarding the recording, Sanders stated: [...] "Most of our stuff we played live except for the drum machine. Everything else we got so used to just playing, I guess just from the repetition, we didn't use a sequencer at all. We showed up at the studio, had our keyboards, hit [...] "Record." [...] It's kind of like a live session with the keyboards." [...] They recorded all the songs in one live session, quickly moving on from track to track.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During {{the middle of the}} match, Bill Alfonso, who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to Francine, who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when {{suddenly}} the lights in the arena went out. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of [...] "Terry!" [...] and [...] "Sabu!" [...] and [...] "Foley!" [...] and [...] "Thank You Shane!" [...] and of course [...] "E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued [...] "E-C-Dub" [...] chants.|$|E

2500|$|Peter May {{rejoined the}} team <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to Sydney to replay New South Wales, {{by far the}} strongest state side and the match was almost played at Test level. New South Wales were sent in to bat by May on a humid day with the ball {{swinging}} and patches on the wicket thanks to poor covering against the recent rain. Frank Tyson [...] (4/55) and Brian Statham (4/36), the new ball partnership of 1954-55, showed that they could still be very dangerous. Roy Swetman dropped Watson in the first over from Tyson, but caught him off Statham for a duck. Norm O'Neill was hit on the elbow by a rising Tyson delivery and retired hurt on 37/2. Neil Harvey made another 92 and fought back with fellow left-hander Neil Marks (42) as they took the score past 150 without further loss, but Tyson came off a short run at fast-medium pace and removed Harvey, Marks, Grahame Thomas and Richie Benaud as they crashed to 171/6 before stumps. O'Neill returned {{at the start of}} the new day, but was l.b.w. to Trevor Bailey (2/40) and Statham removed the tail and New South Wales were out for 215. Gordon Rorke (4/57) removed Peter Richardson l.b.w. first ball and Tom Graveney for 14 and generated great pace off his short run, but his long drag left him only 19 yards from the batsman when he bowled and he was very difficult to play. Trevor Bailey was hit repeatedly by Rorke, but stuck in for 54 and Peter May made a powerful 136 as they added 179 for the third wicket. The captain saw off Rorke and attacked the spinners, hitting the New South Wales captain Richie Benaud for six over mid-on and cracking drives through the covers with such ferocity that four fielders could not stop him hitting the boundary. May was 99 not out on the Saturday evening and returned on the Monday, but without the same certainty. Bailey went down the pitch to Jim Burke (1/30), missed and was stumped miles out of his ground, but the crowd shouted that Burke ought to be given a coconut because he shied the ball. Rorke caught May (136) with a beautiful ball that swung from leg to hit off stump and had Willie Watson leg before, then Benaud (5/83) spun through the tail to give him 50 wickets in the season and the MCC were out for 303. There was just time for New South Wales to reach 44/0 when the rain washed out the third and fourth days.|$|E
