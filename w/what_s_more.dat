However, its {{baseline wander}} introduced in the acquisition may result in misdiagnosis. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> recent advancements in the pulse variability analysis require more accuracy of baseline estimation. In this paper, a wavelet based cascaded adaptive filter (CAF) was presented to remove this drift. The CAF works in two stages. The first stage is a discrete Meyer wavelet approximation and the second stage is a cubic Spline estimation. The experimental results on 50 simulated and 200 real pulse signals demonstrate the powerful effect of CAF both in removing the baseline wander and in preserving the diagnostic information of pulse waveform, comparing with some traditional methods, such as cubic Spline estimation, morphology filter and Linear-phase FIR least-squares-error digital filter. In addition, this CAF is easy to be accomplished and needs no prior knowledge on pulse and its baseline drift. 1...|$|E

In order to obtain materials with desired magnetic properties, it is reasonable to start with inclusions with a Curie temperature TC, above room temperature. One of the candidate materials is MnSb. It was showed that bulk MnSb has TC of 587 K and the Mn 1 xSbx layers grown on GaAs reach a TC of 620 K. This indicates that MnSb can be a good compound to form ferromagnetic nano inclusions above room temperature. The XANES and EXAFS spectra at the Mn K edge were measured at Hasylab A 1 station using a single element germanium fluorescence detector. Additional spectrum of powdered MnSb standard sample was measured in transmission mode. The XMCD spectra at the Mn L 3, 2 edges and Sb M 5, 4 edges were measured at MAX lab beamline D 1011. The spectra were collected in the total electron yield mode with the samples remanently magnetized.

40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} unceasing human {{population}} growth and fast economic development, the global energy demand is also increasing unceasingly. Meanwhile, the increasing carbon dioxide emission has become a significant environmental problem. Building energy has now accounted for about 1 / 5 of the primary energy consumption all over the world. The number in China was 23. 39 % in 2009 {{and it is still}} growing fast. In particular, building sector has great potential of energy saving. With the development of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, the energy structure in China can be more reasonable. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> part of the heating demand can be covered by heat pump whose efficiency is much higher than electric heating and gas heating. 	The conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) cell is greatly influenced by its temperature. According to experimental results, every 1 °C rise in cell temperature reduces the conversion efficiency by about 0. 4 % for multi-crystalline cells. Therefore, many researches have been done to decrease the PV panel temperature to increase the performance. Different types of PV/T collectors were developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) energy. The main difference of these collectors is working media which can be air, water, refrigerant and heat pipe. 	When the air or the water was used as working media of PV/T collectors, it was usually heated to a high temperature for direct heating usage. This was actually on the opposite direction of conversion efficiency improvement. In this thesis, a PV panel was combined with a heat pump system. The refrigerant used in this work is propane (R 290) and it is an environmental friendly working fluid whose ODP and GWP is 0 and 3. The evaporator of the heat pump was fixed under the PV panel. This combination, which is called PV evaporator in the following, can improve the conversion efficiency by cooling the PV cells and absorb solar thermal energy to produce hot water with the help of heat pump at the same time. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> the temperature of refrigerant is constant and relatively low during evaporation, this is good for the performance of PV cells. Based on the concepts above, a test rig of PV/T heat pump system was designed and built. Experimental researches were taken under summer weather conditions of Trondheim. According to the experimental results, the conversion efficiency of the PV panel can reach 15. 5 % in the best case, it was increased by 6. 9 % compared with the nominal value. The efficiency was influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and angle of incidence. A higher ambient temperature leads to a lower efficiency. The influence of the solar irradiance is complicated, ordinarily, a higher solar radiation may cause a decline in efficiency. The PV evaporator can absorb heat both from solar radiation and environment, the heat-collecting efficiency ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 77 in the tests. The COP of the heat pump is greatly influenced by the condenser supply water temperature. COP decreases with the increasing condenser supply water temperature. Solar radiation and ambient temperature {{have a positive impact on}} COP. The average COP of the heat pump can reach 4. 3 when the water was heated from 14. 8 °C to 50. 6 °C. The fractional errors of the measured conversion efficiency, COP are 5 % and 5. 2 %. Simulation of the test rig was made by EES to study the performance of PV/T heat pump system at different places and climates. The effectiveness of the simulation was validated by comparing the simulated results and experimental results. Daily performance analysis on April 30 in Shanghai was done, and it indicated that a higher air temperature leads to a better comprehensive performance. Annual operation simulated results in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi were analyzed. Monthly average value of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed was adopted as the rated condition for annual performance evaluation. The annual average COP in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 3. 5, 2. 8 and 4. 4, respectively. And the annual average conversion efficiency in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 16. 4 %, 17. 3 %, 15. 5 %.

The tree grows easily: {{with a lot of}} light, and well drained soils, it produces a hard, rotproof wood for using in outside furniture, boat-building or as railway sleepers. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> the price is rising. The volume of supply from the main source of south-east Asia is falling, with the exploitation of natural forests being severely restricted if not prohibited, except in Myanmar. Despite this, the countries of the region still have a quasi-monopoly on the export of teak logs to western markets, and of value-added products from their craft workshops. The burgeoning domestic market is being supplied by small diameter logs from Africa and Latin America, a phenomenon which explains the expansion of teak plantations in these continents. Côte d Ivoire is the major exporter of teak outside of Asia, exporting 130, 000 m 3 annually from its 52, 000 hectares of plantations which are 90 % state owned. Togo is planning to use private investment to plant 4, 000 hectares in the coming five-year period. In the Caribbean, there are plantations covering 8, 000 hectares, in particular in Trinidad and Tobago. People should not get carried away in their enthusiasm for teak however. Prices are rising (from USD 400 to 500 - 459 to 573 per m 3 for mature logs), but the increase in supply will probably cause them to drop. Furthermore, investing in this type of plantation is a long-term affair with several constraints, most notably the prevailing land tenure system, and several prerequisites for success: there is need for care in selecting the best varieties for the given environment and the site nearest to markets. As in Asia, processing the wood on the spot could add significant value to the product. The Teaknet network is a useful source of information and research results and provides for exchange of plant materials and technical experiences. A good lead to follow.

40|$|Evidências empíricas apontam o valor do Método Rolfing de Integração Estrutural no Campo da psicologia. O trabalho de Ida P. Rolf é uma proposta holística, de organização da estrutura humana no campo gravitacional, pela reorganização do tecido miofascial, por toques especializados e educação pelo movimento. O objetivo deste trabalho é dar continuidade à investigação da natureza psicobiológica do método Rolfing e sua intersecção com o domínio da psicossomática. Estudou-se o alcance de questionários desenvolvidos em pesquisa-ação no NAPER (Núcleo de Atendimento, Pesquisa e Estudo em Rolfing, São Paulo, Brasil) e nas Escolas de Rolfing, no Brasil e nos Estados Unidos, onde o autor participou de um programa em que a elaboração, aplicação e avaliação dos questionários ocorriam simultaneamente. Os questionários foram usados nos processos de Rolfing de 874 clientes, sendo 714 do serviço de atendimento do NAPER e 160 clientes de classe das Escolas de Rolfing e, destes, 55, no Brasil e, 105, nos Estados Unidos. Foram avaliadas as respostas aos questionários das três amostras, isolada e comparativamente, tendo sido feita uma análise quantitativa das perguntas fechadas, utilizando-se o SPSS, e tendo aplicados testes estatísticos de acordo com o nível de mensuração das amostras. Realizou-se uma análise qualitativa das respostas às perguntas abertas em que se utilizou o SPAD. T, fazendo-se um levantamento das freqüências das palavras utilizadas nas respostas, agrupamentos das palavras por afinidade conceitual, além da busca e da análise do contexto em que foram utilizadas. Também foi feito o levantamento dos temas emergentes nas respostas e suas freqüências. Verificou-se que os questionários trouxeram dados que apresentam a dimensão psicobiológica do método Rolfing em todas as amostras, revelando-se eficientes no uso com profissionais formados, com alunos nas escolas e em diferentes culturas. Foram comparadas a localização, a intensidade e a periodicidade de dores relatadas, e notou-se tendência significativa para a diminuição da intensidade das dores antes e depois do processo, e diminuição na periodicidade tanto de dores recentes como crônicas em todas as localizações descritas. Nas Escolas, foi avaliada a percepção dos clientes quanto à sua Qualidade de Vida pelo WHOQOL-BREF, antes e depois do processo de Rolfing, com resultados significativos, corroborando os resultados apontados pelos questionários. O autor considera que o utilizar questionários representa atividade mental reflexiva, e que o emprego deles serve simultaneamente a propósitos de atendimento, de pesquisa e de educação, sendo o elo metodológico entre estas dimensões do trabalho, permitindo-se, assim, alavancar a percepção da dimensão psicobiológica do Rolfing e seu valor como metodologia em psicossomática. Foi feita uma revisão e uma proposta de uma bateria de questionários que possuem dois níveis: um, de perguntas fechadas e, outro, de perguntas abertas, que podem ser usados independentemente ou acoplados, e que atuam concomitantemente na investigação dos dados e eliciam a reflexão sobre a dimensão psicobiológica: um instrumento ao mesmo tempo de pesquisa e pedagógicosEmpirical {{evidence}} indicates {{the importance of}} the Rolfing Method of Structural Integration for the field of Psychology. Ida P. Rolf s work is a holistic approach of organizing the human body structure in the gravitational field by rebalancing the myofascia (connective tissue) through special touch and movement education. The objective of the study described herein is to provide a systematic and consistent method for investigating the psychobiological nature of Rolfing and its intersection with the domain of psychosomatics. The author studied the power of questionnaires that had been developed for clinical research at NAPER (Brazilian Rolfing Association s Center for Clinical Practice, Research and Studies on Rolfing) and at Rolfing schools in Brazil and the United States, where the author had participated in the simultaneous elaboration, application and evaluation of the questionnaires. The questionnaires were used in connection with the Rolfing processes of 874 clients in three groups: 714 at NAPER and 160 in the Rolfing schools (55 in Brazil and 105 in the US). The questionnaire responses were evaluated both within each and among all of these three groups. The responses to closed questions were subjected to an SPSS quantitative analysis, applying statistical tests appropriate to the metrics of the questions and responses themselves. The responses to open questions were qualitatively analyzed with an SPAD. T method: for particular words, the frequencies and contexts of their uses were tabulated; then, words were grouped by conceptual affinity, and the contexts in which they appeared were analyzed. The themes that emerged from the responses, as well as their frequencies, were noted. These analyses of the data gathered in response to the questionnaires demonstrated the presence of a psychobiological dimension of Rolfing and, <b>what</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> demonstrated to be an efficient tool for practitioners and students alike, regardless of cultural milieu. At the schools, clients perceptions concerning their quality of life before and after the Rolfing process were evaluated through the WHO-QOL questionnaire. The results were significant, and corroborated the indications of the NAPER results. The questionnaires also addressed the pre- and post-process intensity and frequency of reported pain; and indicated a significant decrease of both intensity and frequency of pain after the process. This was the case for both recent-onset and chronic pain, regardless of the location of the pain. The author posits that use of the questionnaires is, in and of itself, a mental reflexive activity an activity that makes salient the psychobiological dimension of Rolfing and it s value as a psychosomatic method. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more,</b> because the questionnaires further clinical, educational and research objectives simultaneously, their use highlights the relationship among those objectives. Based on his review of the evidence, the author sets forth a proposal for a revised questionnaire that comprises two levels, which could be explored independently or jointly.

The second consists of open questions, which elicits reflection upon the psychobiological dimension of the work.

40|$|There {{have been}} many discussions about a recent trend of tabloidization of news which has seen a shift from {{traditional}} news stories about politics and foreign affairs, to more entertainment-oriented stories about celebrities and scandals. <b>What</b> <b>s</b> <b>more</b> is that numerous {{studies have examined the}} parallel decline of international news. Some of the key previous studies reviewed include: Foreign News in the Media: International reporting in 29 countries by UNESCO, 1985; Tabloidization of News: A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-American and German Press Journalism by Esser, 1999; Tabloidization in the British Press: A Quantitative Investigation into Changes in British Newspapers, 1952 1997 by McLachlan & Golding, 2000; and Trends in Canadian Newspaper Coverage of International News, 1988 - 2000 : Editors' Assessments by Soderlund, Lee & Gecelovsky, 2002. Using the conceptual lens of tabloidization, this study examines changes in traditionally serious international newspaper content over time. Specifically, this study analyzes how international news coverage in the General and Business sections of two Canadian daily newspapers the Globe and Mail and Toronto Star has changed over a period of three decades 1986, 1996 and 2006. An examination into some of the key causes of tabloidization such as commercialized media, new technologies and concentration of ownership help to better understand the results. Quantitative content analysis is used to determine the amount and types of international news items being covered throughout the selected dates {{to see if there is}} a decline of serious international news and an increase in tabloidization of international news. The analysis is based on seven aspects indicating a process of tabloidization. The seven indicators are: Fewer international news stories; More pictures/less text; More entertainment stories; Fewer political/parliament news stories; Fewer front page international news items; More focus on the United States; and More newswire services being bylined. The main dependant variable of this study is international news coverage and is defined as news items centered on places outside of Canada, news involving Canadians abroad, or news involving foreigners in Canada. International news coverage is identified by dateline and text within each newspaper item. Coverage from the United States is paid particular attention given the abundant amount of American media crossing north to Canada. The findings demonstrate a process of tabloidization occurring over time according to many of the indicators measured, such as fewer international news items throughout the sampled sections and front pages, more visuals, more entertainment stories, and fewer political stories. Another key finding is the increased emphasis on news from the United States, particularly on financial and economic news. Endast sammandrag.

The age groups differed in the following respects: (i) 31 - 45 <b>s</b> <b>more</b> frequently attributed problems rendezvousing to the overrunning of previous activities, and to the spontaneous performance of additional tasks (‘side-stepping’); (ii) 31 - 45 <b>s</b> <b>more</b> frequently experienced lost opportunities associated with the failure to meet as initially agreed in the form of personal sacrifices; and (iii) 31 - 45 <b>s</b> <b>more</b> frequently changed plans for the rendezvous. The explanation for these differences suggested by the diaries is that commitments to spouse and children lead 31 - 45 s to pack their lives more tightly with activities than 18 - 30 s. Some implications for tailoring wireless navigation and related services to the 31 - 45 age group are discussed...|$|R
