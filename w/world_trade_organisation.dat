40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} food production, imports, and trade policy opportunities {{in terms of the}} special and differential treatment (SDT) in Pacific Island countries (PICs). It is revealed that stagnating per capita incomes and high incidence of poverty are lowering the quality of life among a significant proportion of the PIC population. PICs' well-being is likely to be further worsened by falling and stagnating food production and significant rises in food prices as a result of food imports that range between 14 to 29 percent of total imports. PICs' future development is likely to be hampered by the looming economic fallout arising from regional integration. Thus, ensuring food self-sufficiency is essential for improved well-being. In this regard, the PICs window of opportunity is to maximize the utility of the SDT under the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisations</b> (WTO) provisions. Urgent governmental attention is required in terms of calibrating regional country-specific composite measures of trade and development parameters so as to allow the capacity of the PICs to bargain for the SDT with greater clarity, strength and meaning...|$|R

25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation,</b> all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies.

He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect that there is no such thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|Public {{international}} law concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The sources for public {{international law}} development are custom, practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the Geneva Conventions. Public international law can be formed by international organisations, such as the United Nations (which was established after {{the failure of the}} League of Nations to prevent World War II), the International Labour Organisation, the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Organisation,</b> or the International Monetary Fund. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the International Court of Justice as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience. However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.|$|E
