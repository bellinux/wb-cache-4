[...] Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. [...] Despite decreasing the business and <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. [...] This is due to the financial burden to run the city's prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{successful}} second mayoral campaign in 1975, Rizzo campaigned under the slogan, [...] "He held {{the line on}} taxes". Soon after the election, he persuaded City Council to increase the city's <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> from 3.31% to 4.31%, {{one of the highest}} in the nation. The action infuriated Rizzo's opponents and led fiscal conservatives to join them in attempting to recall Rizzo from the mayor's office. Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal activist group that had {{played a key role in}} moving Philadelphia from Republican to Democratic control in the late 1940s and early 1950s, gathered the 250,000 signatures required. Polls showed Rizzo losing by a wide margin. Rizzo's allies counterattacked by challenging the validity of the signatures as well as the recall procedure itself. Then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared the Charter's recall provision unconstitutional by one vote. The decision was written by Chief Justice Robert N. C. Nix Jr., elected to the court with Rizzo's support in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|After taking office, Milliken was {{appointed}} to the House Banking and Currency Committee and introduced several bills in 1959, including one {{to increase the amount of}} other income allowed without causing a loss of social security benefits from $1,200 to $1,800. [...] Another bill was to allow the exemption of suburbanites from the Philadelphia <b>wage</b> <b>tax.</b> [...] During the year, he supported President Eisenhower's attempts to hold down federal spending, including numerous vetoes, in 66% of the votes and opposed those efforts [...] 34% of the time. [...] Out of thirty Pennsylvania congressmen, he tied for second place among those supporting economy in government. [...] As a result of these efforts, the budget year ending June 30, 1960, would show a small surplus of $1.2 billion and would be the last budget surplus that would not include the use of the surplus in the trust funds, such as Social Security. [...] Other significant legislation for the year included the approval by the House, 323-89, for Hawaii's admission into the Union, which Milliken supported. [...] However, the administration's proposed civil rights bill languished in the conservative dominated Rules Committee.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of a tax system is relevant to public health. <b>Wage</b> <b>taxes</b> are the predominant form of taxation in both Europe and the United States. Yet, high rates of wage taxation harm worker health particularly when <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are part of an}} overall regressive tax system. The causal mechanisms for the negative effect of <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> on public health occur by (i) pushing marginal workers into absolute poverty by payment of wage taxes; (ii) increasing working hours for low-wage workers; (iii) increasing levels of economic inequality by relatively higher tax and audit rates of persons with labor income; and (iv) reducing financial (and time) investment in children by overburdened workers. Optimal tax policy accordingly requires an evaluation of the cost of <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> levied on “health capital” of workers as well as financial capital...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}}, Republicans {{did well in}} Delaware County, giving Henry X. O'Brien about 60% of the vote for {{a seat on the}} state Supreme Court. [...] The GOP also carried local elections in 47 of 49 towns, leaving the party in a much better position than the previous year. The Democrats losing local offices in ten communities. In the city, the Democratic slate only carried the district attorney and controller slate by about 54%. O'Brien won statewide and Republicans were confident they could retake the governorship and U.S. senate seat up for grabs in 1962. After the election, Eyre commented: [...] "Philadelphia has long tried to move into Delaware County through the <b>wage</b> <b>tax.</b> The reapportionment question was just another form of potential annexation. But, why he (Green) brought it up again is a mystery; it certainly wasn't smart politically." [...] In December, 1961, with no action having been taken by the time the legislature adjourned, a group of local Democrats, led by Upper Providence Justice of the Peace Donald Kahn, proposed its own redistricting plan. The Democrats' map kept Philadelphia separate from the suburbs and moved eleven northern and western Delaware County communities, as well as five Montgomery County towns, to the Ninth Congressional District in Chester County, which would be separated from Lancaster County. The Seventh District would have consisted of the southern and eastern tier of the county and would have had a population of 422,000.|$|E
50|$|Counties, municipalities, {{and school}} districts levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> on {{personal}} income. Generally, the total <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with home rule charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a signaling explanation for unemployment. The basic {{idea is that}} employment at an unskilled job may {{be regarded as a}} bad signal. Therefore, good workers who are more likely to qualify for employment at a skilled job in the future are better off being unemployed than accepting an unskilled job. We present conditions under which all equilibria satisfying the Cho-Kreps intuitive criterion involve unemployment. However, there always exist budget balancing <b>wage</b> subsidies and <b>taxes</b> that eliminate unemployment. Also, for any unemployment equilibrium, either there always exists a set of Pareto improving <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> and subsidies, or we give conditions under which there exists a set of Pareto improving <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> and subsidies. ...|$|R

40|$|The author derives {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions for the}} intertemporal equalization of optimal tax rates. The conditions {{in the case of}} <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> include constant elasticity labor supply and constant relative risk aversion. <b>Wage</b> <b>taxes</b> should be low in times of relatively elastic labor supply or low risk aversion. The conditions in the case of capital taxes include perfect-foresight expectations and constant relative risk aversion. If foresight is imperfect, intertemporal equality will be impeded by a covariance term; if relative risk aversion is time-varying, next period's capital tax should have the same sign as this period's change in relative risk aversion.

50|$|The City of Philadelphia {{has its own}} local income {{taxation}} system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> from the salaries of their employees.

If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia <b>wage</b> <b>tax,</b> residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income tax (SIT).|$|E

50|$|During the Green Administration, {{the city}} budget had been balanced; {{the first few}} years of Goode's tenure caused the city to go into debt again, this time deeply, and the fiscal {{troubles}} continued throughout his tenure. In an attempt to re-balance the city's budget, Goode pushed through tax increases that raised the city's <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> to an all-time high of 4.96 percent. Yet despite this record tax increase, on the day Goode finally left office Philadelphia was only twenty-seven days away from being insolvent—bankrupt—and Moody's gave its municipal bonds junk bond ratings. His successors, Edward G. Rendell and John Street were able to reduce the city <b>wage</b> <b>tax</b> incrementally and impart a degree of fiscal health to the Philadelphia city government.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} cost {{of taxation}} {{has become an}} increasingly important consideration {{in the evaluation of}} alternative tax policy options. This paper provides a review of estimates of the efficiency costs of taxation and presents some new estimates for small open economies. The available studies suggest that, in closed economies, the distortions from taxation are highest for corporate taxes and lowest for <b>wage</b> <b>taxes.</b> This efficiency ranking of different taxes does not hold in small open economies. It is shown that, in a small open economy, this ranking is reversed. Personal income taxes are less distortionary than <b>wage</b> <b>taxes</b> primarily because the link between domestic saving and investment is severed. Corporate taxes are also less distortionary for a variety of factors, such as changes in depreciation levels, payments to foreigners and terms of trade. ...|$|R
