Clean as a hound's tooth, sweet as a nut. Full of life. The tale of the triumph of a courageous girl, backed by an inimitable office boy, and the downfall of the grafter are well planned and well rendered. The copy room set our mind flying back to our own 'cub' days. By the way, the paper {{on the wall of the}} traction company office is somewhat weird. A good, healthy, vigorous production in every sense." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good, but found fault with the plot itself. The reviewer states, [...] "This film story has melodramatic interest, and the acting is good, but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> the acid test.

500|$|One of Gilbert's {{favourite}} comic themes is {{the elevation}} of an unqualified person {{to a position of}} high responsibility. In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by [...] "never go to sea". In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in Pirates, and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph [...] "always voted at [...] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity. The [...] "commercial middle class" [...] (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed. In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl. The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a [...] "paternal" [...] Captain and the [...] "ethics... of all romanticism" [...] are accepted [...] "unflinchingly" [...] and taken to their logical conclusion: [...] "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> starkly out".|$|E

In Canada, the tiny seeds are usually sown {{in the early spring}} after the last frost and may be started indoors in April.

RSBI brings {{together}} several communities to tackle the challenges associated with integrating data and representing complex biological investigations, employing multiple OMICS technologies. Currently, RSBI includes environmental genomics, nutrigenomics and toxicogenomics communities, where independent activities are underway to develop databases and establish data communication standards within their respective domains. The RSBI working group has been conceived as a "single point of focus" for these communities, conforming to general accepted view that duplication and incompatibility should be avoided where possible. This endeavour has aimed to synergize insular solutions into one common terminology between biologically driven standardisation efforts and has also resulted in strong collaborations and shared understanding between those in the technological domain.
