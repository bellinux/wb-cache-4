25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here and now. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
500|$|In 1966, the Carnegie Corporation named President Love one of {{the best}} college Presidents in the country. President Love changed the {{structure}} of the college, developing its divisions into professional schools, which would allow them to be accredited. The schools were developed into colleges, which increased the possibility of SDSC of becoming a university. He reflected on San Diego State’s progress in a Time magazine article: [...] "Though <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> a college, we are in deed and in fact a university." ...|$|E

5000|$|For our values, <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> derided as [...] "pirates". For {{our hope}} {{that every person}} may be free to access all of human knowledge, <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> <b>called</b> [...] "pirates". For our belief that one need not ask {{permission}} to participate in governance, industry, culture, {{and other aspects of}} society, <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> <b>called</b> [...] "pirates". For our insistence that citizens should not be surveilled and distrusted as if they <b>are</b> criminals, <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> <b>called</b> [...] "pirates". For our rejection of authority and profit-seeking when it does not serve the common good of all people, <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> <b>called</b> [...] "pirates".We reclaim this label of [...] "pirate" [...] and abjure its derogatory, incendiary implication. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> Pirates. <b>We</b> stand for the liberty, equality, and solidarity of all human beings, and against all threats they may face.|$|R

500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] ("Awake", <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> by {{the voice}} [...] ), is a chorale fantasia {{based on the}} first verse of the chorale, a common feature of Bach's earlier chorale cantatas. The cantus firmus is sung by the soprano. The {{orchestra}} plays independent material mainly based on two motifs: a dotted rhythm and an ascending scale [...] "with syncopated accent shifts". The lower voices add in unusually free polyphonic music images such as the frequent calls [...] "wach auf!" [...] (wake up!) and [...] "wo, wo?" [...] (where, where?), and long melismas in a fugato on [...] "Halleluja".|$|E

At 2003, right before his inauguration, he described his plan as [...] "I will root the method of discussion inside the government.", and added, [...] "discussion should be familiarized until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> 'Republic of discussion'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conservative scholars, on {{the other}} hand, object to the way {{canonical}} criticism bypasses [...] "vexed questions relating to the historical validation of revelation." [...] Oswalt suggests that canonical critics blithely [...] "separate fact and meaning" [...] when they suggest that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> {{to submit to the}} inspired truth of the text, despite the community's inability to admit where they really got it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving written use of {{the term}} {{can be found in the}} diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: [...] "I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs to me that it is no wonder <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> 'Tar Heels'." ...|$|E
2500|$|America needs Orthodoxy, without Orthodoxy {{becoming}} Americanized. Orthodoxy {{must continue}} to develop in spirituality and maturity, growing gradually and appropriately toward a developed polity. I am concerned that aggressive attempts toward premature separation from the mother churches of the old lands will result in disarray and schism. [...] Instead, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> by the Lord to continue in humble growth and obedience to our organic link with the Patriarchates. We hope and pray for {{the direction of the}} Holy Spirit in the future life of our church.|$|E
50|$|The whole mental performance, however {{automatic}} and semi-conscious it may be, that leads {{up from a}} problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, <b>is</b> what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>calling</b> an abductive inference.|$|R

2500|$|Novalis' whole {{works are}} based upon an idea of education: [...] "We are on a mission: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> upon to educate the earth." [...] It {{has to be made}} clear that {{everything}} is in a continual process. It is the same with humanity, which forever strives towards and tries to recreate a new Golden Age – a paradisaic Age of harmony between man and nature that was assumed to have existed in earlier times. This Age was described by Plato, Plotinus and Franz Hemsterhuis, the last of whom was an extremely important figure for the German Romantics.|$|E
2500|$|The Baltimore Catechism, the {{official}} catechism {{authorized by the}} Catholic bishops of the United States between 1885 and 1965, statet: [...] "That is why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> Roman Catholics; {{to show that we}} are united to the real successor of St. Peter" [...] (Question 118), and refers to the Church as the [...] "Roman Catholic Church" [...] under Questions 114 and 131. There are efforts of conservative Catholics to keep alive teachings of this catechism that were not retained in the Post-Vatican II catechism published in 1992, like [...] "Roman Catholic Church" [...] that has not appeared in the Catechism of the Catholic Church since 1992.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{political}} term, [...] "Scandinavia" [...] {{was first used}} by students agitating for Pan-Scandinavianism in the 1830s. The popular usage of the term in Sweden, Denmark and Norway as a unifying concept became established {{in the nineteenth century}} through poems such as Hans Christian Andersen's [...] "I am a Scandinavian" [...] of 1839. After a visit to Sweden, Andersen became a supporter of early political Scandinavism. In a letter describing the poem to a friend, he wrote: [...] "All at once I understood how related the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians are, and with this feeling I wrote the poem immediately after my return: 'We are one people, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> Scandinavians!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Marian devotions are {{prominent}} within the Roman Catholic tradition. Pope Paul VI began his Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus saying, [...] "From {{the moment when}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> to the See of Peter, we have constantly striven to enhance devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary".|$|R
60|$|The {{arguments}} {{became so}} warm {{that it was}} evident Colonel Gansevoort {{would be forced to}} come to some decision regarding the matter, and so he did on this same day when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> out on the parade-ground, being formed in a hollow square.|$|R

2500|$|Some Conservative Christians {{believe that}} the use of sex toys is immoral. The Southern Baptist preacher Dan Ireland has been an outspoken critic of such devices and has fought to ban them on {{religious}} and ethical grounds. Ireland has stated [...] "There are moral ways and immoral ways to use a firearm ... There is no moral way to use one of these devices." [...] According to Ireland, [...] "Sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves....These devices should be outlawed because they are conducive to promiscuity, because they promote loose morals and because they entice improper and potentially deadly behaviors." [...] On the other hand Heidi Johnson, a Lutheran Christian pastor, teaches that [...] "in the Christian tradition, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> to love God with all our heart, strength, mind, and soul...Sex toys are presented as a medium to engage in body love, self care, and exploring your sexuality as one of the ways we love God with all of our holistic being." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2002 {{commencement}} address, {{he described}} his then-current NASA activities as follows: “I am drawing pictures of space vehicles on Mars, but now I'm living inside them, and actually pretending we are ON Mars. I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure. If you let other people say 'it can't be done,' I can promise you, you will be 50 years old like me one day, and we will STILL be sending tin cans around the Earth, round and round going nowhere.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of [...] "chrismation" [...] (baptism with oil) {{appears to have}} developed {{in the early church}} during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration. The earliest surviving account of such an act seems to be the letter written [...] "To Autolycus" [...] by Theophilus, bishop of Antioch. In it, he calls the act [...] "sweet and useful", punning on khristós ( [...] , [...] "anointed") and khrēstós ( [...] , [...] "useful"). He seems to go on to say [...] "wherefore <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God", and [...] "what person on entering into this life or being an athlete is not anointed with oil?" [...] The practice is also defended by Hippolytus in his [...] "Commentary on the Song of Songs" [...] and by Origen in his [...] "Commentary on Romans". Origen opines that [...] "all of us may be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches".|$|E
5000|$|After The Neurotics I {{got this}} band {{together}} with my best friends, {{so it was}} an all-girl band. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> The Venarays. The name came from the word venary which means actively hunting out sex! We began {{as a way of}} having fun with each other.|$|R
