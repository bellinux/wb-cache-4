Scarcely had he seen Eisenkopf than he darted like the wind to the stable and flung himself on the horse's back. In another moment he was away over the mountain, with Eisenkopf running fast behind him.|$|E

I must depend on my own resources. I have a retainer, I can tell you, my lord, from the 'Rigdum Funidos,' in my pocket, {{and it is in}} my power to keep up such a crackling of jokes and sarcasms that a very different view would soon be entertained in Europe of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> than is now the fashion.

6000|$|Some {{time after}} the petite guerre of Issy, the capital celebrated the fête of the Trocadero. The Trocadero, you may remember, was the {{fortress}} of Cadix, carried by assault, under {{the order of the}} Dauphin, in the war of the late Spanish revolution. This government, which has destroyed all the statues of the Emperor, proscribed his family, and obliterated every visible mark of his reign in their power, has had the unaccountable folly of endeavouring to supplant the military glory acquired under Napoleon by that of Louis Antoine, Dauphin of France! A necessary consequence of the attempt, is a concentration of all the military souvenirs of the day in this affair of the Trocadero. Bold as all this will appear to one who has not the advantage of taking a near view of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> it has even been exceeded, through the abject spirit of subserviency in those who have the care of public instruction, by an attempt to exclude even the name of the Bonaparte from French history. My girls have shown me an abridgment of the history of France, that has been officially prepared for the ordinary schools, {{in which there is no}} sort of allusion to him. The wags here say, that a work has been especially prepared for the heir presumptive, however, in which the Emperor is a little better treated; being spoken of as [...] "a certain Marquis de Bonaparte, who commanded the armies of the king." ...|$|E

Moreover, I do not consider that our journey will be altogether unattended by danger. From what I have heard of de Tulle, he is a man who never forgives, and will pursue his object with the pertinacity of a bloodhound. He has failed in his first attempt, but there is no reason why he should not renew it, confident, perhaps, that if successful the king, though he may feel it necessary to feign much anger for a time, will finally forgive him and take him into favour again, especially as his family would bring all their influence to bear to bring this about. Doubtless, he will be kept perfectly informed of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here.</b> There are several forests to be traversed on the way, and these are, for the most part, the haunts of robber bands; and, should the carriage be found overturned, and the baron and his daughter missing, it would be put down as their work.

50|$|Nearing a trench, a demonic looking face {{manifests itself}} and starts {{rambling}} about a savior, and that Simon {{can be that}} savior. This {{is one of the}} last vampires, a mystic race that stood against demons. Simon begins to wonder <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> and suspects that there is something much much more sinister happening at the trenches. Along the way, Simon begins to unravel and discover bits and pieces of information about what is going on. This leads him to Jonas Zimmerman, the person behind the monstrosity that has been going on. Eventually, the player travels through trenches, old ruins (where he first encounters Zimmerman, but is tricked) and finally the stronghold where Zimmerman was last located. At the basement lab of the stronghold, the player discovers a mechanical walking tank created by the Vampires. Using it, Simon proceeds to a showdown with Zimmerman who commandeers a Scorpion-shaped walking tank ten times the size of Simon's tank.|$|E
