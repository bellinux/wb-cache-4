25|$|Dystheistic {{speculation}} {{arises from}} {{consideration of the}} problem of evil — the question of why God, who is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, would allow evil to exist in the world. Koons notes that this is only a theological problem for a eutheist, since a dystheist would not find the existence of evil (or God's authorship of it) to be an obstacle to theistic belief. In fact, the dystheistic option would be a consistent non-contradictory response to the problem of evil. Thus Koons concludes that the problem of theodicy (explaining how God can be good despite the apparent contradiction presented in the problem of evil) does not pose a challenge to all possible forms of theism (i.e., that the problem of evil does not present a contradiction to someone who <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God exists but that he is not necessarily good).|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

Digital Spy reported that Sylvie <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> her grandson, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) is Stan until the song, Unforgettable by Nat King Cole begins playing and she recognises her ex-husband, before dancing with him. They revealed that Cora would devastated by this and furious when Sylvie leaves the following day and Stan returns to her.

Stan will also decide to bring his wedding day forward due to his short time left and they prepare to marry. Viewers watched Stan unable to marry Cora due to poor health on 9 April 2015, but plan to reschedule for the following day. However, Stan was still too ill and did not marry Cora. Stan's death begun a new storyline for Cora which saw her 'leave' Walford, but actually become homeless.|$|E
500|$|Saprang was an {{extremely}} vocal critic of those who he perceived as his political opponents. [...] In an interview with Thai Rath (Thailand's most popular newspaper) on 8 April 2007, he called an unspecified enemy a [...] "mad dog" [...] who he claimed was destroying the monarchy. [...] He {{said that it was}} necessary to shoot the dog with a machine gun. [...] In the same interview, he threatened violent response to the [...] "bold words that came from the mouths of evil people who did not know restraint". [...] He urged decisive action, so that the public <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> good had triumphed over evil.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the program}} {{received}} widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary W.Michael Blumenthal wrote, [...] "I {{do not believe}} the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." [...] Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill was attached to the bank omnibus bill, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10, 1978.|$|E

500|$|In United States v. Mendenhall (1980), the Court {{held that}} a person is seized only when, by means of {{physical}} force or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he was not free to leave. In Florida v. Bostick (1991), the Court ruled {{that as long as the}} police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required, the police contact is a [...] "citizen encounter" [...] that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment. If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} casting Hirsch, Ioan Gruffudd was cast as Dr. Henry Morgan. [...] Miller wanted the actors {{to read the}} script {{so that he could}} see whether the {{audience}} <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the man had been alive for over 200 years. The search for an actor to portray Henry was more difficult than Miller expected. [...] Miller and Fiorentino unsuccessfully auditioned actors from New York City, Los Angeles, Canada, London, Australia, and South Africa for the role, but the role was uncast. One day, Miller noticed Gruffudd in the carpool lane while they picked up their children from preschool. [...] For Miller, Gruffudd's period work, such as in the series Horatio Hornblower, made him an obvious selection for the role. [...] Gruffudd liked the script and felt that he could portray Henry. [...] The story, the science fiction element, and the believability also attracted Gruffudd to the role.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics and}} {{publications}} online believed the music video and lyrics to [...] "Taboo" [...] {{was the reason}} for Koda's transition to a more sexual image, respectively. Tony Sokol from KpopStarz.com listed [...] "Taboo" [...] alongside [...] "Juicy", [...] "V.I.P.", [...] "Shake It Up", and [...] "Lollipop" [...] as her sexiest videos to date. Regarding [...] "Taboo", Sokol felt that the music video emphasized Koda's self-described style [...] "Ero kawaii". Ero Kawaii was first established by Koda in her music video for [...] "Cutie Honey" [...] where she became the first Japanese musician to wear lingerie in a music video. J.R. Taylor from Coed said that [...] "Freaky" [...] and [...] "Taboo" [...] were [...] "important contributions" [...] to Koda's sexual image and Japanese music. Regarding Japanese music, Taylor felt [...] "Freaky" [...] and [...] "Taboo" [...] help regain sexual imagery in music videos and the Japanese scene, and that [...] "many <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Koda's image is more important than her Urban tunes".|$|E

500|$|Robert Rodriguez {{was offered}} the chance to direct, but turned down the offer due to his {{commitment}} on The Faculty, despite liking Smith's script. Smith originally suggested Tim Burton to direct his script, and Burton signed on with a pay-or-play contract of $5million. Warner Bros. originally planned on a theatrical release date for summer 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in Action Comics. Nicolas Cage, a comic book fan, signed on as Superman with a $20million pay-or-play contract, believing he could [...] "reconceive the character." [...] Peters felt Cage could [...] "convince audiences he [...] came from outer space." [...] Burton explained Cage's casting would be [...] "the first time you <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nobody could recognize Clark Kent as Superman, he [...] could physically change his persona." [...] Kevin Spacey was approached {{for the role of}} Lex Luthor, while Christopher Walken was Burton's choice for Brainiac, a role also considered for Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman. Sandra Bullock, Courteney Cox and Julianne Moore had been approached for Lois Lane, while Chris Rock was cast as Jimmy Olsen. Michael Keaton confirmed his involvement, but when asked if he would be reprising his role as Batman from Burton's Batman films, he would only reply, [...] "Not exactly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Fabiola Hinojosa, of Televisa Espectáculos stated that the album [...] "shows that despite being a rocker at heart, she has no problem recording in another genre and experiment with new rhythms." [...] Hinojosa also praised the rock song [...] "No Puedo Parar", arguing that [...] "if someone who never before had heard another song from her <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she [...] only performs in the rock genre". Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo said that [...] "Guzmán is back and wants to reclaim her place on the music market." [...] Rodríguez also reminded that Guzmán keeps trying to incorporate new or alternative rhythms to her music even if the results are not commercially successful, such as her albums Cambio de Piel (1996) produced by Spanish musician Carlos Narea, or Lipstick (2004), helmed by American artist Desmond Child, and A + No Poder is no exception, since the [...] "Queen of Rock in Mexico" [...] includes songs that [...] "hark back to {{the era of the}} nineties, but so potentiated with harder songs where the guitars, drums and her hoarse voice come together in musical chords." [...] Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos referred to this album as a [...] "well balance between rock and pop" [...] that shows Guzmán's excentric side who opted for a rock album with some ballads and new rhythms such as reggaeton.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Baum {{lived in}} Aberdeen, which was {{experiencing}} a drought, {{and he wrote}} a witty story in his [...] "Our Landlady" [...] column in Aberdeen's The Saturday Pioneer about a farmer who gave green goggles to his horses, causing them {{to believe that the}} wood chips that they were eating were pieces of grass.

2500|$|Although Milton {{does not}} {{directly}} mention divorce, critics posit theories on Milton's view of divorce based on inferences found within the poem, and, of course, the tracts on divorce Milton wrote earlier in his life.

Discussing Paradise Lost, Biberman entertains the idea that [...] "marriage is a contract made by both {{the man and the}} woman". Based on this inference, Milton <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> both man and woman would have equal access to divorce, as they do to marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Lakers scout {{and former}} teammate Brian Shaw mediated between a furious O'Neal and Bryant.

Bryant, still disappointed at the support he received over the summer, told O'Neal, [...] "You're supposed to be my friend." [...] Shaw questioned why he <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> when Bryant did not join the team for dinners on the road, failed to attend O'Neal's wedding though invited, and did not invite a single teammate to his own wedding.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his aura of {{experience}} and pro-activity, Scrimgeour proves to be little better than Fudge, prioritizing appearances over truth {{in the war against}} Voldemort. He seeks to raise the wizarding population's morale by asking Harry, who has been labelled as the [...] "Chosen One", to work for the Ministry, so that the public <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Harry supports the Ministry's actions against Voldemort. This becomes a source of conflict between the Minister and Dumbledore, who does not support this idea. Harry also rejects the role, primarily because of his own antagonistic history with the Ministry, and because of the Ministry's questionable treatment of Dumbledore and Stan Shunpike. Scrimgeour makes a short appearance, looking tired and grim due to the pressures of his position, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows at The Burrow with Dumbledore's will; a final argument promptly breaks out between Harry and him.|$|E

2500|$|Yulia Latynina {{wrote in}} The Moscow Times that events in South Ossetia were {{unfolding}} according to last year's scenario. As {{soon as the}} U.S. Vice President Joe Biden had announced that the United States would not provide arms to Georgia, the South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity claimed that Tskhinvali had come under fire from the Georgian village of Nikozi. Latynina argued: [...] "Considering the fact that South Ossetian forces had already wiped Nikozi off the map, his statement sounded a bit strange." [...] It {{would be impossible to}} repeat last year’s scenario again, because in 2008 the world didn't pay {{attention to the fact that}} before the war started, South Ossetian forces were shelling Georgian territory while declaring their readiness to launch a [...] "counterstrike" [...] against Georgian cities. Latynina concluded that if the conflict was renewed, nobody <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Kokoity had started the war; everyone would conclude that it had been Putin.|$|E

US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit {{the existence of the}} missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. The next day at 10:00pm EDT, the US raised the readiness level of SAC forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15minutes' notice. One eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba, and Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status. Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so that it <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the US was serious. Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 percent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Constitutional Court {{announced}} {{the results of}} the recount on 12 October 2009.

Boukoubi expressed [...] "full satisfaction", saying that [...] "right and the law have prevailed" [...] and that Bongo would [...] "get down to all the problems of the Gabonese people and make Gabon into an emerging country". Yvette Rekangalt, a minor opposition candidate, dismissed the ruling, saying that the Constitutional Court was [...] "like the Leaning Tower of Pisaalways tilted in one direction."
