5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area <b>was</b> <b>cheap.</b> Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
25|$|By the 1930s, wind {{generators}} {{for electricity}} were common on farms, {{mostly in the}} United States where distribution systems {{had not yet been}} installed. In this period, high-tensile steel <b>was</b> <b>cheap,</b> and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers.|$|E

25|$|Around 1960, {{the first}} diesel-hydraulic were produced. Other {{builders}} {{had shown that}} a type of hydraulic transmission, called a ‘multi-stage torque converter’, <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> to buy, needed very little maintenance and was very easy to use. YEC immediately found customers for these locomotives and {{increased the number of}} designs available.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1880s, {{the area}} was a marshy {{floodplain}} that {{was used as a}} dumping ground. Fumes from the glue factories along Jamaica Bay would usually blow upwind into Brownsville. This place was inconveniently far enough from Manhattan that the affluent refused to move to Brownsville, but the land <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> enough that tenements could be built for the poor there.|$|E
25|$|The PIK-11 Tumppu ("Mitten") was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} sport aircraft {{developed in}} Finland in the 1950s. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane of conventional design with an enclosed cockpit and fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. It {{was to be}} the first powered aircraft produced by Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho, with the objective being building an aircraft for club use that <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> to build and easy to fly.|$|E

25|$|While the Series 200 {{was more}} commercially attractive, {{with no more}} Series 100 being ordered, sales were still slow. While the Herald <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> {{compared}} to its major competitors, and in the 200 series had a roomy cabin, the Friendship could carry a larger payload and both the Friendship and the Avro 748 had better performance, resulting in superior long-term economics. By 1963, only 35 Heralds had been sold compared with over 240 Friendships.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} Pennsylvania Avenue {{provided}} an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The {{construction of an}} expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose. Relations {{between the president and}} Congress were strained, and Jackson {{did not want to see}} the Capitol out his window, though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> government land.|$|E
25|$|Amenities at Warners {{were few}} {{compared}} to the prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Bogart thought that the Warners wardrobe department <b>was</b> <b>cheap,</b> and often wore his own suits in his movies. In High Sierra, Bogart used his own pet dog Zero to play his character's dog, Pard. Bogart's disputes with Warner Bros. over roles and money {{were similar to those}} the studio waged with other high-spirited, less-than-obedient stars such as Bette Davis, James Cagney, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland.|$|E

60|$|A {{correspondent}} {{has written}} me an able and interesting {{letter in the}} matter of some allusions of mine to the subject of communal kitchens. He defends communal kitchens very lucidly {{from the standpoint of the}} calculating collectivist; but, like many of his school, he cannot apparently grasp that there is another test of the whole matter, with which such calculation has nothing at all to do. He knows it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> if a number of us ate at the same time, so as to use the same table. So it would. It would also <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> if a number of us slept at different times, so as to use the same pair of trousers. But the question <b>is</b> not how <b>cheap</b> <b>are</b> we buying a thing, but what are we buying? It <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> to own a slave. And it <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> still to <b>be</b> a slave.|$|R

25|$|In some {{consumer}} electronic equipment, {{notably in}} television sets {{in the era}} of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> and worked with both AC and DC.|$|E
25|$|The immobility of {{the trench}} warfare characterizing the First World War {{led to a}} need for a powerfully armed {{military}} engine that would be at the same time protected from enemy fire and could move on the extremely irregular terrain of battlefields. Barbed wire especially posed a considerable threat as it <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> and easy to install, extremely effective at slowing or stopping an offensive by troops against protected fire, and very difficult to eliminate, even with artillery. Special machines were considered to attempt to eliminate this problem: armoured, armed vehicles, with a capacity to flatten or otherwise eliminate barbed-wire lines.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the war, the government recalled the silver pengő coins (deadline: 31 January 1942) to prevent personal hoarding. These were replaced by newly designed aluminium coins. Later the cupronickel 10, 20 and 50 fillér coins were recalled as well, moreover, even the bronze 1 and 2 fillér coins disappeared after a time. First, they were replaced by steel, later - {{in the case of the}} 2 fillér - with zinc coins. The war coins were redesigned by Lajos Berán. As the war escalated, none of the above metals <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> enough to mint coins. The solution was the issuing of low denomination paper money (see there).|$|E

25|$|The seaboard colonial {{settlements}} gave {{priority to}} land ownership for individual farmers, {{and as the}} population grew they pushed westward for fresh farm land. Unlike Britain, where {{a small number of}} landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America <b>was</b> <b>cheap,</b> easy and widespread. Land ownership brought a degree of independence as well as a vote for local and provincial offices. The typical New England settlements were quite compact and small—under a square mile. Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues, namely who would rule. Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River valley, and northern New England (which was a move to the north, not the west).|$|E
25|$|The Eltham {{district}} {{had been}} settled since the 1850s; {{some of these}} early pioneers had used mud bricks to build their farmhouses, but the method had long been abandoned. Jörgensen saw value in the building technique. The local soils appeared suitable for both adobe (mudbrick) and pisé de terre (rammed earth) and it <b>was</b> <b>cheap,</b> so he set his students to work. He dispatched Arthur Munday, to the State Library in Melbourne to research the technique. There was little written material available, as the methods has been handed down from father to son. Arthur finally found {{in the writings of}} the ancient Roman historian Pliny some of the information they were looking for.|$|E
25|$|The Winchester Liberator is a 16-gauge, four-barrelled shotgun, {{similar to}} a scaled-up four-shot {{double-action}} derringer. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that <b>was</b> <b>cheap</b> to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective {{in the hands of}} someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.|$|E
