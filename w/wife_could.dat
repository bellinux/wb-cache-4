5|$|Bauer and his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> to {{make the}} long journey at Josef's expense in 1909. They chose to travel through Germany and on to Italy based on his {{readings}} of medieval towns during a 1902 visit to Germany with his father. The couple visited Verona, Florence, Siena and spent two months in Volterra. They continued through Naples and Capri, spending the winter in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{set up the}} California Motion Picture Company (CMPC) in San Rafael in 1912 for {{the purpose}} of {{shooting}} promotional footage of the automobiles he was selling. He determined that his pretty <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> star in movies made by his company. By 1914, Middleton and Michelena were making three major films at the same time.|$|E
5|$|We {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that the <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Restrictions on {{the number}} of {{soldiers}} who could marry were eased, and all soldiers' <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> accompany their husbands when they changed station (though not on campaign). However, there was official and practical discouragement of soldiers (and officers) who wished to marry while young.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be demonstrative, John, or I shall faint, and {{you will}} have to carry me out; and if that burden were laid upon you, you would reverse your last speech, and exclaim, 'Mother, ten <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> hardly be worse to me than you are!'" ...|$|R
50|$|Several of the town's hotels, {{including}} the Marine Hotel on Min-y-Mor and the Caerwylan Hotel on Min-y-Traeth, {{date from the}} period after Porthmadog's new harbour was developed in 1811, when prosperous sea captains invested in properties where their <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> provide accommodation during the summer months.|$|R
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton that his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was {{from that time}} forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Hindu law allowed {{polygamy}} if {{the first}} <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> not bear a son.|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband did}} not drink enough to {{complain}} of, {{but he liked}} to gamble {{and he had been}} fleeced by a crooked game in Jack Martin's saloon. Other <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> make the same complaints. It was God's blessing for such women that Ranger Steele had come to Linrock.|$|R

25|$|Priests' <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> {{nominally}} divorce {{their husbands}} {{in order to}} get jobs to support their families. Priests could be seen in rags in front of churches begging for alms and reportedly it could occur where priests had to mount the pulpit wearing their underclothes for lack of any other clothing that they owned.|$|R
25|$|On December 19, 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had {{initiated}} {{the policies of}} perestroika and glasnost, called Sakharov {{to tell him that}} he and his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> return to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In 1662 the viceroy {{ordered a}} change in the route of the {{procession}} of Corpus so that it would pass in front of the palace, where his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> view it from her balcony. The chapter of the cathedral made strong protests, and the Court not only disapproved the viceroy's decision, but also fined him twelve thousand ducats.|$|E
25|$|The Rig Veda {{mentions}} {{that during the}} Vedic period, a man could {{have more than one}} wife. The practice is attested in epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Dharmashastras permit a man to marry women of lower castes provided that the first wife was of equal caste. Despite its existence, it was most usually practiced by men of higher castes and higher status. Common people were only allowed a second marriage if the first <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> not bear a son.|$|E
5000|$|John Hope Smith {{was married}} to an African woman from the Fante tribe. Her name was Fannie Smith. The Asante of Africa {{believed}} that they were receiving hostility from the British because Fannie was manipulating her husband against the Asante. This goes to show that African <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> have advantages as political advocates.|$|R
5000|$|At the Detroit track Mary Steedman met jockey Johnny [...] "Pug" [...] Bacon. They married soon afterward. They competed {{together}} at Hazel Park, now defunct, in Michigan. In 1972 the track ruled that husbands and <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> not ride against each other. Combined with added marital difficulties Bacon divorced {{her husband in}} 1972. Pug Bacon died in a 1977 auto accident.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legend of}} Meicuchuca and the snake {{tells the story}} of the zipa who already had many wives. Polygamy was common {{practice}} with the Muisca and the higher the rank, the more <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> be held. The highest position of zipa could allow to have and sustain 300 wives, while the lower rank cacique [...] "only" [...] made 100 wives possible.|$|R
25|$|Also in 794, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 776â€“797) {{decided to}} {{separate}} from his first wife, Maria of Amnia, and to marry Maria's kubikularia (Lady-in-waiting), Theodote, a cousin of Theodore the Studite. Although the Patriarch may initially have resisted this development, as a divorce without proof of adultery {{on the part of}} the <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> be construed as illegal, he ultimately gave way. The marriage of Constantine and Theodote was celebrated in 795, although not by the patriarch, as was normal, but by a certain Joseph, a priest of Hagia Sophia.|$|E
25|$|He left Yorkshire {{at the end}} of the 2010 {{season after}} mutual {{agreement}} to terminate his contract a year early. This was so that he and his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> return to South Africa to be closer to family. In July 2011, following Yorkshire's run of poor form, Rudolph returned to Yorkshire CCC for the last six games of the season. In his first game back against Lancashire he scored 12 and 35 in a loss against Lancashire CCC. In his second county game against Hampshire CCC he scored 99 before being caught off Imran Tahir.|$|E
25|$|For a Brahmana, {{only one}} <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> rank {{as the chief}} consort who {{performed}} the religious rites (dharma-patni) along with the husband. The chief consort had to be of an equal caste. If a man married several women from the same caste, then eldest wife is the chief consort. Hindu kings commonly {{had more than one}} wife and are regularly attributed four wives by the scriptures. They were: Mahisi who was the chief consort, Parivrkti who had no son, Vaivata who is considered the favorite wife and the Palagali who was the daughter of the last of the court officials.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I 'm {{going to}} have Will; I asked him and he said, 'All right.' He 's going to preach Sundays, {{and work on the}} farm the rest of the time. Well, he is, so you need n't laugh, for we 've made all our plans," [...] said Maud with comical dignity as she tried the effect of an old white bonnet, {{wondering}} if farmers' <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> wear ostrich feathers when they went to meeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} of any still-existing {{remains of the}} crew members has been considered. This would permit their Jewish burial in Israel as Judaism does not recognize burial at sea and requires burial in earth. To date crew members' families have held a ceremony in a ship over the submarine's remnants. The Rabbinical authorities had to solve complicated problems of Jewish law before the crew members' <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> be declared officially widows, {{so that they could}} remarry.|$|R
50|$|Vistilia was {{accordingly}} {{tried by}} the Roman Senate for immorality. Her husband, Titidius Labeo, {{asked why he}} had not tried to enforce the statutory penalty, stated the consultation period (which was 60 days) had not yet expired. The senate decided to prosecute only Vistilia (under Roman law, husbands who did not immediately punish adulterous <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> be tried as pimps). Vistilia {{was found guilty of}} prostitution and she was deported to the Greek island of Seriphos.|$|R
25|$|In {{a region}} and age {{dominated}} by armed traders, Msiri was very successful. His {{control of the}} trade routes between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean took ruthlessness and arms (and over his neighbours, Msiri had what would be called in the west â€˜superior military technologyâ€™). But it also took a strategic eye, and the guile and persuasion required to form alliances with hundred of other tribes, rulers and traders. He did this through his wives, who numbered more than 500. He took a wife {{from the village of}} each subordinate chief, making the chief think this gave him an advocate at Msiri's court, but the wife was used to spy on the chief instead and to obtain information about his dealings and loyalty. The <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> also be used as a hostage in case of any rebellion by that chief.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} {{in his chair}} {{in the sitting room}} just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back. He was listening to his favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the Texarkana Gazette when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E
25|$|Pitezel {{agreed to}} fake {{his own death}} so that his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> collect on a $10,000 life {{insurance}} policy, which she was to split with Holmes and Jeptha Howe. The scheme, which was {{to take place in}} Philadelphia, called for Pitezel to set himself up as an inventor under the name B.F. Perry, and then be killed and disfigured in a lab explosion. Holmes was to find an appropriate cadaver {{to play the role of}} Pitezel. Instead, Holmes killed Pitezel by knocking him unconscious with chloroform and setting his body on fire with the use of benzene. In his confession, Holmes implied that Pitezel was still alive after he used the chloroform on him, prior to being set on fire. However, forensic evidence presented at Holmes' later trial showed that chloroform had been administered after Pitezel's death (a fact which the insurance company was unaware of), presumably to fake suicide to exonerate Holmes should he be charged with murder.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{if a man}} is {{poisoned}} {{to death}} by an overdose of arsenic, {{and a bottle of}} arsenic is found in the purse of his <b>wife,</b> that bottle <b>could</b> be considered inculpatory evidence against his wife. The bottle of arsenic in his <b>wife's</b> purse <b>could</b> also be considered exculpatory evidence, tending to show the man's innocence as far as suicide is concerned.|$|R

25|$|Macedonski's {{father had}} by then {{become known as}} an authoritarian commander, and, during his time in TÃ¢rgu Ocna, faced a mutiny which only his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> stop by {{pleading}} with the soldiers (an episode which made an impression on the future poet). A stern parent, he took {{an active part in}} educating his children. Having briefly served as Defense Minister, the general was mysteriously dismissed by Cuza in 1863, and his pension became the topic of a political scandal. It ended only under the rule of Carol I, Cuza's Hohenzollern successor, when Parliament voted against increasing the sum to the level demanded by its recipient. Having preserved a negative impression of the 1866 plebiscite, during which Cuza's dethronement had been confirmed, Macedonski remained a committed opponent of the new ruler. As a youth and adult, he sought to revive his father's cause, and included allusions to the perceived injustice in at least one poem. After spending the last months of his life protesting against the authorities, Macedonski-father fell ill and died in September 1869, leaving his family to speculate that he had been murdered by political rivals.|$|E
500|$|Menefee {{argued that}} the ritual {{mirrored}} that of a livestock saleâ€”the symbolic meaning of the halter; wives were even occasionally valued by weight, just like livestock. Although the halter was considered central to the [...] "legitimacy" [...] of the sale, Thompson has suggested that Menefee may have misunderstood {{the social context of}} the transaction. Markets were favoured not because livestock was traded there, but because they offered a public venue where the separation of husband and <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> be witnessed. Sales often took place at fairs, in front of public houses, or local landmarks such as the obelisk at Preston (1817), or Bolton's [...] "gas pillar" [...] (1835), where crowds could be expected to gather.|$|E
500|$|The {{bodies were}} transported to Trieste by the {{battleship}} [...] {{and then to}} Vienna by special train. [...] Even though most foreign royalty had planned to attend, they were pointedly disinvited and the funeral was just the immediate imperial family, with the dead couple's three children excluded from the few public ceremonies. The officer corps was forbidden to salute the funeral train, and {{this led to a}} minor revolt led by Archduke Karl, the new heir to the throne. The public viewing of the coffins was curtailed severely and even more scandalously, Montenuovo tried unsuccessfully to make the children foot the bill. The Archduke and Duchess were interred at Artstetten Castle because his <b>wife</b> <b>could</b> not be buried at the Imperial Crypt.|$|E
50|$|During the Allied Occupation of Japan (through 1952) U.S. {{officers}} and their <b>wives</b> <b>could</b> take courses in bonsai, bonkei, ikebana, and other traditional {{arts and crafts}} as arranged by General MacArthur's headquarters. Many of the older and limited varieties of trees were no longer available, and the bonsai considered in fashion changed partly because of this shortage. Copper wire now largely replaced ordinary iron wire for shaping the better trees, but the latter still {{would be used for}} mass-produced commercial bonsai.|$|R
