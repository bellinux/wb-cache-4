500|$|Scott's initial {{plan was}} that the dogs would return to base at this stage. However, because of the slower than {{expected}} progress Scott {{decided to take the}} dogs on further. Day and Hooper were dispatched to Cape Evans with a message to this effect for Simpson, who had been left in charge there. On [...] the expedition had reached the Gateway, the name given by Shackleton to the route from the Barrier on to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point a blizzard struck, forcing the men to camp until [...] and to break into rations intended for the Glacier journey. When the blizzard lifted, the remaining ponies were shot as planned, and their meat deposited as food for the return parties. On , Meares and Dimitri turned back with the dogs, carrying a message back to base that [...] "things were not as rosy as they might be, but <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> spirits up and say the luck must turn." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} by FIRE, [...] "Roger Slatt, Director of the School of Geology and Geophysics, began to unconstitutionally monitor Deming's {{letters to the}} newspaper and include them in three professional evaluations, until directed to stop by OU President David L. Boren. A former US Senator, Boren had stated in a 2001 editorial, [...] "a university {{is a place of}} many diverse viewpoints where free speech is encouraged." [...] In June 2003, Boren wrote to Deming, saying, [...] "I fully agree with you that your political views should not be included as a factor in your post-tenure review." [...] In a July 24, 2003 email, Dean Snow complained that [...] "it is doubly frustrating that President Boren...has shown such sympathy for Deming.", and wrote that he would try to convince Deming's department head to [...] " [...] basically ignore and then marginalize Deming.… As long as <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> i’s dotted and our t’s crossed, all Deming can really do is make noise and cause a bit more paperwork.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the sailors}} hailed them roughly from the quay, ‘What men are you?—we want no strangers here, nor pirates. <b>We</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> {{business}} to ourselves.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|We will cheer {{our team}} to victory, <b>We</b> will <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> spirits high! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes open," [...] {{answered}} George Strong; {{and then}} the conversation changed to the lessons for the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, let us tell Dick, though, {{and a few}} of the others. Then <b>we</b> can <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes peeled for Lew Flapp and, if he {{actually}} does wrong, expose him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am an adventurer, not a patriot, and {{my partner}} {{is out for}} money, but we made a bargain with Don Martin and <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How so, Mr. M'Carthy?" [...] said Somers. [...] "But shan't we be all more {{comfortable}} if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> chairs? There'll be less ceremony, won't there, Mr. Townsend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miriam," [...] {{interposed}} Donatello with gentle gravity, [...] "why should <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> {{friend in}} suspense? We know what anxiety he feels. Let us give him what intelligence we can." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the video}} progresses, {{a young man}} {{continues}} the song: [...] "Children, <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> religious commandments. There is no god but Allah, and Allah loves shaheeds" [...] (Islamic martyrs).|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It {{does not}} become us, perhaps,’ pursued the Dean, ‘to be partisans. Not partisans. <b>We</b> clergy <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> hearts warm and our heads cool, and we hold a judicious middle course.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jill, [...] "I'll go {{back and}} tell them that you will not do what we ask. <b>We</b> will <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> make-up on in case you change your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, after all, {{will not}} the text tell us best {{how to keep}} Passion Week? Will not our Lord's own example tell us? Can we go wrong, if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> Passion Week as Christ kept his? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. But if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> {{eyes and}} ears open we may learn something. In the morning some of us can call on those brokers {{and see what they}} have to say," [...] {{continued}} the big brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, do you fellows {{know that}} it's {{five minutes to}} twelve?" [...] {{questioned}} Andy, after consulting his watch. [...] "I move that <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes open for some place where we can take it easy and have lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A starlit sky {{in autumn}} can {{scarcely}} be the fittest curtain for one so weak as you, sir; I should recommend travelling on, if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> on <b>our</b> horses' backs till dawn." ...|$|R
5000|$|The company's {{stated goal}} is [...] "to develop {{software}} sustainably while preventing profit rationale from forcing engineering compromises. By doing so, <b>we</b> can <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> product visions intact, giving maximum benefit to our users." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe that}} other party is around here," [...] said John Barrow. [...] "We had better leave {{the man at}} the fire. <b>We</b> can <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes open for the enemy--as you call 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{depends upon}} how long Leeson remains away. I move we remain on guard--one {{at the front}} of the cabin and the other at the rear. If <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes peeled they can't come very close, even though it is dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let {{him have}} it. It's all spoilt now, anyway. But I'll tell you what, Pony--we've got to do {{something}} with that dog. He's found out where <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> provisions, and now he'll always eat them. I don't know but what we'll have to kill him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will think}} of Charley (from whom I have heard here) and soon write to him definitely. At present I think he had better join me at Boulogne. I shall not bring the little boys over, as, if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> time, {{it would be too}} long before Christmas Day.|$|E
6000|$|This induced John Rokesmith to observe--by way {{of making}} the thing more natural--'Bella, my love, this {{is so much more}} {{successful}} than any of our past anniversaries, that I think <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> future anniversaries here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jed Sanborn {{was telling}} me he had seen some wild ducks up here last week," [...] said the doctor's son. [...] "If they are around <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes peeled for them. They are pretty scarce." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘We {{must take}} stimulants,’ said the cunning Wosky—‘plenty of nourishment, and, above all, <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> nerves quiet; <b>we</b> {{positively}} must not {{give way to}} our sensibilities. We must take all we can get,’ concluded the doctor, as he pocketed his fee, ‘and <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> quiet.’ ...|$|R
60|$|The {{parallel}} I {{have just}} drawn only {{goes to show}} that it makes no difference whether the oppression is bitter or not; men with red, warm blood in their veins will not endure it, but will seek to cast it off. If <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> hearts in this matter Russia will be free.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reference}} to her poverty touched him. It was a confidence, coming from one so reticent, that was of value. He {{waited a moment}} and said, [...] "It's surprising how well <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> footing here, isn't it? There's hardly any swell, but the ship pitches. I think we walk better together than alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One word more," [...] she said, [...] "while Selina {{is out of}} the way. I need hardly {{tell you}} that I have not trusted her with the Minister's secret. You and I are, as I take it, the only people now living who know the truth about these two girls. And <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can have}} a fine time there," [...] said Baxter. [...] "And as the Rovers' {{houseboat}} will not be far off, <b>we</b> can <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> eyes on that crowd and watch our chance to deal them another blow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{but then}} we each made four, and fifty cents {{is a good deal}} of money. Are you sorry <b>we</b> didn't <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> {{quarters}} for ourselves?" [...] asked the other voice, with an under-tone of regret in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly think so, Fred. And, anyway, I don't see how he's {{going to}} get in here, with the door closed and the blanket nailed over the window. However, <b>we</b> can <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> guns handy in case he does appear." ...|$|R
60|$|Into His {{presence}} may we {{all come}} at last! But we shall never come thither, unless <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> honour bright, our courage unbroken, and ourselves unspotted from the world. For so only will be fulfilled in us the sixth Beatitude--Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Unto which may God of His free mercy bring us all. Amen.|$|E
60|$|How then {{shall we}} keep off {{coarseness}} of soul? How shall <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> souls REFINED? that is, true and honest, pure, amiable, full of virtue, that is, true manliness; and deserve praise, that is, {{the respect and}} admiration of our fellow-men? By thinking of those very things, says St. Paul. And {{in order to be}} able to think of them, by reading of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{left here}} to-night,' said Solomon Daisy, 'I little thought what {{day of the}} month it was. I have never gone alone into the church after dark on this day, for seven-and-twenty years. I have heard it said that as <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> birthdays when we are alive, so the ghosts of dead people, who are not easy in their graves, keep the day they died upon.--How the wind roars!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I saw," [...] {{said the}} invalid, smiling {{up at his}} chief. [...] "Well, well, we must let them see {{that the country is}} not entirely ruled from Printing House Square yet. <b>We</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> own course without faltering." ...|$|R
6000|$|Weissmann's manner changed. He {{resumed his}} most {{peremptory}} tone. [...] "By no means. We must not relax our vigilant scrutiny of fact one atom's weight, but <b>we</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> minds {{open to new}} messages--no matter how repulsive the source." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is not the}} spirit, Captain Gar'ner, I'm {{sorry to}} say, in which <b>we</b> should <b>keep</b> <b>our</b> day of rest, though it is well that <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> it at all. I'm no stickler for houses and congregations, though they are good enough in their times and seasons; for every man has a {{tabernacle}} in his own heart, if he's disposed to worship." ...|$|R
