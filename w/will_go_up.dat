5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E

60|$|<b>Will</b> then <b>went</b> <b>up</b> on {{deck with}} the others. It seemed strange {{to him to}} enter upon what he had {{hitherto}} regarded {{as a sort of}} sacred ground, and he stood shyly aside while the others fell into their duties of looking after the men and seeing that the work was being done. Presently the first lieutenant came on deck. <b>Will</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to him and touched his hat.|$|R

25|$|The {{price of}} food across Australia <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> The floods will cost {{supermarket}} chains {{tens of millions}} of dollars. Some communities isolated by floodwaters experienced food shortages, and a rise in the cost of fruits and vegetables was reported shortly after. Food supplies to northern Queensland were disrupted requiring groceries to be transported to Townsville by ship.|$|E
25|$|Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges {{very similar}} to a {{dramatic}} soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease {{in which the two}} voice-types sing – a mezzo will concentrate singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to notes like high B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower tessitura.|$|E

500|$|Is it {{reasonable}} for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while {{the producer of}} poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We {{want to tell the}} world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [...] do not support all producers.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{majority}} of the system was built before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be handicapped-accessible. Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA. (Most grade-level stations required little modification to meet ADA standards.) In addition, the MTA identified [...] "key stations", high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated. As of January 2017, there are [...] currently accessible stations; many of them have AutoGate access. Under the current MTA plans, the number of ADA accessible stations <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to 144 by 2020.|$|E
500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support an electrical cable, which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, [...] "Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set." ...|$|E
500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to the town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E
50|$|In September 1907, Lucy <b>Wills</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to Newnham College Cambridge. Newnham was {{the second}} of the Cambridge women’s colleges. Girton had been {{established}} in 1869, Newnham in 1872, mainly because of the pioneering work of Henry Sidgwick, then a Fellow of Trinity. He died in 1890, but his widow Eleanor was Principal of the College when Lucy Wills arrived. Eleanor’s brother Arthur Balfour had been Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905 and sometimes visited the college when Lucy Wills was there.|$|R

500|$|In November 2014, Disney Animation {{commenced}} a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to fix what Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> two stories we want to make this building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). Director Don Hall analogized the studio's relocation to the end of The Empire Strikes Back, where [...] "you know they're going to get back together." [...] The renovation was completed in October 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Positive {{reinforcement}} (reinforcement): This {{occurs when}} a behavior (response) is rewarding or the behavior is followed by another stimulus that is rewarding, increasing the frequency of that behavior.

[...] He added, [...] "This aggressive anti-blight effort will help stabilize neighborhoods that have been struggling for years. As the abandoned properties come down, property values <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> and crime will go down.

2500|$|These five ideas {{turn out}} to be {{discrete}} variables, but the profit rate <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> or down, depending on the choice of measure. Andrew Kliman states in his book The failure of capitalist production that [...] "I believe that there are many different legitimate ways of measuring rates of profit, and that none serves as an all-purpose measure. The most relevant rate of profit to consider always depends upon the particular question being addressed." [...] This pluralist approach provides plenty possibilities for all kinds of different interpretations of all kinds of profit rates, depending on what the question is thought to be, to which a profit rate {{is supposed to be the}} answer.|$|E
2500|$|By November 2004, Livingstone {{directly}} contradicted {{his belief}} that the charge would not be raised, saying: [...] "I have always said that during this term [...] it <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to at least £6." [...] By {{the end of the}} month, Livingstone announced that, in fact, the rise would be to £8 for private vehicles and £7 for commercial traffic. Business groups such as London First said following the announcement that the charges were [...] "totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable". The rise to £8 was announced formally on 1 April 2005, along with discounts for drivers buying month or year-long tickets. On 10 May 2006, in a live TV debate, Livingstone supported a rise in the charge to £10 by 2008.|$|E
