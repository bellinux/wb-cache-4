5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E

Regarding the likelihood of his retirement {{at the end of}} the season, he commented: [...] "I'm 99.9 percent certain of that. I'm going to have one final, intense season, rich in big moments, and then it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> to say enough is enough. We've just left one small possibility open with the [...] president , and that is if we manage to win the Champions League I will carry on playing one more year to try to win the Club World Cup and other trophies.". On 4 August, Buffon was named one of the three finalists for the Goalkeeper of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League season award, along with Manuel Neuer and Jan Oblak. On 15 August, Buffon was also listed as one of the three finalists for the 2017 UEFA Best Player of the Year Award, along with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. On 19 August, Buffon made history by saving the first Serie A penalty awarded via VAR in a 3–0 home win over Cagliari in the club's opening league match of the season. On 24 August, he was named the best goalkeeper of the 2016–17 Champions League season, and placed third in the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, with 109 votes. On 23 October, Buffon won the inaugural 2017 Best FIFA Goalkeeper award, and was named to the FIFPro World XI for the third time in his career; he was also nominated for the 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player Award, finishing in fourth place in the voting.|$|E

2500|$|The next day, {{while giving}} his final leader's report, T.C. [...] "Tommy" [...] Douglas {{launched}} the party establishment's opening salvo against the Waffle and their Quebec resolution. He told the almost 2000 convention attendees that {{he rejected the}} principle that Quebec {{has the right to}} self-determination through unilateral separation from Canada. He further rejected the notion that non-Quebecers could not partake in that province's internal debates and stated that he would [...] "do everything I can to better the conditions of those people in Quebec who have been betrayed by successive governments." [...] He reiterated the intent of the compromise motion by stating that if [...] "the overwhelming majority of the people of Quebec want out of Confederation, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> enough to call in the lawyers."

2500|$|The {{intended}} {{audience is}} not evident. Some believe that Prufrock {{is talking to}} another person or directly to the reader, while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes [...] "The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature", while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the [...] "you and I" [...] refers {{to the relationship between}} the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere {{during the course of the}} poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> for various things before [...] "the taking of a toast and tea", and [...] "time to turn back and descend the stair." [...] This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this [...] "overwhelming question". Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.|$|E
