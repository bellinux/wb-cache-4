5|$|Baird was elected, {{defeating}} Liberal candidate Lee Farnworth {{by about}} 5,000 votes. The Ottawa Citizen endorsed Baird in this campaign, {{and argued that}} his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister. In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Hastert {{criticized the}} Clinton administration's plans {{to conduct the}} 2000 Census using {{sampling}} techniques. Hastert was {{a supporter of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and in 1993 voted to approve the trade pact. He was a gun rights supporter <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E

In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as {{a supporter of the}} party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E

5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71â€“11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko {{was elected}} Deputy to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} parties punish {{politicians}} <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> {{the party line}} in roll-call votes. Using data of German members of parliament over the legislative period 2009 - 2013, we {{take into account that}} the effect of punishment differs along the list of candidates because a candidate is punished more when he loses positions at the threshold of promising list positions. The dataset includes the voting behavior of 257 MPs in 218 roll-call votes. Our results do not show that parties account for the voting behavior by punishing politicians <b>who</b> have <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the party line. Political parties may attract different groups of voters by tolerating politicians <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> according to their own credo. Qualities other than the voting behavior seem to matter to political parties when nominating candidates...|$|R

50|$|The {{budget is}} {{announced}} in the House of Commons by the Minister of Finance, who traditionally wears new shoes while doing so. The Budget is then voted on by the House of Commons. Budgets are a confidence measure, and if the House <b>votes</b> <b>against</b> it the government can fall, as happened to Prime Minister Joe Clark's government in 1980. The governing party strictly enforces party discipline, usually expelling from the party caucus any government Member of Parliament (MP) <b>who</b> <b>votes</b> <b>against</b> the budget. Opposition parties almost always <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the budget. In cases of minority government, the government has normally had to include major concessions {{to one of the}} smaller parties to ensure passage of the budget.|$|R

However, following Argentina's December 2001 default on its debts in which its bonds lost 70% of their value, CACs have become much more common, as they are now seen as potentially warding off more drastic action, but enabling easier coordination of bondholders.|$|R
