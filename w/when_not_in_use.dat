5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an anti-tank mine. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the centre}} {{there is a}} Tiso outdoor shop and a HoneyPot Ceramics studio, {{as well as a}} cafe {{overlooking}} the main arena. The centre has a gym that is available <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> by Scottish National Judo Academy. Other classes are held in the Fitness Studio.|$|E
5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E
50|$|In the West, {{a single}} chalice veil is {{normally}} used. The veil will usually {{be the same}} material and color as the priest's vestments, though {{it may also be}} white. It covers the chalice and paten <b>when</b> <b>not</b> actually <b>in</b> <b>use</b> on the altar.|$|R
25|$|South of the {{platform}} is a small set of goods sidings which currently store the TPOs, mineral wagons and other stock <b>when</b> they are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ordinary toilet {{cleaning}} is done using {{a toilet}} brush. Many designs are available, some including a holder to enclose the brush <b>when</b> it is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E
5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by the third section and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E
50|$|All of the Turnpike's {{original}} {{variable message signs}} were replaced from 2010 to 2015. In addition many new signs will be added as well. The replacement signs, which will feature full graphic color matrix technology, will be more up to date, easier to read, and will feature travel times to major routes <b>when</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hidden headlamps, also {{commonly}} known as pop-up headlamps, hideaway headlights, are a form of automotive lighting and an automotive styling feature that conceals an automobile's headlamps <b>when</b> they are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
40|$|Circuit {{combines}} {{functions of}} dc-to-ac inversion (for driving ac motor in battery-powered vehicle) and ac-to-dc conversion (for charging battery from ac line <b>when</b> vehicle <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use).</b> Automatically adapts to either mode. Design of integrated inverter/charger eliminates need for duplicate components, saves space, reduces weight {{and cost of}} vehicle. Advantages in other applications : load-leveling systems, standby ac power systems, and uninterruptible power supplies...|$|R
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
5|$|Transition metals {{are usually}} present as trace {{elements}} in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state {{by the end of}} the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the king or queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2007 The next {{generation}} workstation will {{appear as a}} desk <b>when</b> it is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> but with simple manipulation, the hidden components of the computer will appear. This project is to integrate multiple components of a computer into a single workstation so that the workstation will function as a desk <b>when</b> computer is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> The computer {{will not be the}} only system installed in the desk but also the monitor, speakers, and printer will be integrated into the desk. The goal of this project is to create a stylish workstation that is easy to set-up and use...|$|R
50|$|The sights are folded {{for more}} {{convenient}} carry and storage, with a ladder-type rear sight. The buttstock is {{fitted with a}} rubber recoil pad, and <b>when</b> it is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> it is telescoped into the frame.|$|R
50|$|A {{batch type}} furnace has {{relatively}} low initial equipment costs, and can heat each part load separately. It can turned on and off at will, which reduces operating expenses <b>when</b> it's <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> These furnaces are suited to medium to large volume production, and offer a large degree of flexibility in type of parts that can be brazed. Either controlled atmospheres or flux {{can be used to}} control oxidation and cleanliness of parts.|$|R
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
50|$|IPA Braille {{does not}} use the {{conventions}} of English Braille. It is set off by slash or square brackets, which indicate that the intervening material is IPA rather than national orthography. Thus brackets are required <b>in</b> braille even <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> print.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of port triggering, the router is {{configured}} so that when an outbound connection is attempted on any port from 6660 to 7000, it should allow inbound connections to that particular computer. This gives it more flexibility than static port forwarding {{because it is not}} necessary to set it up for a specific address on your network. Security is also gained, in the sense that the inbound port is <b>not</b> left open <b>when</b> <b>not</b> actively <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many otoscopes <b>used</b> <b>in</b> doctors {{offices are}} {{wall-mounted}} {{while others are}} portable. Wall-mounted otoscopes are attached by a flexible power cord to a base, which serves to hold the otoscope <b>when</b> it's <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> and {{also serves as a}} source of electric power, being plugged into an electric outlet. Portable models are powered by batteries in the handle; these batteries are usually rechargeable and can be recharged from a base unit. Otoscopes are often sold with ophthalmoscopes as a diagnostic set.|$|R

25|$|Until 2011, <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> the Schooner {{was housed}} at the Bartlett Ranch outside Sapulpa, Oklahoma, along with Boomer and Sooner.|$|E
25|$|When {{the desired}} amount of fuel has been transferred, the two {{aircraft}} disconnect and the receiver aircraft departs the formation. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> the boom is stored {{flush with the}} bottom of the tanker's fuselage to minimize drag.|$|E
30|$|Lighting {{is usually}} {{controlled}} by movement sensors that turn off light <b>when</b> rooms are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> (Guo et al. 2010). Almost everywhere on campus needs to manually turn on light. The light level in newer buildings is controlled and regulated automatically based on indoor light sensors.|$|R
50|$|Openings on the {{customer}} side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms <b>when</b> they are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.|$|R
50|$|During royal {{ownership}} Bloodhound would accompany The Royal Yacht Britannia in the Western Isles {{when the}} royal family had their one true family holiday every year. She had a permanent crew of three and one Skipper was a descendent of Sir Francis Drake. It was during these times that the young royals learned to sail on Bloodhound. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> royal <b>use,</b> Bloodhound and her crew were made available to yacht clubs across the country, used to teach thousands of young people how to sail.|$|R
25|$|During {{the declining}} years, freight boats were {{generally}} made in Cumberland. Freight boats {{in those years}} had two hulls, with 4 inches between them. There were holes (covered, <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use)</b> that one could put a pump in to pump out the bilge.|$|E
25|$|Near Infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is {{incorporated}} {{to minimize the}} infrared silhouette. Permanent IR IFF squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when night vision devices are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in garrison or <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom was {{predominantly white}} plastic, with dark red trim. It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, grooves {{on both sides}} of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> and a 15-pin expansion port located on the unit's front panel for accessories.|$|E
2500|$|Stallions {{sometimes}} {{exhibit the}} Flehmen response by smelling the urine of a mare in heat.

50|$|The {{airport is}} {{somewhat}} unusual in {{that due to}} limited space on the island, the runway {{is used as a}} common area for sporting and social activities <b>when</b> it is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> Sirens sound <b>when</b> a plane is about to land, warning residents to stay off the runway.|$|R
5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> military <b>use.</b>|$|R
