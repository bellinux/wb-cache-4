25|$|The CAGE {{questionnaire}} {{was developed in}} 1968 at North Carolina Memorial Hospital to combat the paucity of screening measures to detect problem drinking behaviors. The original study, conducted in a general hospital population where 130 patients <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> to partake in an in-depth interview, successfully isolated four questions {{that make up the}} questionnaire today due to their ability to detect the sixteen alcoholics {{from the rest of the}} patients.|$|E

People <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> into either a mindfulness training group or {{a control group}} that was put {{on a waiting list}} for training. Davidson showed that even eight weekly sessions of meditation enhanced left frontal EEG functioning. Similar study was later replicated by Professor Holzel.|$|E
25|$|A {{research}} {{regarding the}} comparison of Y chromosomes of Indian Muslims with other Indian groups was published in 2005. In this study 124 Sunnis and 154 Shias of Uttar Pradesh <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> for their genetic evaluation. Other than Muslims, Hindu higher and middle caste group members were also selected for the genetic analysis. Out of 1021 samples in this study, only 17 samples showed E haplogroup {{and all of them}} were Shias. The very minor increased frequency however, does place these Shias, solely with regards to their haplogroups, closer to Iraqis, Turks and Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|In late December 2003, {{the names}} of 85,000 conscripts for the first National Service program was made public.

Conscripts are 18 {{years of age and}} picked from a national database that includes all citizens registered with a Malaysian ID card, whether born locally or overseas. Conscripts were informed of their participation in the program by mail at the address listed on their identification card. They are also able to check their status on the program's website, or by SMS. Lists of conscripts names and ID numbers are also published in major newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|Strong self-sampling {{assumption}} (SSSA) (Bostrom): [...] "Each observer-moment should {{reason as}} if it <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> from the class of all observer-moments in its reference class." [...] Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of [...] "observer-moments" [...] helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is {{the selection of the}} appropriate [...] "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.|$|E
2500|$|The 2007 World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) draft, {{the fifth}} WWE draft, {{took place at}} the Wachovia Arena in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on June 11. The first half of the draft was {{televised}} live for three hours on World Wrestling Entertainment's flagship program, Raw on USA Network. [...] The second half of the draft, or the [...] "supplemental draft", was conducted over WWE's website, WWE.com, for four hours on June 17, 2007 as draft picks were announced at twenty-minute intervals. There were twenty-three draft picks, with twenty-seven wrestlers drafted overall, between the promotion's three brands: Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW. For the televised half of the draft, each brand's draft pick was determined by nine matches, one being a battle royal for two draft picks, where wrestlers from their respective brands wrestled to earn a draft pick. The supplemental draft, however, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Raw and SmackDown! received five random draft picks, while ECW received three random draft picks. The televised draft picks <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> by a computer that was shown on the Raw titantron. Every WWE wrestler from Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW was eligible to be drafted.|$|E
