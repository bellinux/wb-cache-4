40|$|Four kitchens, {{each with}} a {{different}} work load, were {{used to evaluate the}} microbiological risk of utilizing blasting granules in a new type of <b>warewash</b> machine. The granules, plastic pellets 3. 5 - 3. 5 mm, are recirculated together with the dishwater in the machine, and when the dishwater is expelled, the granules remain in the machine until the next day. Samples of soiled dishwater and tap water were collected on four occasions during a six-month period. In terms of CFU/ml, the APC in solutions of soiled dishwater was 2. 6 ± 0. 8 log, which is lower than that found in manual dishwashing (4. 0 ± 1. 6 log). The CFU/ml of Bacillus cereus was 2. 8 ± 1. 2 log and of Enterobacteriaceae was 0. 2 ± 0. 4 log. The microbiological levels found are representative of normal working conditions for <b>warewash</b> machines. These levels were compared to results obtained in model experiments, in which granules were kept, moist but drained, for 16 hours and 40 hours, comparable to standstill periods overnight or longer. On the granules in contact with dishwater for 24 or 48 hours, the APC was not increased and the level of B. cereus was decreased. There was a slight {{increase in the number of}} Enterobacteriaceae, but the model experiments did not indicate any increased microbiological risk due to the use of the granules in <b>warewash</b> machines. Outside the machine, cross-contamination of the faucet was indicated by the numbers of microorganisms in tap water samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{professional}} <b>warewashing</b> machines, as {{for example}} the model of Electrolux Rack Type, the working conditions of the pump {{are affected by the}} operating fluid properties, which are different from those of pure water. In fact, the actual trend in this kind of professional appliances is to reduce both energy consumption and time needed for cleaning process: this involves short washing cycles conducted at low temperatures with a solution of water and highly concentrated chemistry. Detergents contain different components and additives, as polymers and surfactants, which can affect the performance of the pump, including cavitation inception conditions. Cavitation leads to flow instabilities, affecting pump performances and inducing an increment in the level of vibrations and noise. While cavitation phenomena in Newtonian fluids is well known, particularly as far as pure water is concerned, in literature there are also various studies on cavitating flows in presence of diluted solutions of polymers additives in water, but only few studies are available regarding the effect of detergent components on pumps cavitation and, in general, on pumps performances. The wide range of variables affecting the phenomenon has {{led to the development of}} a laboratory rig for testing centrifugal pumps with aqueous solutions representative of those used in the <b>warewashing</b> sector [1]. This paper presents the results of tests performed with various solutions of a polymer (Polyox WSR 301) in water. A rheometric analysis has been previously performed on samples of some of the tested solutions, for characterizing their behavior in terms of both viscosity in laminar conditions and their classification as “diluted” or “concentrated”. For each solution, the resulting performance curves of the pump are then compared with those obtained with pure water...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a highly original carbon-energy calculator, designed {{with the aim}} of realistically and holistically evaluating the carbon and energy impacts of different food preparation options in delivering a restaurant menu. Its design (based on life-cycle principles) brings the customer demand (number, type and timings of meals served) during typical, peak and special weeks together with the food storage, <b>warewashing,</b> ventilation, cooking and hot holding appliance capacities, carbon emissions and energy usage in various states. An assessment of separate and specific behavioural, equipment maintenance, preparation and cooking strategies are performed. The baseline energy use results were validated to within 0. 65 % of the findings from an extensive and detailed monitoring study of a leading operator of UK public houses and restaurants [1]. Seven energy reduction scenarios were then assessed using the developed calculator. Potential energy savings of 58 % (195 MWh) and emissions savings of 46 % (55, 224 kgCO 2 e) per year were indicated from replacing the chargrill, fryers and microwave combi ovens with two combi steam ovens and reducing freezing demand in the case study restaurant. This scenario projects reductions in energy use of 37. 77 million kWh (£ 2 million) per year for the whole restaurant chain and up to 346 million kWh (£ 18. 3 million) if applied to the whole case study organisation...|$|E
40|$|Cavitation is a {{phenomenon}} characterised {{by the presence of}} vapour bubbles in the fluid led by a local drop in pressure. In literature it is well known the impact on cavitation of pressure and temperature of pure water, but there are only few studies analysing how the presence of certain components of detergents and additives can influence the phenomenon. The impact of detergents and additives could be explained by the modified viscosity and rheology of the solution but also by the variation in the vapour tension. Most of these effects are due to the presence of surfactants and polymers in the solution. Cavitation in dynamic pumps is an important aspect that needs to be monitored and prevented, because it can cause damages affecting pump performances and inducing an increment in the level of vibration and noise. In professional <b>warewashing</b> machines, as for example the models of Electrolux Rack Type, this phenomenon can affect the operating functionalities of the machine. An experimental pump test rig has been realized with the aim of studying and monitoring the influence of these parameters on cavitation inception. This test rig permits measuring the pump performances at various operating conditions, in order to obtain its characteristic curves, and also forcing cavitation to measure its Net Positive Suction Head required (NPSHr) at different flow rates. The pump test rig allows also testing various configurations of the pump at different cavitation conditions, obtained by changing not only the suction pressure and temperature of the fluid but also its properties, adding detergents and additives. Cavitation inception can be detected measuring both the corresponding prevalence decrease and the change of vibration and noise level...|$|E

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established the Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) in the 1970 s as a cooperative activity with the cruise ship industry. The program assists the cruise ship industry in fulfilling its responsibility for developing and implementing comprehensive sanitation programs to minimize the risk for acute gastroenteritis. Every vessel that has a foreign itinerary and carries 13 or more passengers is subject to twice-yearly inspections and, when necessary, reinspection. VSP operated continuously at all major U. S. ports from the early 1970 s through 1986, when CDC terminated portions of the program. Industry and public pressures resulted in Congress directing CDC through specific language included in CDC appropriations to resume the program. CDC 2 ̆ 019 s National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) became responsible for VSP in 1986. NCEH held a series of public meetings to determine the needs and desires of the public and cruise ship industry and on March 1, 1987, a restructured program began. In 1988, the program was further modified by introducing user fees to reimburse the U. S. government for costs. A fee based on the vessel 2 ̆ 019 s size is charged for inspections and reinspections. A VSP Operations Manual based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1976 model code for food service and the World Health Organization 2 ̆ 019 s Guide to Ship Sanitation was published in 1989 {{to assist the}} cruise ship industry in educating shipboard personnel. In 1998, it became apparent that is was time to update the 1989 version of the VSP Operations Manual. Changes in the FDA Food Code, new science on food safety and protection, and newer technology in the cruise ship industry contributed to the need for a revised operations manual. Over the next 2 years, VSP solicited comments from and conducted public meetings with representatives of the cruise industry, general public, FDA, and international public health community to ensure that the 2000 manual would appropriately address current public health issues related to cruise ship sanitation. A similar process was followed to update the VSP 2000 Operations Manual in 2005. Although the VSP 2005 Operations Manual was in use for almost 6 years, new technology, advanced food science, and emerging pathogens require updates to the manual. The VSP 2011 Operations Manual reflects comments and corrections submitted by cooperative partners in government and private industry as well as the public. We would like to thank all those who submitted comments and participated throughout this process. As new information, technology, and input are received, we will continue to review and record that information and maintain a public process to keep the VSP Operations Manual current. The VSP 2011 Operations Manual continues the 40 +-year tradition of government and industry working together to achieve a successful and cooperative Vessel Sanitation Program that benefits millions of travelers each year.

40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{established}} the Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) in 1975 as a cooperative endeavor with the cruise vessel industry. VSP' {{goal is to}} assist the industry {{to develop and implement}} comprehensive sanitation programs to protect the health of passengers and crew aboard cruise vessels. Every cruise vessel that has a foreign itinerary, carries 13 or more passengers, and calls on a U. S. port is subject to biannual operational inspections and when necessary, re-inspection by VSP. The vessel owner pays a fee, based on gross registered tonnage (GRT) of the vessel, for all operational inspections. The Vessel Sanitation Program Operations Manual (VSP Operations Manual), which is available on the VSP Web site (www. cdc. gov/nceh/vsp), covers details of these inspections. Additionally, cruise vessel owners or shipyards that build or renovate cruise vessels may voluntarily request plan reviews, on-site shipyard construction inspections and/or final construction inspections of new or remodeled vessels before their first or next operational inspection. The vessel owner or shipyard pays a fee, based on GRT of the vessel, for on-site and final construction inspections. VSP does not charge a fee for plan reviews or consultations. Section 3. 0, Procedures for Making Requests for Plan Reviews and Construction-Related Inspections covers details pertaining to plan reviews, consultations, or construction inspections. The Recommended Shipbuilding Construction Guidelines for Cruise Vessels Destined to Call on U. S. Ports, has been renamed as the Vessel Sanitation Program Construction Manual (referred to in this documents as "these guidelines". The main purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework of consistent construction and design guidelines that protect passenger and crew health. CDC is committed to promoting high construction standards to protect the public's health. Compliance with these guidelines will help to ensure a healthy environment on cruise vessels. CDC reviewed many references {{from a variety of sources}} to develop this document. These references are indicated in Section 32. 2, Standards, Codes and Other References Reviewed for Guidance. These guidelines cover various components of the vessel's facilities related to public health, including food storage, preparation, and service; water bunkering, storage, disinfection, and distribution. Vessel owners and operators may select the design and equipment that best meets their needs. However, the design and equipment must also meet the sanitary design criteria of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or equivalent organization, and VSP'sroutine operational inspection requirements. These guidelines are not meant to limit the introduction of new designs, materials or technology for shipbuilding. A shipbuilder, owner, manufacturer, or other interested party may request VSP to periodically review or revise these guidelines in relation to new information or technology. VSP reviews such requests in accordance with the criteria described in Section 2. 0, "Revisions and Recommended Changes. " New cruise vessels must comply with all international code requirements (e. g., International Maritime Organization [IMO] Conventions). Those include requirements of the Safety of Life-at-Sea Convention (SOLAS), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), Tonnage and Load Line Convention, International Electrical Code (IEC), International Plumbing Code (IPC), and International Standards Organization (ISO). This document does not cross-reference related and sometimes overlapping standards that new cruise vessels must meet. These guidelines went into effect on June 1, 2005. They apply to vessels that lay keel or perform any major renovation (e. g., any changes to the structural elements of the vessel covered by these guidelines) after this date. The guidelines do not apply to minor renovations such as the installation or removal of single pieces of equipment, (refrigerator units, bains-marie units, etc.) or single pipe runs. These guidelines will apply to all areas of the vessel affected by a renovation.
