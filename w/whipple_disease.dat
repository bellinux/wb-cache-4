40|$|<b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a chronic}} {{multisystemic}} infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei (T. whipplei). Despite the ubiquitous {{presence of the}} pathogen, <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> is very rare. <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients seem to be immunologically predisposed for the infection, since they are for example not able to induce a T. whipple-specific Th 1 response. However it is not known, if antigen presenting cells from <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients are able to induce an adequate T. whipplei-specific T cell reactivity or if deficient recognition of T. whipplei antigens by T cells {{is responsible for the}} reduced antigen-specific T cell reactivity. The pathophysiological hallmark of <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> is the massive accumulation of T. whipplei in macrophages of the lamina propria of the duodenum that tolerate the presence of the pathogen. To elucidate dysfunction of macrophages that might trigger the pathogenesis of <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease,</b> monocytes and macrophages were analysed in situ, ex vivo, and in vitro regarding their phenotype and functionality. Furthermore the influence of T. whipplei and immunogenetic proteins of T. whipplei on macrophage differentiation was defined. For that purpose, blood, serum, and duodenal specimens from <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and healthy controls were analysed using immunhistochemical and immunological methods. In duodenal biopsies from <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients phenotypically and functionally alterna-tively activated macrophages (M 2 macrophages) were detected, which are characterized by an enhanced expression of IL- 10. Thus, these macrophages can induce tolerance and weaken Th 1 polarisation of T-cells and inhibit the development of classically activated macrophages (M 1 macrophages). The enhanced numbers of CD 163 + monocytes and the reduced expression of HLA-DR on peripheral blood monocytes from <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> pa-tients demonstrated that the alternative macrophage activation is not only a local phenom-enon in the duodenum but can also be detected systemically. Functionally this manifested in the absence of specific T cell reactivity and altered production on immunoglobulins in <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients. T. whipplei hsp 70 was defined as an immunogenic protein but was not able to influence macrophage differentiation. Furthermore it was shown in this work that monocytes from <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients exhibited a reduced production of IL- 1 , IL- 6 and TNF and an enhanced expression of IL- 10 after stimulation with LPS or T. whipplei. In vitro macrophages of <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and healthy controls differentiated similarly and were able to induce antigen-specific T cell reactions. A regulatory cytokine milieu in the serum and the duodenum seems to inhibit the inflammatory activation of macrophages. Obviously, in <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> a regulatory cytokine milieu results in deficient antigen presenting cells that participate in the reduced immune activation of Th 1 cells. M 2 macrophages, which favour a Th 2 response, have a reduced capacity to digest affiliated material. An efficient antigen presentation cannot occur without the proper processing of the bacterial components into single peptides. Therefore, the M 2 macrophage polarisation in <b>Whipple’s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and the weak induction of an efficient immune response favour the persistence of T. whipplei...|$|R

We analysed 39 samples from 39 patients with <b>Whipple's</b> <b>disease</b> and 10 samples from 10 asymptomatic carriers. Twenty-six classic gastrointestinal <b>Whipple's</b> <b>disease</b> associated with additional manifestations, six relapses of classic <b>Whipple's</b> <b>disease</b> (three gastrointestinal and three neurological relapses), and seven isolated infections due to T. whipplei without digestive involvement (five endocarditis, one spondylodiscitis and one neurological infection) were included in the study.

No significant correlation between HVGS genotypes and clinical manifestations of <b>Whipple's</b> <b>disease,</b> or asymptomatic carriers, was found for the 49 samples tested.

Apatient experienced clinical failure during treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The gene encoding the enzyme putatively believed to be dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), the target of sulfamethoxazole, was amplified and sequenced for 20 T. whipplei strains from our laboratory and for isolates recovered from a case patient {{at the time of}} diagnosis and the time of treatment failure.

The target gene was identified among genes encoding a unique trifunctional enzyme in which DHPS is combined with the 2 preceding enzymes of the folate biosynthesis pathway. Changes in the amino acid sequence of putative DHPS were detected in the case patient. Gene complementation showed that the gene encoding putative DHPS restored the folate biosynthesis pathway and susceptibility to sulfamethoxazole, whereas themutated sequence was associated with sulfamethoxazole resistance.
