40|$|Helping Verbs, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 4 Helping Verbs – 5 Grammatical Functions The purpose of this lesson is to list {{the ways in which}} Helping Verbs are used in English tenses. English is not a heavily inflected language. Instead, it makes use of Helping Verbs. Helping Verbs are verbs that have grammatical functions in subject-verb combinations without adding semantic meanings to the sentences in which they are found. Chart # 1 presents the helping verbs used in the 12 English tenses. Chart # 1 – English Helping Verbs Simple Tenses Continuing Tenses Before Tenses Continuing Before Tenses Future Tenses will will be will have will have been Present Tenses do does am is are have has have been has been Past Tenses did was were had had been In spoken English, Helping Verbs are frequently reduced and contracted with other words, but they have 5 very important Grammatical Functions. 1. Helping Verbs indicate the Kind of Tense used in an utterance. Continuing Tenses use the verb ‘BE’ as helping verbs. Before tenses use the verb ‘HAVE”. Simple tenses use the verb ‘DO’ in negatives and questions. 2. Helping Verbs indicate the Time – Past, Present or Future – when the events described by the verb took place. 3. English Negative utterances are formed by placing the word ‘NOT’ after the initial Helping Verb as illustrated in Chart # 2. Frequently the Helping Verb and ‘NOT’ are contracted. This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Chart # 2 Using Helping Verbs in Negative Sentences Simple Tenses Continuing Tenses Before Tenses Continuing Before Tenses Future Tenses I will not walk home. I will not be walking home. I will not have walked home. I will not have been walking home. Present Tenses I do not walk home. I am not walking home. I have not walked home. I have not been walking home. Past Tenses I did not walk home. I was not walking home. I had not walked home. I had not been walking home. 4. English Questions are formed by inverting subject-verb word order. In nearly all cases, it is a Helping Verb that comes before the subject to form a question as illustrated in Chart # 3.
