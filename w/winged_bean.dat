50|$|Because {{the early}} growth of <b>winged</b> <b>bean</b> is slow, it is {{important}} to maintain weeds. Slow early growth makes <b>winged</b> <b>bean</b> susceptible to weed competition in the first 4-6 weeks of development.

40|$|Microstructures {{of seven}} plant {{introductions}} of <b>winged</b> <b>beans</b> (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) produced in Okinawa, Japan were investigated. In cotyledonary cells of <b>winged</b> <b>beans,</b> protein bodies plus numerous lipid bodies were distributed in a cytoplasmic network. Starch granules were {{often found in}} some introductions but rarely in others. All seven introductions had very thick cell walls. The high protein, fat and hemicellulose contents of <b>winged</b> <b>beans</b> {{are consistent with the}} numerous protein bodies, lipid bodies and thick cell walls in the mature cotyledonary cells. The cell walls contained a number of depressions or cavities 1 to 2 lJ m deep which frequently occurred opposite complementary pits in adjacent cells (presumably pit-pairs). Plasmodesmata traverse the cell walls in the pit-pairs. In order to determine changes during development, cultivar UPS- 32 cultivated at Fukuoka-city was used. In coty ledonary cells at 30 days after flowering, cell walls which had pitpairs with plasmodesmata, developing amyloplasts with starch granules, vacuoles with dense flocculent materials, tubular rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria etc., were observed but no protein bodies or lipid bodies were apparent. Protein bodies and lipid bodies were, however, found at 45 days after flowering. Cotyledonary cells at 45 days contained many starch granules but mature seeds contained few, if any...|$|R

50|$|<b>Winged</b> <b>bean</b> {{can grow}} {{at least as}} fast as {{comparable}} legumes, including soy.16 Plants flower 40 to 140 days after sowing. Pods reach full-length about two weeks after pollination. Three weeks after pollination, the pod becomes fibrous; after six weeks, mature seeds are ready for harvest. Tuber development and flower production vary according to genotype and environmental factors. Some <b>winged</b> <b>bean</b> varieties do not produce tuberous roots. The <b>winged</b> <b>bean</b> is a tropical plant, and will only flower when the day length is shorter than 12 hours, although some varieties {{have been reported to}} be day-length neutral.

Raw vegetables often accompany a meal to help cool the tongue. The most popular meat is freshwater fish, which is also used to make two flavourings, fish sauce ( [...] , [...] Nampla) and padaek ( [...] , [...] Pla ra). Other common meats include pork, chicken, duck, beef, eggs, water buffalo. Protein intake includes a wide range of delicacies, including lizards, insects, frogs, and wild deer that also come from the forests.

Root crops and some beans like camote, patani, kadios are also optionally added. The young pod of marunggay is also added. It is usually spiced with ginger, onions, or garlic. A Tagalog version usually includes calabaza (kalabasa). Most of these vegetables are easily accessible and are grown in backyards and gardens of most Ilocano households. As its name suggests, it is usually cooked until almost dry and shriveled; in Tagalog version, the flavors of the vegetables are accentuated with shrimp paste. In some cases, lechon, chicharon, or other meats (most commonly pork) are added.|$|R

40|$|Forty-nine fast-growing Rhizobium strains {{from the}} nodules of 26 {{different}} tropical legume genera were screened to find isolates that would (i) nodulate, e. g., <b>winged</b> <b>beans,</b> so producing large nodules for RNA and protein isolation; (ii) also nodulate various small-seeded legumes, thus allowing screening {{of large numbers}} of mutants; and (iii) harbor plasmids containing nif structural genes as well as other functions involved in nodulation. On the basis of six different criteria, this rhizobial group appeared intermediate between classical fast- and slow-growing organisms, yet all contained plasmids. Plasmid numbers varied from one to five. Hybridizations between DNA prepared from nifDH and the putatative “nod” region of R. meliloti and these plasmids bound to nitrocellulose filters suggested that nif-nod genes are linked on a single sym plasmid. A broad-host-range strain containing a single sym plasmid was chosen for further study. Its plasmid, pMPIK 3030 a, was isolated on cesium chloride gradients and cloned in the cosmid pJB 8, and the overlapping fragments were mapped by homology with the nif and nod regions of R. meliloti. As the wild-type plasmid pMPIK 3030 a was not self-transmissible, confirmation that the nod genes detected by homology were responsible for nodulation was obtained by introducing the mobilization functions of RP 4 (together with Tn 5) and selecting transconjugants resistant to kanamycin and neomycin. Transconjugants (obtained at a frequency of about 10 - 6 per recipient) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens cured of the Ti plasmid produced ineffective nodules on Vigna unguiculata, those in nonnodulating (Nod-) R. meliloti were partially effective, while those in Nod-R. leguminosarum were often fully effective...|$|R
