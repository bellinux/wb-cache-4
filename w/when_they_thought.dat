5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} printing {{was made}} before English spelling was standardized, and when printers, {{as a matter}} of course, expanded and contracted the spelling of the same words in different places, so as to achieve an even column of text. They set v for initial u and v, and u for u and v everywhere else. They used long ſ for non-final s. The glyph j occurs only after i, as in the final letter in a Roman numeral. Punctuation was relatively heavy, and differed from current practice. When space needed to be saved, the printers sometimes used ye for the, (replacing the Middle English thorn with the continental y), set ã for an or am (in the style of scribe's shorthand), and set & for and. On the contrary, on a few occasions, they appear to have inserted these words <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> a line needed to be padded. Later printings regularized these spellings; the punctuation has also been standardized, but still varies from current usage norms.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> they had found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought it absolutely crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E

His {{daughter}} Rivka died of croup; Sonya died of an infection contracted while giving birth to their son Abram; meanwhile, he had been carrying on {{an affair with a}} young woman, Jenny ("Jennya") Kaiser, who was also pregnant, with his son Charles. Depressed after Sonya's death, he passed up an offer to relocate to the United States, which was taken up instead by Mogulesko and Finkel. In winter 1887, an audience at the Princes Street Club panicked <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> a simulated stage fire was real; 17 people died in the stampede. While the authorities determined that this was not Adler's fault, and the club was allowed to reopen, the crowds did not return; [...] "the theater," [...] he writes, [...] "was so cold, dark, and empty you could hunt wolves in the gallery." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of Ultramega OK the band signed with A Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its {{traditional}} audience. Thayil said, [...] "In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> we sold out the punk tenets, getting on a major label and touring with Guns N' Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture." [...] The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused {{a shift in the}} band's songwriting process, according to Cornell: [...] "At the time Hiro [...] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] On September 5, 1989, the band released its second album, Louder Than Love, which saw it take [...] "a step toward the metal mainstream," [...] according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, describing it as [...] "a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing". Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Big Dumb Sex", the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release. Louder Than Love became the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.|$|E

500|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum {{was first}} {{announced}} in August 2008; {{it was developed}} by British studio Rocksteady Studios {{under the aegis of}} Eidos Interactive and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Eidos obtained the rights to make a Batman game in spring 2007, and approached then little-known Rocksteady after viewing the developer's prototype. At Eidos' request, Rocksteady presented their approach to the Batman license, and by May 2007, they had begun developing the game's concept, with full production beginning in September. Writer Paul Dini ( [...] , Detective Comics) was first approached by DC Comics around late 2007 about the prospect of creating a story for an original Batman video game. Dini found the idea intriguing, believing that few Batman games were based on an original idea, instead being adapted from film or television. DC Comics asked Dini what his approach to writing a new Batman film or graphic novel would be, but one that was designed for gameplay. He later met with the Rocksteady team, where it was decided that Dini's ideas were in line with what Rocksteady wanted to achieve. By the time Dini joined the project, Rocksteady were investigating the idea of setting the game within Arkham, and had produced preliminary designs depicting it as a huge estate on an island connected to mainland Gotham City by a bridge. The cast had not been finalized, but given the setting it was certain that the Joker would play a large role. The game and story were developed together, with the limitations of mechanics requiring the story to be built around them. The core aim was to make the game engaging enough for players to spend 8–10 hours completing it, especially those uninterested in Batman-franchised media. Rocksteady would guide Dini <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he was writing too much story or character motivation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{participant}} was asked {{at the end}} of those [...] "decide trials" [...] in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.|$|E
