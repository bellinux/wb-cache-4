50|$|The R100 was a {{prototype}} for passenger-carrying airships {{that would serve}} the needs of Britain's empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 was a success in that it made a successful 1930 return trip to and from Canada and while in Canada undertook local trips to Ottawa, Toronto and Niagara Falls from Montreal. But the fatal 1930 crash in France of its government-developed counterpart R101 while flying to India ended British interest in dirigibles. The Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson, was killed in the crash along with many senior figures in the airship development programme. The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped. Shute gives a detailed account of the development of the two airships in his 1954 autobiographical <b>work,</b> <b>Slide</b> Rule. His account is very critical of the R101 design and management team, and strongly hints that senior team members were complicit in concealing flaws in the airship's design and construction. In The Tender Ship, Manhattan Project engineer and Virginia Tech professor Arthur Squires used Shute's account of the R100 and R101 as a primary illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach. There is currently no known conducting any research in the field of slide switching concrete pumps with hydraulic drive. As the results of studies on the effectiveness of the concrete pumps with hydraulic impact design features slide switching. To confirm this hypothesis were analyzed two schemes slide switching: a new constructive solution of gate devices and the famous S-shaped. If the concrete mix, passing through the gate device on the channel, on the one hand, is in contact with the metal wall and the other side ? with the concrete mixture, the difference should be taken into account conditions of occurrence of shear stresses arising in the concrete layers coming from transport cylinders Concrete pump.

In contrast to the previous <b>works,</b> <b>sliding</b> mode of this controller is free from the influence of disturbance, and the system has both better robustness and quick tracking.

40|$|In this paper, {{non-linear}} estimators and feedforward {{actions are}} designed to solve a vehicular platoon control problem. In particular, these estimators are useful in implementation of a Multi-Layer Consensus Seeking approach to the platooning problem. In the Multi-Layer approach the feed-forward part is built separately from the feedback part, based on desired trajectories. This opens the way to study different methods to compute this information. In this <b>work,</b> <b>sliding</b> mode algorithms are employed to generate the desired trajectories and also to compute the feed-forward control input of each vehicle. In this way, a velocity-dependent inter-vehicle spacing policy can be realized without using derivatives of the vehicular acceleration to compute the feed-forward input. Furthermore, a full-state feedback implementation scheme is discussed. The vehicles are modeled with heterogeneous linear longitudinal dynamics. The proposed algorithms are validated through experiments on automated cars...|$|R
