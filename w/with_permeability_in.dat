None of the tube-wave models presented in the literature predicts attenuation at fracture apertures as small as those producing attenuation in the field; and most models predict tube-wave reflections, which are rarely measured at frequencies greater then 5 kHz. Even the unrealistic assumption {{that all of the}} tube-wave energy loss is caused by viscous dissipation in fracture openings does not result in predicted apertures being as small as those indicated by packer permeability measurements in most situations. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that plane-fracture models cannot account for the measured tube-wave attenuation where natural fractures intersect fluidfilled boreholes. However, natural fractures are fundamentally different from plane parallel passages. This difference appears to explain the small equivalent flow apertures and lack of reflections associated with fractures in waveform-log data. Permeable fracture openings modeled as irregular tubes embedded between asperities along the fracture face are predicted to produce significant tube-wave attenuation when tube diameters exceed 1. 0 cm, but arrays of such tubes conduct fluid flow equivalent to that through plane fractures less than 2 mm in effective flow aperture. Although the theory predicts some reflection from simple cylindrical passages, scattering from irregular distributions of natural fracture openings probably accounts for the infrequency with which coherent tube-wave reflections occur in field data.

40|$|International audienceThe {{classical}} {{formulation of}} the coupled hydroelectrical flow in porous media {{is based on a}} linear formulation of two coupled constitutive equations for the electrical current density and the seepage velocity of the water phase and obeying Onsager's reciprocity. This formulation shows that the streaming current density is controlled by the gradient of the fluid pressure of the water phase and a streaming current coupling coefficient that depends on the so-called zeta potential. Recently a new formulation has been introduced in which the streaming current density is directly connected to the seepage velocity of the water phase and to the excess of electrical charge per unit pore volume in the porous material. The advantages of this formulation are numerous. First this new formulation is more intuitive {{not only in terms of}} constitutive equation for the generalized Ohm's law but also in specifying boundary conditions for the influence of the flow field upon the streaming potential. With the new formulation, the streaming potential coupling coefficient shows a decrease of its magnitude <b>with</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>in</b> agreement with published results. The new formulation is also easily extendable to non-viscous laminar flow problems (high Reynolds number ground water flow in cracks for example) and to unsaturated conditions with applications to the vadose zone. We demonstrate here that this formulation is suitable to model self-potential signals in the field. We investigate infiltration of water from an agricultural ditch, vertical infiltration of water into a sinkhole, and preferential horizontal flow of ground water in a paleochannel. For the three cases reported in the present study, a good match is obtained between the finite element simulations performed with the finite element code Comsol Multiphysics 3. 3 and field observations. Finally, this formulation seems also very promising for the inversion of the geometry of ground water flow from the monitoring of self-potential signals...|$|E
