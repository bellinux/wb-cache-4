500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{unconfirmed}} stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once {{offered him a}} seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, [...] "Ten years? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? Rickey got 16, 17 years." [...] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson {{was said to have}} commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, [...] "That was me." [...] The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, {{as well as with the}} 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E

500|$|Since Mrs. Voorhees, {{the killer}} in the {{original}} Friday the 13th, does not show up until the final reel of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini {{was inspired by the}} 1975 film Jaws, where the shark is not seen {{for the majority of the}} film, but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience as to when the shark was present during scenes and unseen. While listening to a piece of Krzysztof Penderecki music, which contained a chorus with [...] "striking pronunciations", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for Friday the 13th. He came up with the sound [...] "ki ki ki, ma ma ma", based on the line [...] "Kill her mommy!", which Mrs. Voorhees recites repeatedly in the final reel. The [...] "ki" [...] comes from [...] "kill", and the [...] "ma" [...] from [...] "mommy". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words [...] "harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone" [...] and ran them into an echo reverberation machine. Manfredini finished the original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend's basement. Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as [...] "iconographic". Manfredini makes note of the mispronunciation of the sounds: [...] "Everybody thinks it's cha, cha, cha. I'm like, 'Cha, cha, cha'? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The next day, the Anti-Defamation League, {{called for}} journalism schools and {{organizations}} to rescind any honors given to Thomas. The organization said that Thomas had [...] "clearly, unequivocally revealed {{herself as a}} vulgar anti-Semite" [...] in the speech. Hours later, Wayne State University in Detroit discontinued the Helen Thomas Spirit of Diversity in Media Award, which it had been granting {{for more than ten}} years, citing what it called her anti-Semitic remarks. Thomas objected, saying that [...] "the leaders of Wayne State University have made a mockery of the First Amendment and disgraced their understanding of its inherent freedom of speech and the press." [...] Asked by the Detroit Free Press how she would respond to people who say she is anti-Semitic, Thomas responded: 'I'd say I'm a Semite. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about?'".|$|E

2500|$|Because the killer, Mrs. Voorhees, appears onscreen {{only during}} the final scenes of the film, Manfredini had the job of {{creating}} a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini borrows from the 1975 film Jaws, where the shark is likewise not seen {{for the majority of}} the film but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience to the shark's invisible menace. Sean S. Cunningham sought a chorus, but the budget would not allow it. While listening to a Krzysztof Penderecki piece of music, which contained a chorus with [...] "striking pronunciations", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound.

2500|$|The Wu Li (吳歷) {{provided}} a different {{account of how}} Taishi Ci came to serve Sun Ce. It mentioned that Taishi Ci was defeated and captured by Sun Ce after their fight at Shen Village. Sun Ce had heard of Taishi Ci before so he released Taishi Ci from his bonds and asked him for advice on his future conquests. Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I am an officer of a defeated army. I am not qualified to speak on such matters." [...] Sun Ce said, [...] "In the past, Han Xin heeded advice from Guangwu. In the present, I seek advice from a man of righteousness. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "My army has recently been defeated. The troops are scattered and low on morale. It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid {{this is not what}} you wish to see." [...] Sun Ce knelt down and said, [...] "What I want is your sincerity. I hope you will return by midday tomorrow." [...] When Sun Ce's subordinates raised doubts about Taishi Ci's loyalty, Sun Ce said, [...] "Taishi Ziyi is a famous man from Qing Province. He is known for keeping his promises. I believe he will not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.|$|E
