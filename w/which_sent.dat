5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} penalty against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play, during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters.

5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention {{saw only}} about a dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} only five states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E
5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|Barbados is the easternmost of {{the islands}} located within the Caribbean Sea. Home to 280,000 residents, Barbados was first settled by the British in the 1620s. The nation {{remained}} a British colony until it declared total independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The first appearance of a uniquely Barbadian delegation at the Olympic games came two years after it declared independence. At its debut, nine male athletes arrived to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Previously, Barbados (as a British colony) constituted {{a major part of}} the West Indies Federation along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> a delegation to participate at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.|$|E

5|$|In the EuroBasket 2007, {{in which}} the top three teams {{automatically}} qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed {{to participate in the}} 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points, and 7.6 rebounds for the tournament. In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days protests intensified, {{moving to the}} Royal Court in Riffa, a royal palace in Safiriyya and finally blocking roads leading to the financial district in Manama. Security forces clashed with protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, but police were overwhelmed by protesters. The government then requested help from neighbor countries, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> about 1,500 security forces to assist the government. A state of emergency was declared and the government launched a crackdown campaign to put down protests by force. The Pearl Roundabout, now cleared of protesters, was torn down by government and protesters found themselves pushed back into their villages. The government arrested over 1,000 protesters including leading opposition and rights activists (known as the Bahrain Thirteen) as well as sportsmen, academics, businessmen, doctors, engineers, journalists and teachers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> a multi-national {{peacekeeping}} force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E

5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed {{to turn around and}} escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Algeciras (also {{known as}} the Battle of the Gut of Gibraltar) was a naval battle fought {{on the night of}} 12 July 1801 (23 messidor an IX of the French Republican Calendar) between a {{squadron}} of British Royal Navy ships of the line and a larger squadron of ships from the Spanish Navy and French Navy in the Gut of Gibraltar. The battle followed closely the First Battle of Algeciras on 6 July, in which a French squadron anchored at the Spanish port of Algeciras was attacked by a larger British squadron based at nearby Gibraltar. In a heavy engagement fought in calm weather in the close confines of Algeciras Bay, the British force had been becalmed and battered, suffering heavy casualties and losing the 74-gun ship HMS Hannibal. Retiring for repairs, both sides called up reinforcements, the French receiving support first, from the Spanish fleet based at Cadiz, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> six ships of the line to escort the French squadron to safety.|$|E
5|$|The auction was {{organised}} by the Ministry of Colonies, <b>which</b> <b>sent</b> five {{officers to}} Senegal for evaluation.

The Faidherbe Bridge Committee and the technical committee in Paris {{agreed that the}} Société de Construction de Levallois-Perret project was the best for the site. On the other hand, {{the president of the}} public works in Senegal and councilman Jean-Jacques Crespin supported the Nouguier, Kessler et Cie project. In the end the contract was awarded to Nouguier, Kessler et Cie at a price of 1.88 million gold francs.|$|E
