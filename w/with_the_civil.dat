5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E
5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E

Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing and rebuilding the city by any means necessary. Working closely with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur's administration also started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents closely cooperating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working closely with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in the war would shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.|$|E
5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced labor of imprisoned black men and women, through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, Sharecropping and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, {{by the age of}} eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war of 69, which brought his family to power.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{expedition}} sailed from Constantinople, Solomon was named {{as one of}} the nine commanders of the foederati regiments. He is not mentioned in Procopius's narrative during the subsequent campaign, but he probably participated in the decisive Battle of Ad Decimum on 13 September 533, which opened the road for the Vandal capital of Carthage. Following the capture of Carthage, Belisarius sent Solomon back to Constantinople to inform Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) of the campaign's progress. Solomon remained in the capital until the spring of 534, when Justinian sent him back to Africa to recall Belisarius and replace him as military commander of the new praetorian prefecture of Africa (magister militum Africae). Belisarius's departure coincided with a general uprising of the Moorish tribes of the interior, before the Byzantines had time to strengthen their hold on the province. As a result, Belisarius left most of his privately raised bucellarii behind, and Emperor Justinian sent additional reinforcements. Soon (sometime in autumn of 534) Emperor Justinian also invested Solomon <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> office of praetorian prefect as well, replacing the aged Archelaus.|$|E
5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success {{in his new}} role, {{learning}} Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan self-governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E
