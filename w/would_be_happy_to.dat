5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> live there indefinitely {{if only she could}} take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
5|$|After filming was completed, {{their public}} {{comments}} {{against each other}} propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within 11 days of its nationwide release, and temporarily revived Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford secretly contacted {{each of the other}} Oscar nominees in the category (Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick, Geraldine Page and Anne Bancroft, all East Coast-based actresses), {{to let them know that}} if they could not attend the ceremony, she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage when the absent Anne Bancroft was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> stay and that any move {{would depend on the}} club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|However, in an {{unexpected}} return, Cissé {{was able to}} come on as a 75th-minute substitute in the second leg of Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool's penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005–06 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez deployed Cissé on the right wing on numerous occasions. While his pace made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> continue in this role rather than in his preferred position as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Cissé also scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool {{went on to win}} 3–1 on penalties. He ended the 05/06 season with 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Carrick {{suffered}} an injury during a pre-season training session that {{was expected to}} keep him out for 12 weeks. Carrick's first game back from injury came at the 1–0 defeat against Manchester City on 2 November 2014, where he came on as a replacement centre-back following Chris Smalling's dismissal. After Marcos Rojo suffered a dislocated shoulder in the same match, Carrick stated that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> play as a makeshift centre-back. After Carrick returned to the starting line-up on a regular basis, Match of the Day 2 pundit Dietmar Hamann attributed some of Manchester United's improved form to Carrick's return in December, after the club had won all of the six games that he had started. Sir Alex Ferguson stated that he thought Carrick was the best English player in an interview with BT Sport in December 2014, shortly after Carrick had been named as Manchester United's new vice-captain by Louis van Gaal. On 15 March 2015, he provided an assist for Marouane Fellaini's goal, and scored his first goal {{in more than a year}} during a 3–0 victory against his former club Tottenham Hotspur. On 20 March 2015, Carrick signed a new one-year extension to his contract, lengthening his Manchester United career to 10 seasons.|$|E

25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they would do everything necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that if that were the case he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E

25|$|In April 1980, King Khalid {{cancelled}} {{the state}} visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of Death of a Princess, that narrated {{the execution of}} Misha'al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz. King Khalid had been invited by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1979, following the Queen's visit to Saudi Arabia in February 1979, during which King Khalid gave her a diamond necklace. The visit that had been cancelled in 1980 was realized on 9 June 1981 for four days. Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have said he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she should talk to Crown Prince Fahd.|$|E
25|$|Their {{presence}} is controversial, and resisted by {{large segments of}} the Christian population, who argue that the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps have tended to be concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese Sunnis, however, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see these Palestinians given the Lebanese nationality, thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of the Sunnis. Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted {{on more than one occasion}} on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.|$|E
25|$|On stage 3 of the Tour de Suisse, Sagan {{showed that}} {{he still has the}} ability to climb with the best in the sport. After making the {{selection}} on the category one climb, Sagan was able to distance himself along with Rui Costa, Roman Kreuziger and Mathias Frank on the final wet and narrow descent. The four held off {{the rest of the field}} and Sagan took the stage victory. Sagan cemented his victory in the points classification by taking the eighth stage, which was flatter and more suited to the sprinters. He got the best of Daniele Bennati and Philippe Gilbert. He then went on to win the Slovak Road Race Championships for the third time, stating that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> harbor the national emblem on his jersey for the Tour de France. At the Tour, Sagan scored numerous second positions before winning stage 7 to Albi, after his team worked to shed the pure sprinters on the Category 2 Col de la Croix de Mounis. He outsprinted the select group he was part of, crossing the line before John Degenkolb. Sagan retained the green jersey to Paris and dyed his beard green to underline that victory. He then went on to win the sprints classification and numerous stages in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge (4 stage wins) and the Tour of Alberta (2 stage wins). Sagan got short of success in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec where he accelerated strongly on one of the final climbs but faded in sight of the finishing line. He compensated two days later by taking victory in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, escaping the leading group on a climb with five kilometers to go and winning solo.|$|E

5000|$|Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, at a {{book signing}} in Belfast {{to promote the}} release of his autobiography, {{expressed}} his sorrow for O'Donoghue. Ahern nominated O'Donoghue for the position of Ceann Comhairle in 2007. He told BBC Radio: John O'Donoghue was an outstanding Minister for Justice, an outstanding Minister for Tourism, Arts and Sport. He did travel abroad. Tourism was an all-island subject {{and he went to}} the cultural events and sporting events and knowing John I think a lot of those events he <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>happier</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going <b>to.</b> He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> down in Kerry. But that's how it goes. ... The issue about expenses abroad, I think I've some sympathy with office holders about that because what happens is when you go abroad embassies and the people you go to organise the hotels and travel and the office holder, the ministers - in this case John O'Donoghue - would have little control over where he stays. Ahern also used a promotional television appearance on The Late Late Show on RTÉ One to defend O'Donoghue, claiming he had been [...] "dumped on".|$|R

500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, {{and she told him}} to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was surprised to hear that the Queen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> play herself, and wanted a speaking part.

500|$|Midway {{through the}} 2006–07 season Gillingham offered Jarvis a new contract, which the club {{described}} as the most lucrative it had ever offered to a player of his age. Jarvis rejected the contract offer, but later claimed via his agent that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> remain at Priestfield Stadium if the club [...] "demonstrated that it could match his ambitions". A number of Premier League and Championship clubs showed interest in signing Jarvis, and Plymouth Argyle made an unsuccessful bid for the player, manager Ian Holloway commenting that [...] "we did make a bid but it got knocked back". Towards {{the end of the}} season Nottingham Forest of League One made an offer of £650,000, hoping to circumvent the transfer window by taking the player on loan until {{the end of the season}}, but the bid was turned down by the player's agent.|$|E
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
