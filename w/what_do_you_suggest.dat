5000|$|Saul's {{birthmark}} {{is more of}} a symbol, but {{it still}} touches upon the theme of cultural hybridism. While Saul finds himself to be infatuated with the Machiguenga culture, his birthmark is essentially a constant reminder of the society from which he truly came. When interacting with Westerners, Saul gladly accepts any insults he is given that relate to the birthmark and even goes as far as to don the nickname [...] "Mascarita," [...] translating to [...] "mask-face." [...] When a drunk man calls him a monster and tells him to keep his face off the streets, Saul simply smiles and replies, [...] "but if this is the only one I've got, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> I do?" [...] (14). Despite this appearance of incivility, Saul finally gets relatively flustered when discussing the fact that the Machiguengas kill any newborns who are imperfect. Since Saul's face is scarred, he would not have made it into the Machiguenga society. The narrator notes that this was [...] "the only time he ever alluded, not jokingly but seriously, even dramatically, to what was undoubtedly a tragedy in his life" [...] (26). Since so many of his relationships in the past have been killed off by his imperfection, Saul seems most feared that his relationship with the Machiguengas will be marred by this permanent reminder of Western culture. That aside, the mark also helps accentuate the Machiguenga's practice of unity and collectivism, for in the end, they accept him as a person more than any Western culture did.|$|E
40|$|This study aims at apprehending the {{contribution}} of recreational activities {{in the treatment of}} hospitalized cancer patients and identifying the most stimulating resources for them. This is a qualitative research of phenomenological nature, it was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee, Protocol 139 / 2010. It was conducted with patients with cancer in a general hospital, located in Alfenas, in March and April, 2011. The research began from these guiding questions: What are your thoughts on the recreational team work and the activities they do? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> for this group to be developed? It was perceived that ludic activities help patients to face the disease, that they eased the interaction between the recreational group and the multiprofessional team, besides providing a happy and welcoming environment.

40|$|A 52 -year-old man {{presented}} with decreased vision {{in his right}} eye from 1 month ago. He had no history of systemic disorders or drug consumption. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1 / 10 in his right eye and 10 / 10 in the left eye at presentation. Anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure were within normal limits. Based on fundus examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Figures 1 and 2) and fluorescein angiography (FA) findings (Figures 3 and 4), he received 1. 25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in his right eye. After 6 weeks, he was {{not satisfied with the}} result and no improvement in BCVA was noted. OCT images (Figures 5 and 6), FA and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA, Figures 7 and 8) taken 6 weeks after injection are presented. ● What are the differential diagnoses? ● <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> for the management of this patient? Alireza Lashay, MD This 52 -year-old man has experienced decreased visual acuity in his right eye for more than 4 weeks. He received one 1. 25 mg IVB injection without any improvement in BCVA after 6 weeks. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images of the right eye shows a large geographic hyperfluorescent area with a mottled hypofluorescent center which corresponds to multiple pinpoint foci of hyperfluorescence extending from the disc margin to at least 2 disc diameters temporal to the macula based on FA. At the center of this geographic area a serous pigment epithelial detachment (PED) is formed which demonstrates gradual gain in fluorescence in a well delineated circular pattern. This finding is consistent with OCT images of Figure 1. Optical coherence tomogram of the right eye at presentatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on dealing with resistant clients is presented. Based on this review, the authors developed a survey designed to elicit counsellors ' reactions to and experiences with resistant clients. Responses received from 215 members of the American Mental Health Counselors Association suggest that nearly all counsellors have encountered resistant clients, but the counsellors ' reactions to and methods of dealing with these clients differ considerably Resume Cet article présente une revue de littérature se rapportant aux clients résistants. Basé sur cette revue, les auteurs ont développé un questionnaire dans le but de mettre àjour les réactions des conseillers face aux clients résistants et leurs expériences avec ceux-ci. Les réponses reçues de 215 membres de l'American Mental Health Counselors Association suggèrent que pratique-ment tous les conseillers ont rencontré des clients résistants, toutefois les réactions des conseil-lers face ces clients et leurs approches diffèrent considérablement. "I've tried everything I can think of with this client and nothing seems to work. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest?</b> " This is a question the authors have heard so many times, not only from students, but from seasoned professionals. The experience of coping with difficult clients seems to be one all counsellors share. It can be painful and frustrating or it can be challeng-ing and intriguing. According to Miller and Rollnick (1991), "Resistance is often the life of the play [...] The true art of therapy is tested in the recognition and handling of resistance. It is on this stage that the drama of change unfolds " (p. 112). However, not all therapists view resistance so positively. They may react by feeling threatened, frustrated, annoyed, resentful, exasperated, or angry. Fremont and Anderson (1986) found anger to be a particularly common response to resistance, although its likelihood was negatively correlated with amount of therapist experience. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present an overview of ways to understand and deal with difficult clients, according to both the literature and a survey of member...|$|E
