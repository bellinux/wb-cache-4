5000|$|Gaining a {{reputation}} as a stern taskmaster who expected top-notch work, he and John Ehrlichman were called [...] "the Berlin Wall" [...] by other White House staffers in a play on their German family names and shared penchant for keeping others away from Nixon and serving as his [...] "gatekeepers." [...] They became Nixon's most loyal and trusted aides during his presidency. Both were keen in protecting what they regarded as Nixon's best interests. He and the President were very close - Haldeman was even dubbed [...] "the President's son-of-a-bitch" [...] - and Nixon relied on him to filter information that came into his office {{and to make sure that}} information was properly dispensed.

50|$|Eventually Voloshin {{made it back}} to France, {{where he}} stayed until 1916. A year before the February Revolution in Russia, Voloshin {{returned}} to his home country and settled in Koktebel. He would live there until the end of his life. The ensuing Civil War prompted Voloshin to write long poems linking what was happening in Russia to its distant, mythologized past. Later, Voloshin would be accused of the worst sin in the Soviet ideologue's book: keeping aloof from the political struggle between Reds and Whites. In fact, he tried to protect the Whites from the Reds and the Reds from the <b>Whites.</b> His <b>house,</b> <b>today</b> a museum, still has a clandestine niche in which he hid people whose lives were in danger.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{and grounds}} cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the {{construction}} of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built {{on the west side of}} the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> grounds <b>today</b> is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by [...] President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson. Michelle Obama planted the <b>White</b> <b>House's</b> first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.|$|R
