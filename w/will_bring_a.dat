25|$|Dhutanga (meaning austere {{practice}} Thai: Tudong) {{is a word}} generally used in the commentaries {{to refer}} to the thirteen ascetic practices. In Thai Buddhism it has been adapted to refer to extended periods of wandering in the countryside, where monks will take {{one or more of these}} ascetic practices. During these periods monks will live off of whatever is given to them by laypersons they encounter during the trip, and sleep wherever they can. Sometimes monks <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> large umbrella-tent with attached mosquito netting known as a crot (also spelled krot, clot, or klod). The crot will usually have a hook on the top so it may be hung on a line tied between two trees.|$|E

500|$|The local {{transportation}} company, CTP, manages a tram line {{that runs through}} the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, long use expectancy and higher transit speed – [...] The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street, between the Chamber of Commerce and the central rail station, a rather problematic area. This dilemma should be solved either with the relocation of the track next to the sidewalk, or through the construction of a suspended tunnel. Another area that will benefit from large-scale changes is [...] "Splaiul Independenței", where the tracks will be pulled back to the Central Park, so that the roadway can host two lanes. In the Mănăștur area, under the bridge, the tracks will be brought closer, while other major works will executed on the traffic circle on Primăverii Street. Given the development of the metropolitan area, further plans feature the creation of a light rail track between Gilău and Jucu that will use these modernised tracks in the city.|$|E

[...] Brad Wright hoped that [...] "what Corin, as Jonas, will bring to the show is a renewed sense of amazement" [...] of traveling around the galaxy although older characters have grown accustomed to it. The season6 opening two-parter [...] "Redemption" [...] intended to establish Jonas as a team player who can contribute ideas, although writer Robert C. Cooper felt the need to acknowledge and not [...] "trivialize what the [...] character meant to the team and to the show for five seasons". The writers incorporated the initial viewer resistance to the change by making O'Neill the most resistant to Jonas' presence, allowing viewers to grieve Daniel and gradually come to terms with his absence. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join SG-1 on his former reluctance to shut off the machine that indirectly killed Daniel, and his feelings of responsibility for Daniel's death. [...] Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over the first half of season 6.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra started 1967 with {{a series}} of {{recording}} sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, {{which was one of the}} best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. According to Santopietro the album [...] "consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret". Writer Stan Cornyn noted that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950. Sinatra also released the album The World We Knew, which features a chart-topping duet of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album Francis A. & Edward K.. According to Granata, the recording of [...] "Indian Summer" [...] on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the [...] "contemplative mood [...] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> tear to your eye". With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song [...] "My Way", using the melody of the French [...] "Comme d'habitude" [...] ("As Usual"), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it just after Christmas 1968. [...] "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the US and #5 in the UK, but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he [...] "detested" [...] singing the song, because he believed audiences would think it was a [...] "self-aggrandizing tribute", professing that he [...] "hated boastfulness in others".|$|E

5000|$|The {{root of the}} paradoxes lies in a {{mismatch}} between {{the interpretation of the}} validity of logical implication in natural language, and its formal interpretation in classical logic, dating back to George Boole's algebraic logic. In classical logic, implication describes conditional if-then statements using a truth-functional interpretation, i.e. [...] "p implies q" [...] is defined to be [...] "it is not the case that p is true and q false". Also, [...] "p implies q" [...] is equivalent to [...] "p is false or q is true". For example, [...] "if it is raining, then I <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> umbrella", is equivalent to [...] "it is not raining, or I <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> umbrella, or both".
