They were parts of two different imperial circles. From 1500 on the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and thus its successor Duchy of Bremen belonged to the Saxon Circle (later the Lower Saxon Circle; Sächsischer or later Niedersächsischer Kreis), a fiscal and military substructure of the Empire. The Prince-Bishopric of Verden and thus its successor, the Duchy of Verden, on the other hand, belonged to the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle (Niederrheinisch-Westfälischer Kreis, colloquially Westphalian Circle).|$|R

The model based on union participation theories, in which perceived <b>union</b> <b>support</b> was an antecedent of union instrumentality and led to union loyalty and subsequently union participation, was not <b>supported.</b> <b>Union</b> instrumentality was related to union commitment, but the relation was completely mediated by perceived <b>union</b> <b>support...</b>|$|R

Survey data collected among union members from three European countries (The Netherlands, Italy and Sweden) indicate that job insecurity is associated with reduced levels of job satisfaction, well-being and organisational commitment.

40|$|Orientation: The {{study of}} work stressors, job {{insecurity}} and <b>union</b> <b>support</b> creates opportunity for iron ore mining organisations to manage {{job satisfaction and}} safety motivation and behaviour more effectively. Research purpose: The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between work stressors, job insecurity, <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> job satisfaction and safety motivation and behaviour of a sample of iron ore mine workers in South Africa. Motivation for the study: The mining industry in general is often faced with hazardous and physically demanding working environments, where employees work under constant pressure. Work stressors, job insecurity, <b>union</b> <b>support</b> and job satisfaction are considered key variables when investigating effective means of managing safety. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was utilised to collect the data. A convenience sample of employees in the iron ore mining industry of South Africa (N = 260) were included. Structural equation modelling and bootstrapping resampling analysis were used to analyse the data. Main findings: Work stressors and job insecurity were found to be negatively associated with job satisfaction. Conversely, perceived <b>union</b> <b>support</b> was positively associated with job satisfaction and safety motivation and behaviour. Furthermore, job satisfaction mediated the relationship between <b>union</b> <b>support</b> and safety motivation and behaviour. Practical/managerial implications: Mining organisations can, by placing the focus on reducing work stressors, and promoting job security and <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> achieve higher levels of safety motivation and behaviour through job satisfaction. Contribution/value-add: A great deal of independent research on work stressors, job insecurity, <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> job satisfaction as well as safety motivation and behaviour has already been done. To date, very little empirical research exists that simultaneously considers all these constructs. This study brought together these lines of research. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{consequences}} of job insecurity among union members. Starting from {{the dominance of the}} instrumental motive for union membership, and using psychological contract theory, we hypothesize that the perception of job insecurity will correlate with a lower level of perceived <b>union</b> <b>support</b> and a higher intention to resign union membership. We also test whether the relationship between job insecurity and membership turnover is mediated by (a lack of) perceived <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> The hypotheses are tested in four European countries: Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. In three countries, an association is found between job insecurity and a reduction in perceived <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> and between job insecurity and the intention to resign membership. The association between job insecurity and membership turnover intentions is also fully mediated by (a lack of) perceived <b>union</b> <b>support</b> in these three countries. None of the hypotheses are corroborated in Sweden. The {{results of this study suggest}} that union members in all countries involved but Sweden experience job insecurity as a violation of the psychological contract with their union.

The role conflict scale (Rizzo, House, & Lirtzman, 1970), role overload (qualitative and quantitative) scale (Beehr, Walsh, & Taber, 1976; Sverke, Hellgren, & Öhrming, 1999), job insecurity scale (Hellgren, Sverke, & Isaksson, 1999), <b>union</b> <b>support</b> scale (Shore, Tetrick, Sinclair, & Newton, 1994), job satisfaction scale (Hellgren, Sjöberg & Sverke, 1997), safety motivation scale (Neal, Griffin, & Hart, 2000), safety behaviour scale (Neal et al., 2000) and a biographical questionnaire were administered to employees (N = 260) from the mining industry.

Increased levels of work stressors and job insecurity were found to be associated with decreased levels of job satisfaction.
