But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E

25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E

Prefacing his introduction to the Mongol empire, which was larger than the British empire and lasted as long, he said: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> not <b>to</b> recognize the greatness of Europe. But it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equally <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> forget the greatness of Asia." ...|$|R

25|$|Ida S. Scudder {{realized}} that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> go on alone in her fight to bring better health to South India's women. So she decided to open a medical school for girls. Skeptical males said she would be lucky to get three applicants; actually she had 151 the first year (1918), and has had to turn many away ever since. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but since Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational it {{has the support of}} 40 missions. Of 242 students today, 95 are men.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E
500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune." [...] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E
2500|$|Carl Sagan {{included}} telekinesis in a {{long list}} of [...] "offerings of pseudoscience and superstition" [...] which [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> accept (...) without solid scientific data".

2500|$|Ratzinger did not {{directly}} say whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions, but did say in this same context that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> construct an impulsive apologetic {{on the basis of}} such views." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{provoked}} Hitler to send Canaris to Spain {{again in}} an effort to convince Franco to join the Axis and soften his [...] "outrageous" [...] demands.

2500|$|Scholars {{and historians}} such as James H. Charlesworth caution against using {{parallels}} with life-death-rebirth gods in the widespread mystery religions {{prevalent in the}} Hellenistic culture to conclude that Jesus is a purely legendary figure. Charlesworth argues that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> continue to foster the illusion that the Gospels are merely fictional stories like the legends of Hercules and Asclepius. The theologies in the New Testament are grounded on interpretations of real historical events…" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side of the issue are those who have claimed that the {{increase}} is not significant, that it doesn't matter because America's economic growth and/or equality of opportunity are what's important, that it is a global phenomenon which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> try to change through US domestic policy, that it [...] "has many economic benefits and is the result of ... a well-functioning economy", and has or may become an excuse for [...] "class-warfare rhetoric", and may lead to policies that [...] "reduce the well-being of wealthier individuals".|$|E

"'T <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> quarrel {{about an}} idee," [...] March cried, as he resumed his meal, [...] "and more like {{lawyers in the}} towns than like {{sensible}} men in the woods.

[...] In 2003, speaking at a meeting of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, Deming said, [...] "I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> try to predict what our technological capabilities will be , just as it would have been foolish for someone from the 19th century to try to predict what we could do today." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 May, German High Command grew very confident. The Allies seemed {{incapable}} {{of coping with}} events. There appeared to be no serious threat from the south – indeed General Franz Halder, Chief of Army General Staff, {{toyed with the idea}} of attacking Paris immediately to knock France out of the war in one blow. The Allied troops in the north were retreating to the river Scheldt, their right flank giving way to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> remain inactive any longer, allowing them to reorganize their defence or escape. Now it was time to bring them into even more serious trouble by cutting them off. The next day the Panzer Corps started moving again, smashed through the weak British 12th and 23rd Territorial divisions, occupied Amiens and secured the westernmost bridge over the river Somme at Abbeville isolating the British, French, Dutch and Belgian forces in the north. In the evening of 20 May, a reconnaissance unit from 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles, [...] to the west, where they could see the estuary of the Somme flowing into The Channel.|$|E
