60|$|But Diabolus and his outlandish {{men were}} not at peace in Mansoul; for they were not there entertained as were the captains and forces of Emmanuel: the townsmen did browbeat them what they could; nor did they partake or make stroy {{of any of the}} {{necessaries}} of Mansoul, but that which they seized on against the townsmen's will: <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>they</b> hid from them, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not, <b>they</b> had with an ill-will. They, poor hearts! had rather have had their room than their company; but they were at present their captives, and their captives for the present they were forced to be. But, I say, they discountenanced them as much as they were able, and showed them all the dislike that <b>they</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R

2500|$|As one of {{the first}} music {{producer}} auteurs, he (along with George Martin) popularized the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool. Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, Wilson ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus {{one of the}} first rock groups to exert studio control. Brother Carl Wilson explained the significance of Brian's control over the group's productions: [...] "Record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> say? Brian made good records." [...] Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Wilson's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds. In the late 1960s, Wilson also started a trend of [...] "project" [...] recording, where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studio.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{recovery}} from the bout of illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at Syracuse University in 1960, studying journalism, film directing, and creative writing. He was a platoon leader in ROTC and was later expelled from the program for holding an unloaded gun to his superior's head. In 1961, he began hosting a late-night radio program on WAER called Excursions On A Wobbly Rail. Named after a song by pianist Cecil Taylor, the program typically featured doo wop, rhythm and blues, and jazz, particularly the free jazz developed in the mid-1950s. Many of Reed's guitar techniques, such as the guitar-drum roll, were inspired by jazz saxophonists, such as Ornette Coleman. Reed's sister Merrill offered the following recollection of her brother's time spent at Syracuse: [...] " [...] started a band, {{he had his own}} radio show. [...] He reportedly libeled some student on his radio show; the kid's family tried to sue my father. And there were other extracurricular possibly illegal activities of which the university didn't approve. I believe they tried to kick him out. But he was a genius; <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> do? [...] He stayed and he graduated." [...] Reed graduated with honors from Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences with a B.A. in English in June 1964.|$|E

2500|$|The huge {{explosion}} of workers coming {{to live in}} cities like Richmond, caused intense strain on city infrastructure. One of these strains was the severe lack of housing.
