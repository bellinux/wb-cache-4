25|$|The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads {{are known}} as the warp, and the cross way threads {{are known as}} the weft. The warp which must be strong needs to be {{presented}} to loom on a <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> The weft passes across the loom in a shuttle, that carries the yarn on a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of a thunderstorm, {{according}} to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> on which a twin sister had wound warp yarns, the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew. With this he would run directly toward the cloud, looking neither left nor right, nor watching where he treads. Once on the field, Nikola would stick the scythe into the ground, and say a prayer for lightning to strike. Having gone away from the scythe, he would make {{the sign of the}} cross with the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> in the direction of the cloud, to break it into quarters. Further beneath it, he would shake the cloud apart using the pellets and dew. There he also addressed the souls of the drowned and hanged leading the cloud, praying them that the [...] "rain like this dew" [...] fall, and spoke various other prayers. For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers. He was eventually warned by the authorities to stop with these activities, branded backward superstition by them.|$|E

30|$|In {{this section}} total l 447 cone {{packages}} {{were set to}} the creel. Then machine was run at 300  rpm and produced ten ball <b>warper</b> <b>beam.</b> Each ball <b>warper</b> <b>beam</b> contain 4200  m length rope with 447 ends.|$|R
30|$|In long chain beaming (LCB) section, these ropes {{were opened}} into the sheet form of yarn and wound onto a <b>warper</b> <b>beam.</b> After {{ending of the}} LCB process ten warpers beam were {{produced}} for sizing.|$|R
50|$|Seersucker {{is made by}} slack-tension weave. The threads are wound {{onto the}} two <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> in groups of 10 to 16 for a narrow stripe. The stripes are always in the warp {{direction}} and ongrain. Today, seersucker is produced by {{a limited number of}} manufacturers. It is a low-profit, high-cost item because of its slow weaving speed.|$|R
5000|$|Let off motion [...] - [...] {{letting the}} warp wound on a <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> when the cloth {{is taken up}} on the cloth roller beam.|$|E
5000|$|Let off Motion: {{where the}} warp is let off the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> at a {{regulated}} speed {{to make the}} filling even and of the required design ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of the loom are the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations.|$|E
5000|$|With each weaving operation, {{the newly}} {{constructed}} fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or {{released from the}} <b>warp</b> <b>beams.</b> To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.|$|R
5000|$|Selvedge denim {{refers to}} a unique type of {{selvedge}} that is made by passing one continuous cross-yarn (the weft) {{back and forth through}} the vertical <b>warp</b> <b>beams.</b> This is traditionally finished at both edges with a contrasting warp (most commonly red); that is why this type of denim is sometimes referred to as [...] "red selvedge." [...] This method of weaving the selvage is possible only when using a shuttle loom.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{secondary}} motions, {{because with}} each weaving operation the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or {{released from the}} <b>warp</b> <b>beams.</b> To become fully automatic, a loom needs a tertiary motion, the filling stop motion. This will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks. An automatic loom requires 0.125 hp to 0.5 hp to operate.|$|R
50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> passes over a {{friction}} guide roller, where it horizontally {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The cloth beam bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A ratchet wheel is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|E
50|$|The major {{components}} of the loom are the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> heddles, harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. These are the principal motions.|$|E
5000|$|The heavy {{warp thread}} {{that needs to}} be warped from a creel of spools or cones onto a <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> There will be one thread for each end. There are two set of warp thread, right twist and left twist,- one used for {{stability}} and the other used for twisting.|$|E
50|$|In Darvel, East Ayrshire, the weavers relaxed {{by playing}} curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms' <b>warp</b> <b>beams,</b> {{fitted with a}} {{detachable}} handle for the purpose. Many a wife would keep her husband's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece, brightly polished until the next time it was needed. Central Canadian curlers often used 'irons' rather than stones until the early 1900s, Canada {{is the only country}} known to have done so, while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} the warp vision on living {{entities}} was demonstrated when Rick, trapped in Sleepwalker's body after an encounter with the Chain Gang, inadvertently used the beam on his former girlfriend Alyssa Conover, {{who was about to}} kill Sleepwalker in Rick's body. Sleepwalker's vision causes living bodies to twist and contort, causing intense physical agony in the process, although this effect is only temporary. The beam also has the side effect of breaking the mental control of any outside entity possessing the victim's mind, expelling the controller in the process. As a result, Rick unintentionally freed Alyssa from the domination of the Chain Gang, a tactic Sleepwalker himself would later adopt when freeing other people from the mental enslavement of Cobweb's minions, using his ability to detect mental enslavement to identify the humans who needed his help. In these cases, when he used his <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> on their human victims, the humans suffered little to no mental trauma, only experiencing a mild [...] that they quickly recovered from. Alyssa Conover, on the other hand, suffered both the physical pain of her contortion and a serious mental shock from the effects of Sleepwalker's <b>warp</b> <b>beams,</b> which according to Sleepwalker forced her to repeatedly experience her worst nightmares. It seems that the mindspawn demons, who had completely suppressed the wills of their human victims and had completely taken over their bodies, took the brunt of the blast. In Alyssa's case, on the other hand, the Chain Gang did not completely take over her body, but rather attempted to force her conscious mind to do their bidding, leaving her vulnerable to the full {{effects of the}} beam.|$|R
30|$|To {{predict the}} scope of support {{pressure}} zone in coal mining, this paper focuses on analysis over the features of stress transformation {{in front of the}} working face. Based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) damage identification of the <b>warped</b> <b>beam</b> structure (WBS), a mechanical analysis model was optimized, from which a quantifying formula for calculating {{the scope of}} the support pressure zone (SPZ) in front of the mechanized working face during the periodic weighting stage was derived. The algorithm of fuzzy neural network optimization for transfer coefficient of elastic damage (TCOED) offers a method and basis to predict the stress state in front of the working face. The research results have guiding significance to computer intelligence monitoring for coal mines.|$|R
5000|$|The warp passes {{down the}} lace in {{straight}} lines, the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> {{is at the}} bottom and the thread passes through a sley, and then the front guide bar, the warp bar. The warp bar is controlled by a cam. All warps remain in parallel; they cannot pattern, they form the skeletal support for the fabric.|$|E
50|$|In {{general the}} {{supporting}} {{structure of the}} loom is called the frame. It provides the means of fixing the length-wise threads, called the warp, and keeping them under tension. The warp threads are wound on a roller called the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> and attached to the cloth beam which will hold the finished material. Because of the tension the warp threads are under, {{they need to be}} strong.|$|E
5000|$|Credit for the {{invention}} is usually {{given to a}} mechanic called Josiah Crane in 1775. He likely sold his invention to Richard March who patented (No. 1186) a warp frame in 1778. In the intervening three years March likely had discussed the device with Morris who submitted a similar patent (No.1282) for a twisting machine for making Brussels point lace. These early machines were modifications of the stocking frame with an additional <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
50|$|It has two <b>warp</b> <b>beams,</b> {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R
5000|$|Sleepwalker {{possesses}} superhuman strength, exceptional {{durability and}} resistance to injury, and flotation-like flight. He is also capable of the projection of crude images of what he's seen from his eyes. His only offensive power was his [...] "warp gaze". With this vision-based power, Sleepwalker could alter the shape of physical objects and twist them to his purposes. He could also modify the physical characteristics of the objects he affected-making them harder or softer, for example. Sleepwalker initially demonstrated this power by using it to distort a sidewalk to capture a criminal. He also used this ability once on air molecules to create a wind tunnel for faster aerial travel. Owing to an oath sworn by all members of his race due to the great physical and mental pain it could cause, Sleepwalker tried not to use his <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> on living entities.|$|R
25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|R

50|$|The warp {{is sized}} in a starch mixture for {{smoother}} running. The loom warped (loomed or dressed) by passing the sized warp threads through {{two or more}} heddles attached to harnesses. The power weavers loom is warped by separate workers. Most looms used for industrial purposes have a machine that ties new warps threads to the waste of previously used warps threads, while still on the loom, then an operator rolls {{the old and new}} threads back on the <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> The harnesses are controlled by cams, dobbies or a Jacquard head.|$|E
50|$|The {{warp threads}} {{need to be}} {{strengthened}} by appying a wet size (a process called dressing) and then wound onto a beam or roller that fitted {{on the back of}} the loom (a process called <b>warping</b> or <b>beaming).</b> These processes were time consuming, if dressing took place on the loom, the loom had to remain idle till the threads dried thus the economics of weaving still favoured the hardloom weaver. It was William Radcliffe, also of Stockport who introduced the dressing frame in 1803.|$|R
50|$|This was {{designed}} as a ring mill (thus lower head room was required than in a mule mill) it was 345 feet (105 m)by 130 feet (40 m) It was four storeys high. The cellar contained a warehouse, yarn cellar, waste room, cotton room, and dust room. The first floor was the card room. The second floor was the ring frame room. The third floor was the winding, <b>warping</b> and <b>beaming</b> room. The chimney was 210 feet (64 m), it and the boiler house were demolished in 1964.|$|R
40|$|Multilayer {{microwave}} circuit processing {{technology is}} essential in developing more compact radio frequency (RF) electronically scanned arrays (ESAs) for next generation radar systems. ESAs are typically realized using the hybrid connection of four discrete components: RF manifold, phase shifters or Butler matrices, antennas and T/R modules. The hybrid connection of these components increases the system size, packaging cost and introduces parasitic effects that lead to higher losses. In order to eliminate these drawbacks, {{there is a need}} to integrate these components on the same substrate, forming a monolithic phased array. RF MEMS technology enables the monolithic integration of the ESA components into one highly integrated multifunctional module, thereby enhancing ESA designs by significantly reducing size, fabrication cost and interconnection losses. A novel capacitive dual-warped beam shunt MEMS switch is presented that utilizes <b>warped</b> <b>beams</b> to enhance its RF performance. This switch exhibits an off-to-on capacitive ratio of almost 170, isolation better than 40 dB, switching speeds as low as 6 μs without the need for thin dielectrics or high dielectric constant materials. These MEMS switches are implemented into single pole three throw (SP 3 T) and single pole four throw (SP 4 T) configurations. A novel 3 -bit finite ground coplanar waveguide switched delay line MEMS phase shifter is developed with four cascaded SP 3 T dual-warped beam capacitive switches to achieve low-loss performance and simplify ESA design. The fabricated prototype unit exhibits an insertion loss of 2. 5 ∓ 0. 2 dB with a phase error of ∓ 6 °. Moreover, a compact 4 x 4 Butler matrix switchable with the use of a MEMS SP 4 T switch is investigated as an alternative passive beamforming method. The overall beam-switching network is monolithically integrated within a real-estate area of 0. 49 cm 2. This technique provides a unique approach to fabricate the entire beamforming network monolithically. An 8 -mask fabrication process is developed that monolithically integrates the MEMS phase shifter and RF combining network on one substrate. The wafer-scale integrated ESA prototype unit has an area of 2. 2 cm 2. It serves as the basic building block to construct larger scanning array modules and introduces a new level of functionality previously achieved only by the use of larger, heavier and expensive system...|$|R
5000|$|In 1795, {{the machine}} was {{successfully}} used to make lacey fabrics. [...] Warp frames could be used with any thread, and the warps provided a fixed anchor for the transverse threads. In 1786 Flint invented the point bar which kept the threads at a fixed distance. In 1796, Dawson introduced cams to move the bars, and regulate the twist. Brown and Copstake succeeded in imitating Mechlen net. Lindley invented the bobbin in 1799, and Irving and Skelton the regulator spring. In 1802, Robert Brown of New Radford patented the first twist-frame, a knitter that could produce wide net.Whittaker's frame of 1804 had half its thread mounted on a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> and half wound on bobbins mounted on a carriage.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> {{was at the}} top, and {{the work}} roller at the bottom. There was a sley and a guide bar.The {{carriages}} with their bobbins (brass bobbins) slid on a concave comb (bolt). In the 1825 modification, the carriages were suspended from a upwardly arching comb. The carriages are propelled by individual pusher rods which strike the ears on the carriage. There was pusher bar (later there were four) {{but there is a}} fetcher bar (locker bar) which act in conjunctions with the pushers [...] It was slow and in the early machine 14 actions were required to form each course; in 1825 this had been reduced to ten. The bobbins were necessarily small and this restricted the length of a single piece to about 4 metres The actions were controlled by an organ barrel until the adoption of the Jacquard process in 1839. This was achieved by James Wright of Radford.|$|E
30|$|Sheikhzadeh et al. (2007) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the ratio of the force applied on the warp yarn by the whip roller to the warp yarn tension, and the vertical and horizontal position of the whip roller with variations in <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> radius during the weaving process.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{manufacture}} the raw cotton is procured by the weavers from the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation. Cotton 3/10s, an unbleached yarn, {{is used for the}} warp and cotton 10s of 6-ply is used for weft. The yarns could also be purchased from the market in Hubli. After procurement of the required material, pre-weaving process is started. This is a four-stage process. The first step being preparation of warp, which is a set of threads which runs through the length of the durries and which is covered by the weft. The decision on the length of the durrie is dictated by the 3/10s cotton converted into balls. While warp of the small durries are made in the open yard of the house, in the case of larger size durries of say 8 x 12 ft size, the warps are made in large open grounds in the town. Then a detailed work procedure is followed with sticks to warp the required number of threads. This warp is then shifted to the loom inside the house and weaving is done in a set pattern using <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> of the looms, sticks and threads. The yarn of the weft 10s cotton is then dyed with dyes of black, yellow, red, brown, blue and green colours, mixed with water, and the hanks are kept in the dye solution for 20 minutes before removal and drying. The warp is fixed on the loom (which is of vertical design, quite ancient, unlike the horizontal loom used at the ground level at other places in the country) and adequately stretched to obtain the required tension. The weaving is then started by two weavers facing each other. Patterns are introduced in the warp at the appropriate stage of weaving. Vertical and diagonal lines are marked and weaved suitably. Weft is then covered over the warp, and this covering decides the quality of the durries. Weft is layered over the warp and pressed properly by beating and tamping. The cloth beam is used to wind the cloth as the durrie gets made. The designs are decided by the weavers intuitively. The progress achieved on each loom is about 6 in per day.|$|R
50|$|In 1792, Dr Cartwright {{obtained}} {{his last}} patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes.However all his efforts were unavailing; {{it became apparent}} that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the <b>beam</b> <b>warper,</b> and the dressing sizing machine.|$|R
40|$|Continuously-reinforced {{concrete}} pavement (CRCP) {{is widely used}} in transportation system because of its low maintenance requirement. However, the need for large volumes of steel creates a high cost for new construction. The Illinois Tollway is preparing to substantially renovate highways in and around Chicago and this work seeks to understand how concretes of varying mixture designs can be made thinner by {{reducing the amount of}} built-in stress. The experiment examines <b>warping</b> in <b>beams</b> subjected to various degrees of restraint, in an effort to assess effectiveness at reducing warping in continuously reinforced {{concrete pavement}}s. Value added methodologies such as internal curing with fine lightweight aggregate and topically-applied shrinkage-reducing admixture (SRA) were applied to a controlled concrete mixture design. The experimental program examines the warping of a composite concrete-steel beam with differing degrees of restraint, accomplished through using a 1 / 42 ̆ 2 and ½” steel plate with a 2. 52 ̆ 2 concrete section.
