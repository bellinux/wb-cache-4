5|$|For the Antwerp {{publisher}} Ons Volk, {{he created}} three comics, published as books without a prepublication {{in a newspaper}} or magazine. Piwo, about the adventures of a wooden horse, became his first comic album in 1943, and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946. Those comics were also published in French. For the same editor, he illustrated 11 children books. In the same years, he also created the cover illustration {{for a number of}} novels from other publishers. In 1944, he also started working for two more magazines, De Rakker and De Illustratie, where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations. To help him <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> work, his wife Paula inked many of his pencil drawings in these years.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

25|$|The country {{used to be}} one of Africa's richest and is now one of its poorest. Many {{observers}} now {{view the}} country as a 'failed state'. The settlement of the Second Congo War brought back Zimbabwe's substantial military commitment, although some troops remain to secure the mining assets under their control. The government lacks the resources or machinery to deal with the ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which affects 25% of the population. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> and the forced and violent removal of white farmers in a brutal land redistribution program, Mugabe has earned himself widespread scorn from the international arena.|$|E

25|$|Colonel William C. Gorgas {{had been}} {{appointed}} chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly yellow fever and malaria which had recently {{been shown to be}} mosquito-borne following the work of Dr. Carlos Finlay and Dr. Walter Reed. There was investment in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the Commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated. Nevertheless, even <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> effort, about 5,600 workers died of disease and accidents during the U.S. construction phase of the canal.|$|E
25|$|The peasants were discontented {{because of}} many other factors, as well, {{including}} crop failure, and epidemics, especially a major epidemic in 1771. The nobles were also imposing a stricter rule than ever, reducing the land of each serf and restricting their freedoms further beginning around 1767. Their discontent led to widespread outbreaks of violence and rioting during Pugachev's Rebellion of 1774. The serfs probably followed someone who was pretending to be the true tsar because of their feelings of disconnection to Catherine and her policies empowering the nobles, {{but this was not}} the first time they followed a pretender under Catherine’s reign. Pugachev had made stories about himself acting as a real tsar should, helping the common people, listening to their problems, praying for them, and generally acting saintly, and this helped rally the peasants and serfs, with their very conservative values, to his cause. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> discontent in mind, Catherine did rule for 10 years before the anger of the serfs boiled over into a rebellion as extensive as Pugachev’s. Under Catherine’s rule, though, despite her enlightened ideals, the serfs were generally unhappy and discontented.|$|E

On October 22, 2005, Cunningham discussed the potential series further. He explained that the idea was to call the series Crystal Lake Chronicles, and [...] "set [...] in a town <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> Jason history".

Noisey's Daisy Jones interpreted the words as a reference to Australian singer Sia's 2013 single [...] "Elastic Heart", {{who served as the}} executive producer of Daddy Issues. The song continues with the lyrics: [...] "Living for the days, living for the nights, living for the chance to give what's right, now tell me who the hell you think I am." [...] During the song's hook, Candy sings [...] "Why do all the good girls have to die/ Living in a bad girl's paradise"; Yasmeen Gharnit wrote that the section discusses how women must discard their innocence to achieve independence.

[...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back.

500|$|Brodie {{suggested}} that Stevens's hatred of Johnson {{was the only}} thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan. [...] Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, Alexander McClure, [...] "My life has been a failure. [...] <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania. When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, [...] "I have no history. My life-long regret is that I have lived so long and so uselessly." [...] Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that [...] "man still is vile. [...] But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal.

[...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but a bit on the dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year."
