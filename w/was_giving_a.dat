5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Randy Orton versus Shelton Benjamin in a singles match for Orton's Intercontinental Championship. On the May 17 episode of Raw, Randy Orton, {{who was a}} villain, <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> speech. Shelton Benjamin interrupted Orton's speech and challenged Orton to an Intercontinental Championship match. The challenge, however, was denied by Orton, in which prompted Benjamin to attack Orton. The following week, an all-out brawl ensued between Orton and Chris Jericho. The brawl brought out fellow Evolution member, a group of wrestlers, Batista, to Orton's aid. Benjamin also {{made his way to}} the ring and evened the sides. As a result of the brawl, Bischoff announced a tag team match, in which Benjamin and Jericho defeated Orton and Batista. On the May 31 episode of Raw, it was announced that Orton would defend the Intercontinental Championship against Benjamin at Bad Blood.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} from the CDC protest in Atlanta, Petrelis {{received}} a call from playwright Larry Kramer, asking to meet. Having read the news of the Lavender Hill Mob's actions at the CDC, Kramer wanted to discuss such confrontational tactics as ringing the White House with protesters, disrupting congress, and shutting down Wall Street. Kramer told Petrelis he <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> speech at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on the upcoming Tuesday night, as a last-minute substitute for the scheduled speaker, writer Nora Ephron. Kramer urged Petrelis to invite everyone he knew.|$|E

25|$|A {{couple of}} months later, on 2 August Leggio, Riina, Provenzano {{and a number of}} other gunmen set up an ambush just outside Corleone. Michele Navarra soon drove round the corner and the gunmen opened fire, {{riddling}} the car with two hundred bullets. Navarra died instantly along with a friend (unconnected with the Mafia); he <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> lift to another doctor, Giovanni Russo. Leggio proclaimed himself boss of Corleone and over the next five years he and his men hunted down and killed around fifty more of Navarra's remaining supporters.|$|E
25|$|There, {{a fabulous}} welcome awaited them. On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese {{men and women}} waved and cheered and a brass band {{on the end of}} the mole <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> {{spirited}} rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's thought for the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since the creaking plates showed that Ohio might still go to the bottom of the Grand Harbour.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a {{professor}} in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo, took Hachikō, a golden brown Akita, as a pet. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō would leave the house to greet him {{at the end of each}} day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued the daily routine until May 1925, when Ueno did not return. The professor had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, while he <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> lecture, and died without ever returning to the train station in which Hachikō would wait.|$|E

25|$|When a freedman of Nero <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> gladiatorial show at Antium, {{the public}} porticoes {{were covered with}} paintings, so we are told, {{containing}} life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited {{a picture of the}} matches in the Grove of Diana.|$|E
25|$|News that Ford {{was working}} on {{translating}} Charles Paul de Kock's began to be noted in 1902, and 1903. News spread (in Kansas City and Kansas) that the Bahá'í Faith was being promoted in New England, and in July Ford <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> series of talks at Greenacre. In September a talk of hers, amplified by quotes translated by Ali Kuli Khan from Mirza Abu Fazl, was profiled in the Boston Journal - it reviewed spirituality and history as a call for a new religion. She was then published giving talks in Boston in October, and November. By December Bahá'ís in Chicago knew she was a Bahá'í and working with Sarah Farmer on projects. A talk of hers in December was also noted in the Boston Herald.|$|E
25|$|In {{significant}} respects, Jinsai {{can be seen}} as {{advancing the}} Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the Gomō jigi (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Analects and Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) Xingli ziyi 性理字義 (The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's Gomō jigi as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, jigi and ziyi 字義 (Jpn: jigi) being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, the words that were discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as tendō (the way of heaven), tenmei (the decree of heaven), michi (the way), sei (human nature), kokoro (the mind and heart), kotowari (principle), kishin (ghosts and spirits), and many others.|$|E

Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, Nancy McIntosh, to a country estate, Grim's Dyke. He was knighted in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> swimming lesson in the lake at his home.|$|E

500|$|During the {{sessions}} for Parsley, the duo cut [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] {{and decided to}} release it as a single then, where it peaked at number 13 on the national charts.

Simon began work for Bookends around this time, noting to a writer at High Fidelity that [...] "I'm not interested in singles anymore". He had hit a dry spell in his writing, which led to no Simon & Garfunkel album on the horizon for 1967. Artists {{at the time were}} expected to release two, perhaps three albums each year and the lack of productivity from the duo worried executives at Columbia Records. Amid concerns for Simon's idleness, Columbia Records chairman Clive Davis arranged for up-and-coming record producer John Simon to kick-start the recording.
