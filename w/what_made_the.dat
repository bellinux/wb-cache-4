5|$|Sounds {{right fielder}} Caleb Gindl became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> rare occurrence even more unusual {{is that the}} ball first bounced off Schafer's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E

25|$|Bellone had 34 guns, {{including}} 24 long 8-pounder guns, {{and though}} she had more guns, her broadside was inferior to that on Lord Nelson. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> difference was that Bellone had a crew of 260 men, versus the 102 men, exclusive of passengers, on Lord Nelson. However, Bellone also had on board some 56 prisoners from various captures.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} any packing {{arrangement}} that disproved the Kepler conjecture {{would have to}} be an irregular one. But eliminating all possible irregular arrangements is very difficult, and this is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Kepler conjecture so hard to prove. In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume always reduces their density.|$|E

25|$|<b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Parson {{stand out}} was, more than {{anything}} else, his vitriolic tongue and pen. Over {{the course of his}} long career he took up many causes. These included not only Methodism, Whiggery, and the Union, but also temperance, Know-Nothingism, and slavery. His favorite method of promoting those causes was to chastise and ridicule his opponents, and few men could do so with as much venomous wit as he. Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics, Mormons, Democrats, Republicans, secessionists, drunks, immigrants, and abolitionists-all were {{at one time or another}} on the receiving end of Brownlow's merciless broadsides. Not surprisingly, he made many enemies. A number of them replied in kind; some tried to kill him.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{previous}} international tours to the West Indies the schedule of the WSC tour was rigorous. The previous year the official Australia side had conducted {{a tour of}} the West Indies that took in five Test matches, two ODIs and six tour matches from 17 February to 3 May. The WSC tour featured five Supertests and twelve ODIs from 20 February to 13 April. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> tour so physically demanding were the back to back ODIs and constant travelling between Islands with only a day between fixtures. On top of the gruelling itinerary, the cricket was intense and of the highest standard, unlike traditional tours that feature matches against weak opposition.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of {{this new}} format, {{as well as the}} boring hockey, was <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> NHL revert the format of the All-Star Game to its {{original}} incarnation. Some of the criticisms included the fact that teammates often opposed each other in the All-Star Game under the new format, and some stated that the early date of the game was detrimental to the exposure of the NHL in the States, being held {{at the same time as}} the World Series and the National Football League (NFL) season. In what would be later a reality, Toronto Star columnist Red Burnett suggested that the game should be played mid-season and that fans should choose their starting lineup, a system which had long been in use in the States with regard to Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} liberalisation in India {{refers to the}} {{economic liberalisation}}, initiated in 1991, of the country's economic policies, {{with the goal of}} making the economy more market and service-oriented and expanding the role of private and foreign investment. Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. Its opponents have blamed it for increased poverty, inequality and economic degradation. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet solved a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. There exists a lively debate in India as to <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> economic reforms sustainable.|$|E
25|$|While the Indian subcontinent has had invaders from Central Asia since ancient times, <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Muslim invasions {{different}} is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually {{in many cases}} superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was {{left to their own}} laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, different from ancient Indian culture. The overwhelming majority of Muslims in India were Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also {{played an important role in}} the synthesis of cultures.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E

[...] Todd had thought he had cured her, multiple times, but she still had episodes, and when she had to attend to a large farm in empty Vermont alone, she was pushed over the edge.

Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, sitting there in the editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement {{as it did in the}} episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> concept even funnier.|$|E
