500|$|Through 1915, the Armenian Genocide was {{underway}} in the Ottoman Empire. By {{the end of}} the war, virtually all Armenians living in their ancestral homeland were either dead or forced into exile by the Ottoman government. An estimated 1.5 million Armenians died in the process, ending two thousand years [...] of Armenian presence in Western Armenia. The only major resistance to the Turkish atrocities took place in Van. The Turkish army besieged the city but the local Armenians, under the leadership of Aram Manukian, kept them out until the Armenian volunteers reached Van, forcing the Turks to retreat. Andranik with his unit entered Van on 19 May 1915. Andranik subsequently helped the Russian army to take control of Shatakh, Moks and Tatvan on the southern shore of Lake Van. During the summer of 1915, the Armenian volunteer units disintegrated and Andranik went to Tiflis to recruit more volunteers and continued the combat from November 1915 until March 1916. With Andranik's support, the city of Mush was captured by Russians in February 1916. In recognition of lieutenant general Theodore G. Chernozubov, the successes of Russian army in numerous locations <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the fighting of the first Armenian battalion, headed by Andranik. Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief, who well understood the combat situation; Chernozubov described him as always at the head of militia, enjoying great prestige among the volunteers.|$|E

The authors reported that long periods of standing at work <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> atherosclerotic progression.

One-third of working-age black adults (more than 6 million people) were also uninsured or experienced a gap in coverage during the year. Blacks had the most problems with medical debt, with 61 percent of uninsured black adults reporting medical bill or debt problems, vs. 56 percent of whites and 35 percent of Hispanics.|$|E

5000|$|Gay {{and lesbian}} youth bear an {{increased}} risk of suicide, substance abuse, school problems, and isolation because of a [...] "hostile and condemning environment, verbal and physical abuse, rejection and isolation from family and peers". Further, LGBT youths are more likely to report psychological and physical abuse by parents or caretakers, and more sexual abuse. Suggested reasons for this disparity are that (1) LGBT youths may be specifically targeted {{on the basis of their}} perceived sexual orientation or gender non-conforming appearance, and (2) that [...] "risk factors associated with sexual minority status, including discrimination, invisibility, and rejection by family members...may lead to an increase in behaviors that are associated with risk for victimization, such as substance abuse, sex with multiple partners, or running away from home as a teenager." [...] A 2008 study showed a correlation between the degree of rejecting behavior by parents of LGB adolescents and negative health problems in the teenagers studied: Higher rates of family rejection <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> poorer health outcomes. On the basis of odds ratios, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide, 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression, 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs, and 3.4 times more likely to report having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection.|$|E

50|$|Later on, {{researchers}} connected motivational intensity {{to clinical}} applications {{and found that}} alcohol-related pictures caused narrowed attention for persons who had a strong motivation to consume alcohol. The researchers tested the participants by exposing them to alcohol and neutral pictures. After the picture was displayed on a screen, the participants finished a test evaluating attentional focus. The findings proved that exposure to alcohol-related pictures led to a narrowing of attentional focus to individuals who were motivated to use alcohol. However, exposure to neutral pictures did not correlate with alcohol-related motivation to manipulate attentional focus. The Alcohol Myopia Theory (AMT) states that alcohol consumption reduces {{the amount of information}} available in memory, which also narrows attention so only the most proximal items or striking sources are encompassed in attentional scope. This narrowed attention leads intoxicated persons to make more extreme decisions than they would when sober. Researchers provided evidence that substance-related stimuli capture the attention of individuals when they have high and intense motivation to consume the substance. Motivational intensity and cue-induced narrowing of attention has a unique role in shaping people’s initial decision to consume alcohol. In 2013, psychologists from the University of Missouri investigated the connection between sport achievement orientation and alcohol outcomes. They asked varsity athletes to complete a Sport Orientation Questionnaire which measured their sport-related achievement orientation on three scales—competitiveness, win orientation, and goal orientation. The participants also completed assessments of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. The results revealed that the goal orientation of the athletes <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> alcohol use but not alcohol-related problems.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2001 {{study that}} {{examined}} possible {{root causes of}} mental disorders in lesbian, gay and bisexual people, Cochran and psychologist Vickie M.

The authors found strong evidence of {{a relationship between the}} two. The team compared how 74 LGB and 2,844 heterosexual respondents rated lifetime and daily experiences with discrimination such as not being hired for a job or being denied a bank loan, as well as feelings of perceived discrimination. LGB respondents reported higher rates of perceived discrimination than heterosexuals in every category related to discrimination, the team found. According to the Journal of Addiction and Mental Health, around 600 people between the ages of 10 and 24 die each year from suicide and about 32% of these people are lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LAB) youth. [...] " [...] However, while gay youth are considered to be at higher risk for suicide, a literature review published in the journal Adolescence states, [...] "Being gay in-and-of-itself is not the cause of the increase in suicide." [...] Rather the review notes that the findings of previous studies suggested the,"...suicide attempts <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> psychosocial stressors, including gender nonconformity, early awareness of being gay, victimization, lack of support, school dropout, family problems, acquaintances' suicide attempts, homelessness, substance abuse, and other psychiatric disorders.

5000|$|Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality {{published}} {{a report in}} 2015 synthesizing research on juvenile justice system involvement of girls in the U.S. and articulated a cycle of systems-involvement, described as the [...] "Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline.” Prior to becoming involved in the juvenile justice system, {{there is evidence that}} girls experience higher rates of trauma and sexual abuse than systems-involved boys. [...] For example, in a study of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida, Baglivio et al. found that these offenders had experienced high numbers of “Adverse Childhood Experiences.” These experiences differed by gender. 31% of the girls in the study had experienced childhood sexual abuse, while only 7% of boys had. 45% of the girls and 24% of boys had experienced five or more Adverse Childhood experiences. Additionally, research has indicated that girls who experience trauma are more likely than boys to develop mental health conditions. Research has not established a causal link between trauma exposure and delinquent behavior, but has established a correlation. For example, research by Smith et al. on adolescent girls in Oregon’s juvenile justice system found that sexual abuse, but not physical abuse or lifetime trauma, <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> substance use. The differential rate of and response to trauma exposure by gender has therefore been identified as an explanation for the disproportionate entry of girls into the juvenile justice system. In this theory, behaviors that are coping mechanisms for trauma experienced by girls, such as alcohol and drug use, and status offenses such as running away from home or shoplifting, are criminalized, leading to their system involvement.|$|E
