5000|$|In an Old School - Back to the 80s {{interview}} from 2011, Decker was asked how the reformation {{of the band}} came to fruition. She replied [...] "I decided in 1998, after meeting a new manager, to start work again after years of no confidence. We toured [...] "Red", my fourth album, and put it out on my label Gnatfish. I would've loved to have gotten {{the same level of}} success again but it didn't happen although I did sell a lot of albums on the road. I was no longer bankrolled, so I couldn't get the PR and TV coverage which you so need." [...] In a 2013 interview for Super Deluxe Edition writer Paul Sinclair, Decker spoke of the album in relation to being a mother and touring commitments. [...] "I had an album out called [...] "Red" [...] in 1998 and I recorded that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> with my daughter, who is now 14. I toured it up and down the UK, and then I went across Europe with Status Quo and I left her behind when she was six months old. I sulked my way across Germany - it was just awful. I hadn’t been a mum before. Scarlett was incredibly healthy, my mother moved in to help look after her. I left her safe and sound and well sorted, but I didn’t take into consideration being a new mother, separated from her daughter after six months, with hormones raging… I was in bits. So consequently I haven’t toured, with a capital ‘t’, since then, which is where all these eighties shows have come in brilliantly." [...] T'Pau, including Rogers, would embark on a 28-date UK tour during the spring of 2013, to mark the 25th anniversary of the formation of the band.|$|E

Because they helped me, you know they took me under their wing and they’re like okay, well, let’s go, you know look at Section  8 (rental assistance to low-income families), let’s go do this, let’s go do that.

5000|$|The album's {{idea came}} when Thalía <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> {{with her first}} daughter, Sabrina Sakaë.

During a press conference on 17 June 2008 in New York City, where Thalía stated:"This album came along <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very <b>pregnant</b> with my daughter. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost eight months pregnant.

40|$|In the German artist, Rosemarie Trockel’s, (b. 1952) pencil drawing, The Wupper Country Club (1989), {{she draws}} a girl {{walking in the}} {{countryside}} uttering the words “We knit what we see!” I find myself now living in the countryside, rarely walking in it and not knitting what I see. I knit what I feel. Knitting is my way of interpreting, communicating and coming to terms with, {{the world that we}} inhabit. It sits between me and my internal world and the physical world around me like some form of knitted comfort blanket. Knitting has long held associations with practical function, the production of garments to keep us warm and comfortable. Like many people I have a desire to own functional, knitted works, but I have no desire to make them. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> I was continually being asked what I had been knitting my baby. I had knitted nothing. Guilt got the better of me and she received a jumper, then depression and she received some giant pram trousers. In 1999 I exhibited my series of Odd Sweaters, at the Crafts Council Gallery in London. These sweaters are not garments to be worn but to “visually discuss” ideas about normality and conformity. One visitor to the gallery remarked that it was “such a waste”. Our need to justify objects through function is great, but our actual needs aren’t. Who really needs another jumper, cushion yet alone tea-cosy? Most of us in western society have far more than we need. Function is a fiction in our desire to knit. However the emotional function of knitting is another matter all together. In this paper I will reflect upon my own knitted works and my use of knitting to explore and communicate my thoughts about perfection, death, motherhood, gender inequality and {{what it is to be}} human. Common issues explored through a common art...|$|E
40|$|My daughter’s school class-room {{assistant}} {{loves to}} knit. Last December {{she said that}} she had knitted my daughter a cardigan, as she knew that I never would. On Christmas Eve her husband delivered it, as he handed me the package he said two words, not “Happy Christmas” but “Bad mother”. The exhibition of my piece entitled Bad Mother (2013), after this doorstop encounter, elicited another surprising remark. A male visitor congratulated me on what he saw as a “very honest admission”. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> I was continually being asked what I had knitted my baby. As I was well known for my work with knitting it was assumed that I would be preparing a wonderful array of lovingly knitted items. In my studio I had knitted plenty of things but had knitted her nothing. Guilt eventually got the better of me and she received a jumper, then after her birth depression, and she received some giant pram trousers. The very mixed feelings, not all together positive that I had upon the birth of my daughter and becoming a mother, are expressed through my work IT SUCKS (2004). In this piece I subvert the traditional hand knitted Shetland Lace christening shawl by knitting the words IT SUCKS in lace holes at the centre of the shawl. My inability to accept the changes that motherhood necessitated in me was the catalyst behind, How to make a piece of work when you’re too tired to make decisions (2004). Determined not to change a thing about my life once I became a mother I had organised to undertake a residency in Berlin six months after the birth of my daughter. The idea for this work was conceived of whilst I was lying in bed at night, over tired but unable to sleep. During my sleepless nights I developed a process where all decisions were taken away from me, resting on the throw of a dice. In this paper I will discuss how I have used my practice as an artist to navigate the very mixed emotions that I have experienced as a mother. These tumultuous emotions and my identity as a mother have been the driving force behind an ongoing series of knitted works...|$|E
