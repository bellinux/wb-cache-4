5|$|Great auks <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> and {{sometimes}} used their wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear of human beings, and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened {{by the sight of}} something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
500|$|At half-time, the {{trainers}} found on Schulz [...] "a mass {{of black and}} blue spots". [...] His [...] "face was distorted with bumps", and there were [...] "welts {{on his back and}} groin". [...] As the second half started, Schulz insisted he felt better and went back into the game. [...] But the attack continued. [...] "Another scrimmage and two more Penn men were after him again. [...] He went into the play and for an instant, his strength came back, but it couldn't last, and it didn't.” [...] Yost finally sent in a substitute, and Schulz limped to the sideline and <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> away [...] "with head bowed and hands to his stomach". [...] And when the [...] "rubbers" [...] removed his togs and examined him, [...] "they marveled {{that he was able to}} walk". [...] In the end, Schulz [...] "didn't say a wordbig tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the firefighters}} {{appearing}} as extras in [...] "Subway" [...] were Baltimore firefighters. Yoshimura {{said that the}} firefighters {{who appeared to be}} running in the episode were actors, while the real firefighters <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> because, based on their real-life experience, they knew {{that there would be no}} need to rush in a situation involving a fatality. Although power on the railings were turned off during shooting, the crew and producers were not aware that some residual electricity continues to run through the cars even after the tracks have been shut down. At one point during the shooting, D'Onofrio felt a charge of that electricity run through him and said, [...] "I'm really feeling something strange here." [...] The crew initially believed D'Onofrio to be ad-libbing a line of dialogue in character, but eventually realized he was being electrified. When the MTA explained about the residual electricity, the crew installed rubber insulation so that D'Onofrio would not touch the metal of the train and experience any electricity. Fleder was impressed that D'Onofrio continued with the shoot, and said, [...] "Most actors I worked with would've left the set at that point." ...|$|E

2500|$|As his {{procession}} {{came along}} the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and fifth columnists who {{were unable to}} give themselves up.

While the battle began outside, he <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the FFI and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported; ...|$|E
2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I was just going to ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just like I have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{stepped from}} cover with his pistol drawn, saw Hale {{collapsed}} dead, and yelled to Stoudenmire {{that this was}} not his fight. [...] However, Constable Krempkau, mistakenly believing that Campbell had shot him, then fired his pistol twice at Campbell before losing consciousness from loss of blood. [...] Krempkau's first bullet struck Campbell's gun and broke his right wrist, while the second hit him in the foot. [...] Campbell screamed in pain and scooped up his gun from the ground with his left hand. [...] Stoudenmire whirled from Hale and instantly fired at Campbell who dropped his gun again, grabbed his stomach and collapsed onto the ground. [...] Stoudenmire <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> toward Campbell and coldly glared at him. [...] In agony, Campbell yelled, [...] "You big son of a bitch! You murdered me!" [...] Stoudenmire said nothing. [...] Both Campbell and Krempkau died within minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Trainer Keene Fitzpatrick {{walked onto}} the field to examine Curtis and quickly saw that the leg was broken. [...] In what the Detroit Free Press {{described}} as [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a football field," [...] the crowd of 1,000 sitting in the bleachers fell silent and Michigan's quarterback, Harry Workman, [...] "was seen {{to come out of}} the bunch of standing players, put his hands to his face, and break down and weep like a child." [...] A surgeon who was in the stands came onto the field, examined Curtis, and called for an ambulance. [...] The crowd sat silently as Curtis was [...] "carefully placed on a stretcher" [...] and into the hospital wagon. [...] As the crowd finally <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> up State Street, the [...] "gloom was awful." [...] The Detroit Free Press wrote:"Big Joe Curtis – one of the best fellows who ever went to college – who was acknowledged to be the best tackle in the west, and who was preparing himself to play the game of his life against Pennsylvania, the last college game in which he could ever participate, and who was practically certain of recognition for the All-American team, is down and out on the eve of what was to be the great climax of his spectacular football career[...] [...] [...] 'G-L-O-O-M' spells Ann Arbor tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|To the north, {{the leading}} brigade of the 31st Division {{advanced}} into no man's land before zero hour, ready to rush the German front trench when the barrage lifted. Some {{units of the}} 4th Division, advanced from the British front line in formations led by snipers and skirmishers; in the 29th Division some battalions [...] "marched" [...] to the German wire and others rushed forward from assembly-trenches dug in no man's land. In the 36th, 32nd and 8th division areas, some battalions assembled {{in front of the}} German wire, ready to rush forward at zero hour and many of the battalions of XV Corps and XIII Corps <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> forward in lines behind a creeping barrage. Of [...] in the initial attack, [...] into no man's land, ten rushed from the British front trench and twelve advanced at a steady pace behind a barrage. Prior and Wilson found that the behaviour of the British infantry had less effect than the behaviour of the German infantry, which in turn was determined by the fire of the British artillery. Where the German defences and garrisons had been destroyed, the British infantry succeeded. When significant numbers of German machine-gunners survived, especially when supported by artillery, the British attack failed. On the French front, the artillery preparation was almost wholly effective in destroying German defences and killing German infantry in their underground shelters. The prevalence and effectiveness of killing-machines determined the result and in such an environment, a soldier with a bayonet was obsolete and infantry formations irrelevant.|$|E

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, <b>walked</b> <b>slowly</b> to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E
