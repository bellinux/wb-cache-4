5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such strong feelings for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for <b>Will</b> <b>reflect</b> her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E

For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E
25|$|Light {{confined}} in a resonator <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> multiple times from the mirrors, {{and due to}} the effects of interference, only certain patterns and frequencies of radiation will be sustained by the resonator, with the others being suppressed by destructive interference.

25|$|Uber fares {{are based}} on a dynamic pricing model, in which fares are higher during periods of high demand for rides. The same route costs {{different}} amounts at different times as a result of factors such as the supply and demand for Uber drivers at the time the ride is requested. When rides are in high demand in a certain area and there are not enough drivers in such area, Uber fares increase to get more drivers to that area and to reduce demand for rides in that area. The rate quoted to the rider <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> such dynamic pricing.|$|E

25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. Home equity loans {{tend to be the}} most sensitive to changes in interest rates, while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{designated}} a stealth fighter, measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect. An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal {{the front of the}} jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept, so <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{a mirror}} {{is determined by the}} percentage of reflected light per the percentage of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but is a poor reflector of infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm. Gold is up to 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm (yellow). Silver has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal, and can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.|$|E

500|$|Without an {{electric}} charge, neutron beams cannot {{be controlled by}} the conventional electromagnetic methods employed for particle accelerators. The magnetic moment of the neutron allows some control of neutrons using magnetic fields, however, including the formation of polarized neutron beams. [...] One technique employs the fact that cold neutrons <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> from some magnetic materials at great efficiency when scattered at small grazing angles. [...] The reflection preferentially selects particular spin states, thus polarizing the neutrons. [...] Neutron magnetic mirrors and guides use this total internal reflection phenomena to control beams of slow neutrons.|$|E

She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy <b>will</b> <b>reflect</b> this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she will be just fine." ...|$|E
