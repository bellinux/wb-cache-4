40|$|We {{explain the}} recent {{events in the}} German market for online access using {{a model of a}} {{regulated}} monopoly renting phone lines to retailers. Retailers offer either a linear or a flat tariff to consumers. Consumer heterogeneity leads to adverse selectiion. We show why market entry for flatrate firms is difficult under a linear <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff.</b> With both a linear and a flat <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff</b> the consumer market shows a mixture of tariffs as well. When marginal costs are zero it is optimal to have a wholesale flatrate only. However, marginal moves towards this equilibrium are not always welfare improving.

40|$|Slotting {{allowances}} are fees paid by {{manufacturers to}} get access to retailers’ shelf space. Although the main attention towards slotting allowances has been within the grocery industry, slotting allowances have also been applied within e. g. e-commerce and mobile telephony. In these industries we observe that distributors have large market power due to their control of access to customers. We analyse how shifting bargaining power from manufacturers to retailers and the use of slotting allowances affect consumers’ surplus and channel profit when the manufacturer undertakes non-contractible retail sales effort (through e. g. advertising, promotions and product quality control). We show that with a simple linear <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff</b> consumers are better off if the retailer has the bargaining power than if it belongs to the manufacturer. With retail bargaining power a change from a linear <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff</b> to slotting allowances harms the consumers and increases channel profit. As a consequence, the welfare effects of slotting allowances are ambiguous...|$|E

Under discriminatory pricing, downstream firms that {{differ in their}} ex ante distribution of retail costs are offered different tariffs. Under uniform pricing, the same <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff</b> is offered to all downstream firms. In contrast to the extant literature on price discrimination with nonlinear wholesale tariffs, we find that banning discriminatory wholesale contracts often improves welfare. This also holds if the manufacturer is not an unconstrained monopolist. Moreover, uniform pricing increases downstream investments in cost reduction in the long run...|$|E

40|$|Two-part tariffs, {{when used}} at the retail level, {{increase}} efficiency by lowering the price of marginal units. The same potential for higher efficiency exists for two-part tariffs at wholesale level for a given market structure, but the fixed part of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariff</b> can negatively affect the latter. In a simulated competition model of next-generation telecommunications access networks that has been calibrated with engineering cost data, we show that the latter effects strongly outweigh the former. That is, substituting a cost-based linear wholesale access tariff with revenue-equivalent two-part tariffs reduces the number of access seekers and therefore leads to higher prices and lower welfare and consumer surplus. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{created a}} {{framework}} for competition in local telecommunications. Under its rules and {{under the jurisdiction of}} state regulatory authorities, competitive local telephone companies were to gain access to some or all parts of the incumbent's network through known <b>wholesale</b> <b>tariffs</b> and offer retail local telephone service. As customers adopt other technologies for communications–mobile wireless service, broadband for email, messaging, and information retrieval–additional competitive pressures are put on the core voice telephone market. The substitution of usage and access from local telephony to other modes of communication is regarded as intermodal competition and {{is the subject of this}} paper. This study concerns local telecommunications competition between incumbent and competitive service providers in the United States. In addition to measuring competition from within the wireline market, we find significant intermodal competitive impacts resulting from wireless and high-speed development. We report empirical results from an econometric model that measures line loss impacts between carriers and the effects of wireless and high-speed services on the wireline market. The paper offers interpretation of the strategic and policy implications of these results. Business Economics (2005) 40, 18 – 28; doi: 10. 2145 / 20050202...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{governments in}} many {{countries}} have acknowledged the higher complexity involved in finding the more efficient path towards a so-called broadband ecosystem. The governments of Australia and New Zealand are leading the deployment of national fibre-based broadband infrastructures through Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP). The paper is on the approach followed by New Zealand and Australia to developing Next-Generation broadband infrastructure, their broadband policies and strategies for network deployment. It also contributes an economic analysis that allows understanding the economics of those country-wide broadband platforms. The paper critically analyses the short history of each experience, including the political process, the reasons exhibited that justify the governments' involvement in infrastructure deployment, and the institutional arrangements introduced to manage the PPP. The paper's main goal is to contribute analytical tools {{to the understanding of}} the economic effects of a purpose-made infrastructure on the markets that, according to every government's declared expectation, will be propelled by the combined effect of policy decisions, regulations and technology deployment.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the joint {{position}} taken by nine academics on the French debate {{introduced by the}} “Rapport de la commission présidée par Paul Champsaur sur l’organisation du marché de l’électricité” on April 2009. In order to reform the French reform, the Champsaur commission has made three main recommendations: (i) withdrawing the current retail administered tariff for business (ii) maintaining retail administered tariffs for households (iii) introducing a <b>wholesale</b> administered <b>tariff</b> on electricity from nuclear power generation. This rapport invites discussions on the French market design. Our academic joint position challenges these propositions. The authors welcome to the fact the commission proposes to abandon the tariff for business as very complex to implement (and hence costly) and freezes competition. However, authors have reservations about the other two recommendations. They are mainly based on the classical two-prong economic test to support a new regulation: (i) assessing its costs and benefits to ensure the latter offsets the former; (ii) comparing the recommended regulation with alternative instruments to verify {{that it is the}} best choice.

Finally, we present some recommendations for designing autonomous broker agents. I...|$|R
30|$|By now, {{the pricing}} {{competition}} problem in decentralized supply chains, initiated in 1980 s [4, 5], {{has been well}} studied by both scholars and practitioners. Most of these researches on the pricing competition problem focus on the following four structures: monopoly common retailer structure [6 – 8], chain-to-chain structure [4, 9, 10], dual channel structure [11 – 14], and monopoly common manufacturer structure, which is studied in this paper. The research on the monopoly common manufacturer structure was initiated by Ingene and Parry [15], considering a coordination problem in a supply chain where a manufacturer sells its products through competing retailers. Ingene and Parry [16] demonstrated that the manufacturer can generally obtain more profits by setting a unique two-part <b>tariff</b> <b>wholesale</b> pricing policy. For pricing competition, Yang et al.[17] considered a pricing problem in a two-echelon supply chain with a manufacturer who supplies a single product to two competing retailers. Assuming that the manufacturer acts as a Stackelberg leader, they explored {{the effects of the}} retailers’ Bertrand and Collusion behaviors on the performance of the supply chain. Wu et al.[18] investigated the pricing decision in this monopoly common manufacturer channel structure and built six noncooperative models where the two retailers play Stackelberg or Bertrand games under three possible power structures. Besides, Huang et al.[19] considered a pricing competition and cooperation problem in a supply chain with one common manufacturer and duopoly retailers and explored the conditions under which the retailers can benefit from their collusion behaviors.|$|R

Variation in sectoral composition across districts and liberalization intensity across production sectors allows a difference-in-difference approach. Rural districts, in which production sectors more exposed to liberalization were concentrated, experienced slower decline in poverty and lower consumption growth. The impact of liberalization was most pronounced among the least geographically mobile, {{at the bottom of}} the income distribution, and in Indian states where inflexible labor laws impeded factor reallocation across sectors.
