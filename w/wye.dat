5|$|In 1949, the {{southern}} terminus of US 213 was {{cut back to}} US 50 in <b>Wye</b> Mills, with the former route between <b>Wye</b> Mills and Ocean City becoming an extension of US 50 from Annapolis over the newly completed Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The former routing of US 213 between <b>Wye</b> Mills and Ocean City is now US 50 between <b>Wye</b> Mills and Vienna, Old Route 50 through Vienna, US 50 between Vienna and Salisbury, US 50 Bus. through Salisbury, MD 346 between Salisbury and east of Berlin, and US 50 between east of Berlin and Ocean City. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved {{the elimination of the}} US 213 designation. US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in <b>Wye</b> Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill. In 1994, the at-grade intersection with US 301 was replaced with an interchange.|$|E
5|$|As {{hunting with}} beagles {{was seen as}} ideal for young people, many of the British public schools {{traditionally}} maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in <b>Wye,</b> Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, <b>Wye,</b> Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the station}} there is a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a <b>wye</b> that curves east from the yard towards Briarwood. A second side of the <b>wye</b> curves west to become {{a lower level of}} the subway just west {{of the station}}. The yard itself is situated just north of the station in the southern portion of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, between the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wye's</b> tributaries {{include the}} river Lugg, Elan, Dulas, Irfon, Marteg, Monnow, Trothy, Ithon, Llynfi, Letton Lake, Tarennig (the <b>Wye's</b> first tributary) and Bidno.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} a {{hub of the}} New York Central, Boston and Albany, and Rutland railroads, with three <b>wyes</b> and one roundhouse.|$|R
25|$|The paper {{industry}} was notable in 17th and 18th century High Wycombe. The <b>Wye's</b> waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. The {{paper industry}} was soon overtaken by the cloth industry.|$|R
5|$|MD 404 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 662 (Old <b>Wye</b> Mills Road) in <b>Wye</b> Mills {{on the border}} of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, heading to the east on Queen Anne's Highway, a two-lane undivided road. It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway). This intersection has park and ride lots on the northwest and northeast corners. From here, MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a two-lane road, approaching the town of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|Tintern Abbey in the <b>Wye</b> valley {{was founded}} for monks of the Cistercian order by Walter FitzRichard, lord of Netherwent and Striguil, on 9 May 1131.|$|E
5|$|As a Long Island Rail Road station {{it served}} as one of two {{junctions}} between the Far Rockaway and Rockaway Beach Branches. The other junction was at Hammels Station, although it was originally a junction for the Far Rockaway Branch and the Ocean Electric Railway. Hammels is now located where Hammels <b>Wye</b> is. Wooden shelter sheds {{were added to the}} station in 1921 and 1923. A fire on the trestle between this station and another one known as The Raunt, located to the north, forced the closure of both stations on May 23, 1950, as well as the entire Jamaica Bay trestle which stretches from Howard Beach to Hammels <b>Wye.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Trowbridge Diamond - CH 84.9 - the Plymouth Subdivision is crossed by the CN Flint Division (dual track) {{just west}} of the East Lansing Amtrak station on Harrison Road; there are no <b>wyes</b> for {{interchange}} ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wye's</b> Latin name is Vaga, an {{adjective}} meaning 'wandering'. The Tithe map references a Vagas Field in both Whitchurch and Chepstow. The modern Welsh name Gwy may {{be derived}} from old Welsh Gwybiol or Gwyr (crooked wandering hills).|$|R
50|$|Unlike tender locomotives, Garratts are bi-directional, which {{eliminates}} the need for turntables or triangles, also known as <b>wyes.</b> The fact that they {{did not need to be}} run through to terminals to be turned around also made increased operational flexibility possible.|$|R
5|$|MD 213 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 662 (<b>Wye</b> Mills Road) in <b>Wye</b> Mills, Queen Anne's County, {{heading to the}} north on College Drive, a two-lane undivided road. From the southern terminus, MD 213 is designated by the state as the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway. The road heads into rural farmland, passing Chesapeake College {{on the west side}} of the road before intersecting US 50 (Ocean Gateway). Past this intersection, MD 213 continues north on Centreville Road, passing more farms as well as some residences. The route continues into a mix of woods and farmland before intersecting the northern terminus of MD 309 (Starr Road). A short distance later, the route interchanges with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway).|$|E
5|$|MD 404 was {{designated}} by 1933 {{to run from}} Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to <b>Wye</b> Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to <b>Wye</b> Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh border {{situation}} remained unsettled however, and in {{the decades}} after 1250 security grew significantly worse, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd conducted numerous raids into English territories. The <b>Wye</b> valley and Goodrich were particularly affected by these raids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wye's</b> hobbies include astronomy. He has a home {{observatory}} with a 16 inch (~400 mm) Schmitt Cassegrain computerised telescope. He {{has a large}} {{collection of}} antique flutes, both the western concert variety and other kinds. He demonstrates about 60 of them in his Carnival Show.|$|R
50|$|A balloon loop was {{installed}} at Papanui in August 1922 so rakes of trailers {{could be turned}} without holding up traffic by shunting them in a loop on the road. This {{was to be the}} first in Christchurch, predating the many <b>wyes</b> and loops that were later installed to facilitate the operation of one-man trams.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{considerations}} {{apply to}} the use of triangular junctions and reversing <b>wyes</b> on streetcar and tram systems, as apply to mainline rail systems. Many, although by no means all, streetcar and tram systems use single ended vehicles that have doors on one side only, and that must be turned {{at each end of the}} route.|$|R
5|$|The first {{border between}} Wales and England was zonal, apart {{from around the}} River <b>Wye,</b> {{which was the first}} {{accepted}} boundary. Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching {{from the mouth of the}} Dee to the mouth of the <b>Wye.</b> Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{initially}} designated as US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established, running from Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The highway was rerouted {{to cross the}} Nanticoke River in Vienna by 1933, with the former route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado becoming a part of MD 313 and the alignment between Eldorado and Rhodesdale becoming part of MD 14. US 213 was rerouted to use the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge over the Choptank River in Cambridge in 1939; the former alignment between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Meanwhile, the road between Elkton and the Pennsylvania border became MD 280. US 213 was moved to a bypass of Easton and straight alignment between Easton and <b>Wye</b> Mills in 1948. A year later, the southern terminus was cut back to US 50 in <b>Wye</b> Mills, with an extended US 50 replacing US 213 between <b>Wye</b> Mills and Ocean City. In 1971, US 213 and MD 280 were decommissioned and replaced with MD 213.|$|E
5|$|At its west end, US 50 was {{extended}} south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and {{west to the}} San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580, but remained on maps and signs for several more years. US 50 {{was extended}} east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three {{years prior to the}} opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and <b>Wye</b> Mills and U.S. Route 213 between <b>Wye</b> Mills and Ocean City. Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.|$|E
50|$|The Fitzgerald Subdivision is a {{railroad}} line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Georgia. The line runs from Manchester to Waycross {{for a total}} of 201.6 miles. At its north end it continues south from the Manchester Subdivision and at its south end it <b>wyes</b> off to the Thomasville Subdivision and the Jesup Subdivision.|$|R
50|$|The Kingsland Subdivision is a {{railroad}} line owned by CSX Transportation {{and operated by}} First Coast Railroad in the U.S. states of Florida and Georgia. The line runs from Jacksonville, Florida to Woodbine, Georgia {{for a total of}} 41.0 miles. At its south end it <b>wye's</b> off of the Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision and at its north end the track comes to an end.|$|R
50|$|A grand {{union is}} a rail track {{junction}} where two double-track railway lines cross at grade, {{often in a}} street intersection or crossroads. A total of sixteen railroad switches (sets of points) allow streetcars (or in more rare installations, trains) coming from any direction to take {{any of the three}} other directions. The same effect may be achieved with two consequent <b>wyes</b> if the location allows for space.|$|R
5|$|Because of its {{location}} watersports are {{a feature of}} the local scene. Clevedon Canoe Club is based at the marine lake and facilitates sea paddling trips along the North Somerset coast on the Severn Estuary, and to other sites such as the <b>Wye</b> Valley and Woolacombe. Nearby is based the Clevedon Sailing Club.|$|E
5|$|East of Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike, another flying {{junction}} {{ties the}} eastward tracks to Jamaica Yard. The {{other side of}} the <b>wye</b> curves west to become a lower level of the subway just west of Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike. After passing through 75th Avenue, those tracks join the local and express tracks at another flying junction.|$|E
5|$|East of US 50, MD 404 {{serves as}} part of the main route {{connecting}} the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area to the Delaware Beaches. MD 404 {{is a part of the}} main National Highway System for its entire length except for the portion from MD 662 to US 50 in <b>Wye</b> Mills.|$|E
50|$|The Seth Subdivision is a {{railroad}} line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of West Virginia. It was formerly {{part of the}} CSX Huntington East Division. It {{become part of the}} CSX Florence Division on June 20, 2016. The line runs from Seth, WV to Prenter, WV for a total of 10.2 miles. At its north end the line <b>wye's</b> off of the Big Coal Subdivision and at its south end the track comes to an end.|$|R
5000|$|The Steamtown Special History Study {{recommended}} that this locomotive remain at Steamtown {{because it is}} the only articulated locomotive in the Steamtown USA collection and {{recommended that}} due to its good condition, 4012 could be restored to working order. However, the study also recommended that 4012 remain on static display, because it is doubtful that the [...] "track, switches, culverts, trestles, bridges, <b>wyes,</b> turntables, and other facilities that would have to carry her could bear her great weight".|$|R
50|$|The Rupert Subdivision is a {{railroad}} line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of West Virginia. It was formerly {{part of the}} CSX Huntington East Division. It {{become part of the}} CSX Florence Division on June 20, 2016. The line runs from Rainelle, West Virginia to Clearco, West Virginia for a total of 20.8 miles. At its west end the track <b>wye's</b> off of the Sewell Valley Subdivision and at its east end the track comes to an end.|$|R
5|$|In October 2016, the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) {{took over}} {{management}} of the station from the MBTA under a lease agreement. The agreement relieves the MBTA from the cost of maintaining the station, while allowing the MWRTA to use parking revenue to construct bus shelters and additional parking areas. An additional parking lot was opened inside the <b>wye</b> {{on the north side}} of the station in August 2017.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Israel. Palestinian-Israeli {{relations}} grew even more hostile {{as a result}} of continued conflict. Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood. In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet. The resulting <b>Wye</b> River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, <b>Wye</b> Road {{followed}} the alignment of present-day 76Avenue out of Edmonton to the east, enroute to North Cooking Lake. By the 1920s {{it had become}} a secondary unsurfaced thoroughfare, and was later named Highway 14. As Edmonton and the newly developed Sherwood Park grew in the late 1960s, a free-flowing road, Sherwood Park Freeway, was built to link the two on a new alignment of Highway14 several hundred meters north of <b>Wye</b> Road. The cloverleaf interchange at the freeway's east end was completed in 1965, and the remaining interchanges were completed in 1968. It was four lanes wide and included an additional interchange immediately east of 17Street that has since been removed. After completion of Sherwood Park Freeway, the existing Highway14 (76Avenue) was renamed to Highway14A. Further south, Whitemud Drive was constructed and eventually extended east to reach Highway14. It then assumed the designation of Highway14 to a new terminus at Calgary Trail. The Highway14A designation has since been removed from 76Avenue, and the portion of Sherwood Park Freeway within Strathcona County was eventually renumbered Highway100.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{although}} some use {{was made of}} bi-directional tank locomotives and push-pull trains, most steam locomotives were uni-directional. Because of land usage considerations, turntables were normally used to turn such locomotives, and most terminal stations and locomotive depots were so equipped. Over time, most diesel and electric locomotives ordered in Europe {{have been designed to}} be fully bi-directional, symmetrical, and normally with two driving cabs. Thus most turntables and, where they existed, rail <b>wyes,</b> have been taken out of use.|$|R
25|$|Garratts {{have several}} {{advantages}} when used on light and narrow gauge railways. They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or <b>wyes.</b> They {{do not need to be}} run through to terminals, increasing operational flexibility. Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and they can run over bridges or line sections that might not be able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|R
