5|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was also the prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians.|$|E
5|$|He {{was part}} of the England squad that reached fourth place in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where he famously cried after {{receiving}} a yellow card in the semi-final with West Germany, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would have been suspended for the final itself had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, scoring a goal against Scotland which was described {{as one of the best}} of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{majored in}} chemistry, but Harvard {{required}} science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated summa cum laude in three years.|$|E
60|$|The Indian {{uttered a}} sound, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> did not understand.|$|R

5|$|South Melbourne and the VFL {{objected to}} the {{transfer}} and South Melbourne sent out a public appeal for a job for Nash that would match that offered by Camberwell but nothing suitable was forthcoming. There were also threats of legal action against Nash and Camberwell, which did not eventuate, although for playing in another competition without a clearance, Nash was banned from playing in the VFL competition for three years – a suspension <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would have to sit out of all football (both VFA and VFL) for three years if he wished to return from the VFA to the VFL.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{managed to}} qualify to the European U21 Championship in Czech Republic {{for the first}} time since 2004 after a {{successful}} qualification. In an exhibition game against Portugal U21 in early 2013, Augustinsson injured his knee and was later out for the rest of the year, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> missed most of the qualification games. He was however Håkan Ericson's first choice at the left-back position when he was available and was part of the squad in the games of 2014.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a barrage of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was eliminated due to a failure in communication, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> did not have enough time left for another fast lap {{at the end of the}} session. With the track still damp when qualifying began, times improved with every passing lap, with the drivers being able to switch from intermediate to slick tyres at the end of the first session. While the two Manor drivers once again qualified at the end of the grid, Jenson Button was also eliminated in Q1, leaving him with time penalties in the race, not being able to take the full extent of his 25-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū's {{consecutive}} basho streak {{came to an}} end in January 2006, when ōzeki Tochiazuma {{took the}} first tournament championship of the year. Asashōryū's performance in January was a surprisingly poor 11–4 but he successfully rebounded by winning the March tournament. However, his six losses in those tournaments matched his loss total for all of 2005. In the May tournament, he sustained an injury to the ligaments in his elbow on the second day falling out of the ring in a surprising loss to Wakanosato and was visibly slow to rise from the ground. He was absent from the tournament the next day and later released a statement confirming he was withdrawing from the tournament. Doctors told him {{he would not be able}} to compete for two months, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would miss the July tournament as well. However, Asashōryū was ready by the start of the July tournament and won with a 14–1 record. In the following tournament, Asashōryū won his eighteenth career title with a 13–2 record. He also won the final tournament of 2006 for his nineteenth career title, the fifth he has won with a perfect 15–0 record.|$|E

50|$|Two years later, Berntsen was {{nominated}} and elected {{vice president of}} the Football Association of Norway <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> had to quit his position at Viking.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into his garage and became the race's first retirement with accident damage on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into his garage where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from his garage by his team but drove slowly around the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} five-year deal, meaning {{that he would}} be 40 when his {{contract}} expired. Given made his Villa debut in a pre-season friendly victory over Walsall on 21 July. He was substituted at half time for Andy Marshall, when the score was 2–0 to Villa. Given kept a clean sheet on 27 July 2011 in the 2011 Barclays Asia Trophy in Hong Kong in which Aston Villa beat Blackburn Rovers 1–0. On 13 August 2011, Given played his first Premier League match for Aston Villa. They played Fulham in a 0–0 draw <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> kept his first clean sheet for Aston Villa in his first start for them. In September 2011, Given was reunited with Terry Gennoe at Aston Villa. After four years out of the game, Gennoe was named as the new first team goalkeeping coach, replacing Rafa González. He had previously coached Given at Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. On 3 December, Given suffered a torn hamstring, which sidelined him until January.|$|E
5|$|He {{would go}} on to score 23 times for Wales, {{including}} a hat-trick against Belgium in 1949 and braces against England (twice), Portugal, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. He won his final cap on 20 October 1950, scoring in a 2–2 draw with Scotland. His total of 23 goals was a record for Wales at the time before being equaled by Ivor Allchurch and eventually surpassed by Ian Rush and Gareth Bale. However, Ford's tally of 38 caps during his career was significantly lower than either Rush or Allchurch, who gained 73 and 68 caps respectively. In 1958, Wales qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first, and to date only time in their history but Ford was serving his suspension from the British game <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was overlooked for selection and {{was not included in the}} Welsh squad for the 1958 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
5|$|Ingham was capped {{once for}} Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only {{appearance}} in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career {{at this level}} concluded with four caps. Ingham was called into the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was called into the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a finger in training in June, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> missed out on making his debut.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
50|$|After {{losing a}} libel action {{regarding}} a satirical cartoon, Deputy Pitman was declared bankrupt in January 2013, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> automatically lost {{his seat in}} the Assembly of the States of Jersey.|$|R

50|$|In 1961, Baker was {{transferred}} to Torino for £75,000, after the Hibs board refused {{to give him a}} £5 wage increase from his existing wage of £12 a week. Despite scoring a winning goal in a Turin derby match against Juventus, his time at the Italian club was short and almost ended in tragedy. Baker was involved in a serious car crash, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> needed life-saving surgery and spent over a month on a drip feed. It was a generally unhappy spell as Baker did not like the press intrusion, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> and teammate Denis Law spent most of their time in their Turin apartment.|$|R
5|$|On 28 March 2017, Messi was {{suspended}} for four international games for insulting an assistant referee {{in a game against}} Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000. On 5 May 2017, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers. Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup {{for the first time since}} 1970. On 10 October 2017, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001. Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem <b>which</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
