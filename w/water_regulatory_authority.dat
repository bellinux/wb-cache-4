50|$|The Alexandria Water Company (AWCO) is {{the water}} {{company of the}} city and the {{governorate}} (province) of Alexandria, Egypt. It was founded in 1860 as a private company and it operated as such for more than 100 years before it was nationalized under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser. At that time it became the Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA), a department of Alexandria Governorate in charge of both water supply and sewerage. In 2004, through a country-wide sector reform it became a commercially oriented company under private law. The sewerage and wastewater treatment functions were transferred to a separate company, the Alexandria General Organization for Sanitary Drainage (AGOSD), later renamed to Alexandria Sanitary and Drainage Company (ASDCO). The water utility became a company under private law, reverted to its old name AWCO and gained some operational independence. Both AWCO and ASDCO are part of the government-owned Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, which owns all utilities in Egypt. AWCO serves 4.5 million inhabitants, a number that increases to 6 million during the summer season. The Alexandria water utility is one of the better-performing water service providers in Egypt, ranked fifth among 22 water utilities by the Egyptian <b>Water</b> <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Authority</b> in 2012/13.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to show the merits of using {{qualitative}} data on women’s experiences in the implementation and evaluation of emancipatory policies. Emancipation is a process which involves {{a lot of different}} aspects ranging from patriarchal rule, gendered divisions, power, agency and politics. Feminist scholarship tries to show all these different axes concerning the emancipation process, and women’s experiences {{play an important role in}} this discourse. The inclusion of women’s personal experiences in the form of qualitative data is not common practice as part of the official statistics on which policies are based upon. Even though the use of this data has great political relevance, the Dutch government unfortunately does not use this information for further development of the Dutch emancipation policy. Therefore this thesis is mainly based upon my internship done at the Dutch Women's Council in The Hague. For this internship I interviewed 23 women about their experiences during their candidacy for the <b>water</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> elections in the year of 2008. Following the gathered information from my informants, a connection is made between the Dutch emancipation policy and the measures taken to include women more fully within the employment sector. This connection will be explained first while clarifying the main research question of this thesis. To make this discussion on the Dutch emancipation policy more visual, a case study is incorporated which explains the Dutch <b>water</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities.</b> This governmental sector, as we will see later on, shows a lot of aspects which are presumed to work as barriers for women who want to work in higher functions. Based upon the information gathered from my female informants, structural barriers as well as so called “hidden gate keeping” mechanisms will be discussed to show that the <b>water</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> is a highly gender stratified organization. Structural barriers which women can face are the often mentioned lack of good maternity leave and child care until late working and meeting hours. “Hidden gate keeping” mechanisms focuses more upon the underlying stereotypical ideas about women and men, femininity and masculinity. To further uncover how these stereotypical ideas influence the relational sphere on the work floor, the network theory and the theory of tokenism will be discussed. In the last part of this thesis, a comparison is made between the Dutch welfare model and the Nordic (or Scandinavian) model, which is known for its high level of participation of women in the labor force. Because the welfare systems of both countries are largely similar, the question arises whether we can learn from, or perhaps even utilize, (parts of) the model used by these Nordic countries. By discussing the main principles of this Nordic model, I will argue that even though at first hand this model seems the answer to our problem, there are negative aspects to be found. Even though the model has been described as family friendly and beneficial to women, feminist scholarship has pointed out some negative aspects that we also need to take into consideration. Just as is the case with the Dutch welfare model, the Nordic model also stays entangled within a patriarchal discourse still present in the different Nordic countries. Even though there are pitfalls in this model, there are elements which could be useful for Dutch policy...|$|R

Management {{of water}} {{resources}} - demand for water {{in the country is}} outstripping supply, leading to serious water shortages and unsustainable drawal of ground water {{in many parts of the}} country. Whereas we increase the amount of water that is effectively available, the real solution lies in increasing the efficiency of water use. At present, almost 80% of our water is used in agriculture, and it is used very inefficiently. Water use in agriculture can be cut to half with known technology, e.g., by switching from flood irrigation of paddy to SRI. Water availability can be improved by treating sewage water before it enters our fresh water system. At present, only about 30% of sewage water is treated. There are similar problems with industrial effluents. With urbanisation and industrialisation set to accelerate, these pressures on our fresh water systems will increase. Corrective action in all these areas lies largely in the domain of state governments. The Approach paper called for a comprehensive re-examination of water policy including changes in the laws. It also calls for empowered <b>water</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>authorities</b> which can ensure effective allocation of water to different uses and also different areas. Some States have introduced innovative schemes for rational use of water by involving farmers actively. Future assistance under AIBP should be linked to moves which ensure more rational use of water.|$|R

The study involved 61 respondents including (households, charcoal venders and forest officer). Questionnaire survey, interview and documentary review methods were employed in data collection. A quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20 th version). While qualitative information was analyzed using content analysis. The study findings show that majority 56 (92 %) of the respondents reported that there is high rate of deforestation which was mainly contributed by charcoal production in the study area. The study further revealed that the observed high rate of deforestation affect the availability and supply of charcoal for domestic use. The scarcity of charcoal coupled with high and fluctuating price give the evidence on presence domestic energy crisis in the study area. Along with other recommendations, the study recommends that the Government Regulator (Energy and <b>Water</b> Utilities <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Authorities</b> - EWURA) should consider reducing tariff on other sources of energy particularly gas and electricity to allow many people afford and resorting to alternative energies for their domestic use and hence reduce the extent of deforestation...|$|R
