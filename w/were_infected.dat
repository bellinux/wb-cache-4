5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with the beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae {{into the central}} nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, an {{estimated}} 350 million individuals <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> worldwide. National and regional prevalences range from over 10% in Asia to under 0.5% in the United States and Northern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Forigners {{found to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with AIDS/HIV <b>are</b> deported, but Kuwaiti {{citizens}} who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>are</b> entitled to out patient medical care, organized by a specialised infectious disease hospital.|$|R

50|$|On June 10, a Norwegian {{man from}} Vest-Agder was {{confirmed}} to <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with swine influenza. Although {{he had not}} <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> abroad, he had been living with {{a person who had}} <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> abroad. This <b>was</b> the first domestic infection and was the 12th case of swine influenza in Norway.|$|R
5|$|In the US, 58% of the {{population}} is infected with HSV-1 and 16% are infected with HSV-2. Among those HSV-2-seropositive, only 19% were aware they <b>were</b> <b>infected.</b> During 2005–2008, the prevalence of HSV-2 was 39% in blacks and 21% in women.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{transmission}} {{is an unusual}} route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
50|$|FIV and HIV {{are both}} lentiviruses. However, humans cannot <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by FIV, nor can cats <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by HIV. FIV is {{transmitted}} primarily through saliva (bites), {{such as those}} incurred during territorial battles between males. Cats housed exclusively indoors are {{much less likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected,</b> provided they do not come in contact with infected cats.|$|R
25|$|Most {{people who}} <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> {{with only a}} small number of worms have no symptoms. It is common to find that most people <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> by a small number of worms, while a small number of people <b>are</b> heavily <b>infected,</b> {{something}} that <b>is</b> characteristic of many worm infections.|$|R
40|$|Almost one {{in every}} {{two people in the}} {{developing}} world <b>is</b> <b>infected</b> with one or more types of intestinal nematode worms. When fewer than 50 % of people <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> most carry only a few worms; but when more than 50 % <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> the number carrying moderate to heavy numbers increases markedly, as does the risk of disease. The WHO recommends annual mass deworming of children when 20 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> and twice a year if 50 % or more <b>are</b> <b>infected.</b> We estimated the cost of this to treat children with 10 + worms, an arbitrary moderate to heavy infection. We concluded that it is not cost-effective to mass treat children when fewer than 40 % <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> because the majority are uninfected and few are likely be diseased. We propose annual treatment when 40 % or more children <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> twice a year at 60 %, and three times a year at 80 % or more. This would cost USD 224 million annually to treat all children aged 2 – 14 years in 107 developing countries compared with USD 276 million using current WHO guidelines. The new three-tier guidelines also treat a larger proportion of infected children and treat children with moderate to heavy worm burdens more often...|$|R
5|$|Marsh rice rats from Paynes Prairie, Alachua County; Cedar Key, Levy County; and Lake Istokpoga, Highlands County, all in Florida, {{have yielded}} A.forresteri. In Paynes Prairie, the type locality, 82 of 178 animals {{examined}} <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with 1 to 50 (average 10) worms, but in Cedar Key {{only a single}} rat contained one worm. The worms {{were found in the}} front part, or fundus, of the stomach, with their front ends in the fundal tissue and their back ends projecting into the inside.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E
5|$|The LHQ Medical Research Unit used human test subjects, all volunteers {{drawn from}} the Australian Army, {{including}} a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical Research Unit researched quinine, sulphonamides, atebrin, plasmoquine, and paludrine.|$|E

5|$|The global {{mortality}} rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% {{of those who}} <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> died. With {{about a third of}} the world population infected, this case-fatality ratio means 3% to 6% of the entire global population died. Influenza may have killed as many as 25million people in its first 25 weeks. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while current estimates say 50–100million people worldwide were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{rates of}} either HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are between 60 and 95% in adults. HSV-1 {{is more common}} than HSV-2, with rates of both {{increasing}} as people age. HSV-1 rates are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. An estimated 536 million people or 16% of the population worldwide <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and in those in the developing world. Rates of infection {{are determined by the}} presence of antibodies against either viral species.|$|E
50|$|This change occurs {{simply because}} there are now fewer {{susceptibles}} in the population who can <b>be</b> <b>infected.</b> Rq <b>is</b> simply R0 minus those that would normally <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> but that cannot be now since they are immune.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{species has}} {{specific}} effect and causes symptoms {{in people who}} <b>are</b> <b>infected.</b> Some, if not most people who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with a pathogenic bacteria do not have symptoms.

3000|$|... (A 3) A {{susceptible}} vector can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> only by {{an infected}} plant host, and after it <b>is</b> <b>infected,</b> it {{will hold the}} virus {{for the rest of}} its life. Further, there is no vertical infection being considered.|$|R
5|$|Koalas {{have few}} predators; dingos and large pythons may prey on them, while {{birds of prey}} (such as {{powerful}} owls and wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external parasites, other than ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer mange from the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and skin ulcers from the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, but neither is common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless. These include the tapeworm Bertiella obesa, commonly found in the intestine, and the nematodes Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and Durikainema phascolarcti, which are infrequently found in the lungs. In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> {{with at least one}} species of the parasitic protozoal genus Trypanosoma, the most common of which was T.irwini.|$|E
5|$|Many men <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with malaria, and the {{regiment}} was periodically rotated {{away from the}} valley bottom to the western hills. Their first move back west was on the 16 May, when they moved to the brigade camp site near Talaat Ed Dumm, remaining there for the next thirteen days. On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, {{to the south of}} Bethlehem. On 14 June {{the regiment}} returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|By October26, the Government of the Union of Myanmar {{had begun}} distributing 60,000 zinc roof sheets and the Ministry of Forestry {{provided}} 200tonnes (220tons) of timber. Through {{the end of}} October, six non-governmental organizations in Myanmar planned to distribute emergency food supplies, such rice, oil, salt and pulses, to 5,000 residents in Kyaukpyu and Myebon. Health supplies were also being distributed at relief camps by UNICEF in the hardest-hit areas. About 500 family kits containing non-food items, such as tarpaulins and mosquito nets, had been distributed by the Myanmar Red Cross Society and another 1,200 were {{being sent to the}} area. By the start of November, the government of Myanmar requested medial aid from the United Nations as a cholera outbreak began to unfold. Additional post-storm diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, eye infections and skin diseases became prevalent as well. According to locals, at least six people {{died as a result of}} cholera. At least 200 people <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with dysentery and four were killed by the disease in the towns of Kyaukphyu, Minbya and Myebon. The cause of the outbreak was linked to a lack of clean water.|$|E
50|$|On June 13, a Norwegian {{woman from}} Rogaland was {{confirmed}} to <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with swine influenza. She {{had recently been}} to the United States and <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> there. This <b>was</b> the 15th case of swine influenza in Norway.|$|R
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{humans and}} water fleas (Cyclops) {{were regarded as}} the only animals this parasite <b>infects.</b> It has <b>been</b> shown that baboons, cats, dogs, frogs and catfish (Synodontis) can also <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> naturally.

5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
