60|$|I {{walked him}} rapidly {{out of the}} still square, past the fishermen's almshouses, towards the coast, he still inquiring indignantly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, sir," [...] said I, [...] "if <b>I</b> knew <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> or {{what was}} likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean {{is a good place}} indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been {{anywhere}} else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> <b>I</b> would go with a good will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In heaven's name," [...] said I, firing {{in spite}} of myself, [...] "what does it matter to you <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going?</b> Leave that teapot alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only {{trouble is}} that I chose to go away this morning without telling him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> Then <b>I</b> owned {{one-half}} of the wood-lot, with all there is or may be on it, and since {{it was the last}} time I should have the right to do anything regarding it without his knowledge, I refused to tell him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> But now that he owns an equal share with you, Mr. Simpson and me, he will have a perfect right to question me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because--I {{want to know}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> myself. Wherever you go, I {{have reason}} to believe, I shall find that I happen to be going also." ...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first part is the theoretical one, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> to introduce basic models of Islamic finance and banking. Assess {{the pros and cons}} of these models and the whole Islamic finance and banking industry. I will make a review of its history and find out reasons that have led to its creation. The second part is the practical one <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> to find connections between the theoretical issues and data from the qualitative research method (in form of interviews with managers of Islamic banks...|$|R
60|$|I went to {{the stable}} and {{harnessed}} the horse to the little carriage. Jonas was not there, and I {{had fallen out of}} the habit of calling him. I drove slowly through the yard and out of the gate. No one called to me or asked <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> How different this was from the old times! Then, some one would not have failed to know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> and, in all probability, she would have gone with me. But now I drove away, quietly and undisturbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] Kendricks suggested. [...] "We shan't get a {{table at}} all at the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> {{to take you to}} dine, unless we are punctual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Don’t ask me!” cried Mrs Verloc with a shuddering, {{repressed}} violence. All {{her strong}} vitality recoiled {{from the idea}} of death. “Never mind <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> [...] .” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will teach}} me {{to be careful of}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> after this," [...] he declared. [...] "Why, that bog looked almost as safe as the ground over here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't cry, darling. If I am spared I shall {{come back}} to you within three years. Perhaps I will write before then; but there are not many post-offices <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> to!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> now!" [...] said Lucinda. By {{which it}} may be feared that she {{indicated}} a place to which she should not on such an occasion have made an allusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{shall have}} {{his chance to}} reform in the brig," [...] said Jasper, with a laugh. [...] "There will be no temptations either to drink or steal <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> to this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} would dare do me any bodily injury," [...] I replied. [...] "He would know I had told some one <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> and that my absence would be noticed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they leave}} me here all night I'll be frozen stiff," [...] he thought, grimly. [...] "Oh, why didn't I tell Roger and Phil <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going!</b> They {{might come to}} the rescue!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} mean?" [...] thought Margery; {{but she did}} not stop to consider. [...] "Thank you very much," [...] she said. [...] "Here is <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> to eat, and nobody will disturb me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{shall be}} with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going,</b> you cannot come, so now I say same to you" [...] (John 13:33) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, I do, my friend. You go {{too fast}} with your conclusions. Now see to my valise, {{and on my}} return perhaps I'll tell you <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going,</b> and put your {{fidelity}} to the test." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Broadwing the Hawk {{tried to}} catch me," [...] sobbed Redcoat. [...] "In dodging him among the trees I was heedless {{for a moment and}} did not see just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> <b>I</b> struck a sharp-pointed dead twig and drove it right through my right wing." ...|$|R
60|$|I shall remain {{here about}} ten days for certain. If you have leisure and {{inclination}} in that time, write; if not, I will write to you <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going,</b> or at all events whither I am gone.|$|R
30|$|On day one I {{had no clue}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> with this, but I {{just did}} not want to quit. I had been in another golf {{equipment}} company that went broke, but I couldn’t bear to walk away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear of that. The {{first thing}} {{he said when he}} could speak was 'Tell Rose carefully,' and as I came away he guessed <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> and tried to kiss his hand in the old way, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad {{if you could}} tell me of some little place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could put up in Brussels; some place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could stay while looking out for work, without anyone troubling {{themselves}} as to whence <b>I</b> came or <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going,</b> or what are my views as to religion or politics." ...|$|R
60|$|Before I {{got to the}} shop, I met Mr. Batterbury {{taking his}} walking exercise. He stopped, shook hands with me affectionately, and asked <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going.</b> A {{wonderful}} idea struck me. Instead of answering his question, I asked after Lady Malkinshaw.|$|R
6000|$|Judith smiled that {{beautiful}} smile again. [...] "Ah, Miss Sophy, {{you have been}} very good, and helped me ever so much; but my time is nearly over, and I shall not want even you and madam <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going.</b> <b>I</b> shall see His face," [...] she murmured; and lifted up her hands.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the hall}} I met Quincey Morris, with a {{telegram}} for Arthur {{telling him that}} Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better, and that Van Helsing and I were with her. <b>I</b> told him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> and he hurried me out, but as <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> 'm <b>going</b> to," [...] said Betty, piling {{the dolls}} into her apron with more haste than care. [...] "I'm going right {{straight}} home to tell Ma all about it. I don't like such actions, and I 'm afraid to stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} be back till late, {{possibly}} not until to-morrow I do not tell you <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am <b>going,</b> in order {{that if you are}} asked you may be able truly to reply that I said nothing before I mounted, as to my destination." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I dropped Hassett in a Shield {{match at}} home in 1947 off spinner Mick Raymer before the perky little Victorian had scored. Lindsay said 'Ta' and thrashed 200. <b>Where</b> was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to get a double century to compensate? My two innings in that match totalled seven runs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>where</b> am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to find thirty {{thousand}} pounds {{to take up}} a bundle of mortgages which will probably never pay a farthing of interest? Why, I have not got three thousand that I can come at. Besides," [...] he added, recollecting himself, [...] "why should I interfere?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{summed up}} his {{philosophy}} {{in a speech}} at the 80th anniversary celebration of Grace United Church in Weyburn, Saskatchewan: [...] "We are moulded into a materialist world where {{we do a lot of}} eating, drinking and making merry until we ask the basic questions 'Who am <b>I?</b> <b>Where</b> am <b>I</b> <b>going?</b> What is our purpose in life?'".|$|R
6000|$|I wore a fur great-coat at that time, {{and before}} we were well clear of the wharf, he {{questioned}} me concerning it, and its price, and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> bought it, and when, and what fur it was, and what it weighed, and what it cost. Then he took notice of my watch, and asked me what THAT cost, and {{whether it was a}} French watch, and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> got it, and how I got it, and whether I bought it or had it given me, and how it went, and where the key-hole was, and when I wound it, every night or every morning, and whether I ever forgot to wind it at all, and if I did, what then? <b>Where</b> had <b>I</b> been to last, and <b>where</b> was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> next, and <b>where</b> was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> after that, and had I seen the President, and what did he say, and what did I say, and what did he say when I had said that? Eh? Lor now! do tell! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that even then the Duke would not, or could not, understand. His brows were knitted into a heavy frown, and he was evidently {{following}} my story with close attention. But exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> to lead, he seemed to have no idea.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course it}} became {{necessary}} to tell Ada <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> and why <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> {{and of course}} she was anxious and distressed. But she was too true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of excuse, and in a more loving spirit still--my dear devoted girl!--she wrote him a long letter, of which I took charge.|$|R
6000|$|So {{it ended}} in my saying [...] "yes," [...] and back I went {{with all my}} news to my mother, who dearly loved {{a little bit of}} gossip. She shook her head when she heard <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>going,</b> but she did not say nay, and so it was settled.|$|R
