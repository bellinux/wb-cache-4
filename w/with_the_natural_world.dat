5|$|Charles William Beebe {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, son of the {{newspaper}} executive Charles Beebe. Although some sources have described him as an only child, he had a younger brother named John who died in infancy. Early in his life, {{his family moved to}} East Orange, New Jersey, where he began to acquire both his fascination <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> and his tendency to record everything he saw. The American Museum of Natural History, which opened the year that Beebe was born, fostered Beebe's love of nature and was an early influence on him.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, {{and their}} cosmologies are {{intertwined}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> Some forests {{are believed to}} be inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of fantasy {{elements in the}} real world provides the basis for magical realism. Writers do not invent new worlds but reveal the magical in this world, as was done by Gabriel García Márquez who wrote the seminal work of the style, One Hundred Years of Solitude.

25|$|Many Wiccans also {{adopt a more}} {{explicitly}} polytheistic or animistic world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings. In many cases these spirits are associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world,</b> for instance as genius loci, fairies, and elementals. In other cases, such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical; the prominent Wiccan Sybil Leek for instance endorsed a belief in angels.|$|E
25|$|One {{societal}} {{force in}} the Middle Ages {{more powerful than the}} singular commoner, the Christian Church, rejected magic as a whole because it was viewed as a means of tampering <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> in a supernatural manner associated with the biblical verses of Deuteronomy 18:9-12. Despite the many negative connotations which surround the term magic, there exist many elements that are seen in a divine or holy light.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Eliade {{was fascinated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world,</b> which formed {{the setting of}} his very first {{literary}} attempts, {{as well as with}} Romanian folklore and the Christian faith as expressed by peasants. Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions. The young Eliade's interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue mountaineering and sailing, and he also joined the Romanian Boy Scouts.|$|E
2500|$|In Leal's view, {{writers of}} fantasy literature, such as Borges, can create [...] "new worlds, perhaps new planets. By contrast, writers like García Márquez, who use magical realism, don't create new worlds, but suggest the magical in our world." [...] In magical realism, the supernatural realm blends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural,</b> {{familiar}} <b>world.</b> This twofold world of magical realism {{differs from the}} onefold world {{that can be found}} in fairy-tale and fantasy literature.|$|R

Extremely large pieces {{can take up to}} three years. These trees vary in size from miniatures to gigantic public sculptures. Many trees have unique themes but the most common is the duality of life and death and the relationship of man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> Most trees are created and sold by artisans who have learned how to make them from their parents and grandparents.|$|E
25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> may be, {{and as much as}} such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E

25|$|Phi were {{believed}} to influence natural phenomena including human illness and thus the baci became {{an important part of}} Lao identity and religious health over the millennia.

500|$|The novel's setting {{provides}} {{the backdrop for}} a meditation {{in the style of}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted an educational setting in which lessons are provided by direct interactions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> rather than by books and coercive teachers. Singh points out that Rousseau, in Emile, or On Education, promotes the reading and even imitation of Robinson Crusoe; literary critic Fiona McCulloch argues that the unmediated knowledge the boys gain on their coral island resembles the [...] "direct language for children" [...] Rousseau advocates in Emile.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Greenwood {{had found}} a greater spiritual {{connection}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> than with organised religion. During the late 1970s, she embraced second-wave feminism and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through Starhawk's [...] (1982). Attracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality. Exploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby conducting the research underpinning Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a wealth}} of advice {{available}} to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social {{impact on the environment}} through small, inexpensive and easily achievable steps.

40|$|The {{scope of}} {{environmental}} law {{extends beyond the}} federal statutes most people associate <b>with</b> protecting <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> At both <b>the</b> state and local level, governments have broad authority to protect the environmental integrity within their jurisdiction. State legislation such as New York’s State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) affect all government actions that may have a negative environmental impact. Furthermore, local governments, using tools originally created to enhance the value and safety of property are now using this authority, and other more novel methods, to mitigate negative environmental impacts. This article gives a brief synopsis on the background of local environmental law, and then discusses where municipal governments derive environmental lawmaking power...|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Aztec system {{recognised}} three main causes of illness and injuries—supernatural causes involving the displeasure of the gods or excess and imbalance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> supernatural and <b>natural</b> <b>worlds,</b> magical causes involving malevolent curses and sorcerers (a tlacatecolotl in Nahuatl), and natural or practical causes.

500|$|In Shakespeare's day, much of {{the world}} was still being colonized by European merchants and settlers, and stories were coming back from the Americas, with myths about the Cannibals of the Caribbean, faraway Edens, and distant {{tropical}} Utopias. With the character Caliban (whose name is almost an anagram of Cannibal and also resembles [...] "Cariban", the term then used for natives in the West Indies), Shakespeare may be offering an in-depth discussion into the morality of colonialism. Different views of this are found in the play, with examples including Gonzalo's Utopia, Prospero's enslavement of Caliban, and Caliban's subsequent resentment. Caliban is also shown {{as one of the most}} natural characters in the play, being very much in touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> (and modern audiences have come to view him as far nobler than his two Old World friends, Stephano and Trinculo, although the original intent of the author may have been different). There is evidence that Shakespeare drew on Montaigne's essay Of Cannibals—which discusses the values of societies insulated from European influences—while writing The Tempest.|$|E

5000|$|Tuvans' {{belief in}} spirits is {{apparent}} in their musical practices. Praise songs and chants, called algysh, and the rhythmically chanted poetic couplets that precede breaths of throat-singing, address cher eezi, or local-spirit masters with words. Throat singing is instead made to imitate sounds produced by the places or beings in which the spirit-masters dwell. Singers establish contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spirit-master by reproducing the sounds made and enter into conversation, whose aim is supplication, an expression of gratitude, or an appeal for protection. The same imitative or mimetic interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> sound <b>world</b> may also be meditated {{through the use of}} traditional musical instruments.
