50|$|The {{mountain}} tapir or <b>woolly</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus pinchaque) is the second-smallest {{of the five}} species of tapir, only the recently described Tapirus kabomani being smaller, {{and is the only}} one to live outside of tropical rainforests in the wild. It is most easily distinguished from other tapirs by its thick woolly coat and white lips.|$|E
50|$|Large {{vertebrates}} are the cougar (Puma concolor), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), {{spectacled bear}} (Tremarctos ornatus), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), little red brocket (Mazama rufina), pacarana (Dinomys branickii), mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii) and Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus).The brown <b>woolly</b> monkey, mountain <b>tapir</b> and spectacled bear are of special concern.Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), red-crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis), Handley's slender opossum (Marmosops handleyi), white-footed tamarin (Saguinus leucopus) and mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque).Endangered reptiles include Daniel's large scale lizard (Ptychoglossus danieli) and Colombian lightbulb lizard (Riama columbiana).|$|R
25|$|Size varies between types, {{but most}} tapirs are about 2m (6.6ft) long, stand about 1m (3ft) high at the shoulder, and weigh between 150 and 300kg (330 and 700lb). Their coats are short and range in color from reddish brown, to grey, to nearly black, with the notable {{exceptions}} of the Malayan tapir, {{which has a}} white, saddle-shaped marking on its back, and the mountain tapir, which has longer, <b>woolly</b> fur. All <b>tapirs</b> have oval, white-tipped ears, rounded, protruding rumps with stubby tails, and splayed, hooved toes, with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet, which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground. Baby tapirs of all types have striped-and-spotted coats for camouflage. Females have {{a single pair of}} mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.|$|R
