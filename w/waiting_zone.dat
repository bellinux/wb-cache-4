50|$|The Doctor and Ace have a {{brief period}} of incarceration in the <b>Waiting</b> <b>Zone</b> (Terra Alpha's version of prisons), {{to find out more about}} the planet's laws against unhappiness, and meet unhappy guard Susan Q, who becomes a firm ally, and allows Ace to escape when she is taken away from the Doctor to be {{enrolled}} in the Happiness Patrol. The Doctor, meanwhile, encounters another visitor to the planet, Earl Sigma, a wandering harmonica player who stirs unrest by playing the Blues. Earl and the Doctor venture to the Kandy Kitchen, where most of the missing population of Terra Alpha vanished to, and discover Helen A's twisted executionist, the Kandy Man; a grotesque, sweet-based robot, created by Gilbert M, one of Helen A’s senior advisers.|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I argue that, {{since the}} 1980 s, French airports {{have been designed}} to exclude people from legal, human and refugee rights. The particular space where this happens has been successively called “international zone”, “transit zone” and “waiting zone” and its scope has been significantly extended overtime. I contend that French authorities have used the concept of extra-territoriality in concert with the material design of the airport to sustain exclusion. While this research focuses on France, findings bear relevance to the global governance of migrants and refugees. The French case epitomizes how states creatively use the law (or absence thereof) and geography to keep undesirable non-citizens, including asylum claimants, away from their territories. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s, the government established Paris airports’ international zones as non-French, extra-territorial spaces to circumvent domestic and international laws. I use the term “extra-territoriality” with a hyphen to refer to this deliberate excision of territory. When the Law on the <b>Waiting</b> <b>Zone</b> came into existence in 1992, exclusion was reinvented through another form of extra-territoriality, premised on the non-citizen’s legal status at the border. Since then, the term “waiting zone” has assigned both legal and geographical dimensions to this place. This research topic matters as this law established a parallel, less protective legal framework for foreign nationals arriving at the border compared to the one applicable to their counterparts already deemed on French soil - who are either applying for asylum or are to be removed after being caught for staying illegally in the country -. Yet France is a liberal democracy bound by obligations under human rights and refugee conventions at the regional and international levels. Is a less protective system of rights based on the distinction between physical and legal entry necessary? I was drawn to the <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> for my research because it is an understudied area; the <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> is physically difficult to access, yet important to understand. I chose to focus on Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport’s <b>waiting</b> <b>zone,</b> which detains the greatest number of individuals in France. I sought to answer several research questions. First, how did the Law on the <b>Waiting</b> <b>Zone</b> come to existence? Second, does the Law on the <b>Waiting</b> <b>Zone</b> constitute a break from the initial phase of extra-territoriality? In other words, is the term “extra-territoriality” inappropriate to describe the current situation of non-citizens placed under the <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> regime? Third, how do actors working in and on the <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> perceive this legal regime and their role therein? Finally, how are foreign nationals being treated in CDG airport’s <b>waiting</b> <b>zone?</b> Do they have access to rights, or do they face barriers? Different research methods were used to answer these questions. I engaged in discourse analysis of a variety of sources and carried out 35 semi-structured expert interviews. Participants were asked to answer questions regarding their perception of the legal framework applying to the border zone, their role and actions therein. Finally, I used the participant observation method at CDG airport...|$|E

30|$|STEPS (Simulation of Transient and Pedestrian movementS) (Mott MacDonald 2011) {{is a fine}} {{network model}} {{developed}} by the Mott MacDonald simulation group. The model is a commercial tool freely available for educational purposes. The movement towards the exits is calculated {{through the use of}} a potential map. STEPS also allows the user to define specific routes through the use of checkpoints. The agents are represented through a list of factors which include unimpeded walking speeds, awareness, patience, and pre-evacuation time. The exit route of the agents is based on the agent’s patience coefficients in order to represent their likelihood of waiting in a queue. Evacuation elevators can be represented within the model through a series of attributes concerning the kinematic, physical, and operational aspects of the vertical evacuation. Behavioural performance is represented automatically by the model with no explicit user control of how many agents will use an elevator on a given floor or their waiting time for the elevators. Nevertheless, these behaviours can be represented implicitly, e.g., through the use of <b>waiting</b> <b>zones,</b> patience coefficients, etc. The main advantage of the model is the representation of the interactions between horizontal and vertical components. The limitations are associated with the implicit representation of the behavioural factors associated to vertical egress components and the problems deriving from the use of a fine network approach (e.g., case studies with high densities may be dependent on the grid employed).|$|R
40|$|In this study, three signal control {{strategies}} such as Bike box, Hook-turn, and 6 -phase {{were assessed}} for various traffic conditions at signalized intersections incorporating bicycle left-turn traffic. Results showed {{that the size of}} a <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> mainly affected the performance of signal control in both Bike box and Hook-turn. Both Bike box and Hook-turn yielded an identical vehicle delay, but Bike box produced less bicycle delay than Hook-turn by 2. 5 ~ 29. 9 sec/veh for undersaturated traffic conditions. For saturated traffic condition, Bike box produced less vehicle delay than Hook-turn and 6 -phase strategies, but bicycle delay was found to increase at the 700 vph of bicycle traffic compared to 6 -phase. Bicycle delay was greatly increased under Hook-turn and Bike box strategies when bicycle traffic was greater than 300 vph and 500 vph, respectively. It was also shown that bicycle delay could be significantly reduced by providing appropriate size of queueing space. In addition, Bike box was likely to yield less vehicle and bicycle delay than Hook-turn for traffic volume pattern...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pedestrian hopping model and a traffic signal scheduling strategy with consideration of both pedestrians and {{vehicles in the}} urban traffic system. Firstly, a novel mathematical model consisting of several logic constraints is proposed to describe the pedestrian flow in the urban traffic network and its dynamics are captured by the hopping rule, which depicts the changing capacity of each time interval from one <b>waiting</b> <b>zone</b> to another. Based on the hopping mechanism, the pedestrian traffic light scheduling problems are formulated by two different performance standards: pedestrian delay and pedestrian unhappiness. Then the mathematical technique and the meta-heuristic approach are both adopted to solve the scheduling problem: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for pedestrian delay model and discrete harmony search algorithm (DHS) for both pedestrian delay model and unhappiness model. Secondly, a mathematical model about the vehicle traffic network, which captures drivers psychological responses to the traffic light signals, is introduced. Thirdly, a traffic light scheduling strategy to minimize the trade-off of the delays between pedestrians and vehicles is proposed. Finally, we translate this traffic signal scheduling problem for both pedestrians and vehicles into a MILP problem which can be solved by several existing tools, e. g., GUROBI. Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our real-time traffic light scheduling for pedestrian movement and the potential impact to the vehicle traffic flows by the pedestrian movement.

40|$|Corporate flight crews face unique {{challenges}} including unscheduled flights, quickly changing schedules, {{extended duty}} days, long <b>waits,</b> time <b>zone</b> changes, and peripheral tasks. Most corporate operations are regulated by Part 91 FARs which set no flight or duty time limits. The {{objective of this}} study was to identify operationally significant factors that may influence fatigue, alertness, and performance in corporate operations. In collaboration with the National Business Aircraft Association and the Flight Safety Foundation, NASA developed and distributed a retrospective survey comprising 107 questions addressing demographics, home sleep habits, flight experience, duty schedules, fatigue during operations, and work environment. Corporate crewmembers returned 1, 488 surveys. Respondents averaged 45. 2 years of age, had 14. 9 years of corporate flying experience, and 9, 750 total flight hours. The majority (89 %) rated themselves as 'good' or 'very good' sleepers at home. Most (82 %) indicated they are subject to call for duty and described an average duty day of 9. 9 h. About two-thirds reported having a daily duty time limit and over half (57 %) reported a daily flight time limit. Nearly three-quarters (71 %) acknowledged having 'nodded off' during a flight. Only 21 % reported that their flight departments offer training on fatigue issues. Almost three-quarters (74 %) described fatigue as a 'moderate' or 'serious' concern, and a majority (61 %) characterized it as a common occurrence. Most (85 %) identified fatigue as a 'moderate' or 'serious' safety issue...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} the trip mode choice problem by using {{cumulative}} prospect theory (CPT) rather than utility maximization from the network uncertainty perspective and evaluates {{the effect of the}} integrated service mode on taxi network equilibrium. The integrated service mode means taxis either are actively moving through traffic zones to pick up customers (cruising mode) or are queued {{at the center of a}} <b>zone</b> <b>waiting</b> for customers (dispatch mode). Based on this, CPT models are adopted to analyze the choice of customers’ trip mode. The travel time uncertainty of the network and the applicability of CPT are considered first, and the Nested Logit model was used to complete the trip mode split problem. Further, several relevant relationships including supply-demand equilibrium, network conditions, taxi behavior, and customer behavior perspectives were analyzed with respect to the integrated mode. Moreover, a network equilibrium model was established and its algorithm was designed. Finally, this paper presented a numerical example and discussed the taxi network equilibrium’s characteristic after introducing the integrated service mode...|$|R
