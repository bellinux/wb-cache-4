To distinguish candidate vaccine <b>strains</b> from <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> isolated during these trials, we developed PCR assays specific to two sets of candidate vaccine strains. The two sets were a group A strain (3 A), its three attenuated, temperature-sensitive variant strains, a group B strain (2 B), and its four attenuated, temperature-sensitive variant strains. The PCR assays were evaluated by testing 18 group A <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains,</b> the 3 A strains, 9 group B <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains,</b> and the 2 B strains. PCR specific to group A <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> amplified only group A <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains,</b> and 3 A-specific PCR amplified only 3 A strains. PCR specific to group B <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> amplified all group A and group B strains but gave a 688 -bp product for group B <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains,</b> a 279 -bp product for 2 B strains, a 547 -bp product for all group A strains, and an additional 688 -bp product for some group A strains, including 3 A strains.

5000|$|The MNR2 gene encodes {{a protein}} {{closely related to}} the Alr proteins, but {{includes}} conserved features that define a distinct subgroup of CorA proteins in fungal genomes, suggesting a distinct role in Mg2+ homeostasis. Like an alr1 mutant, growth of an mnr2 mutant was sensitive to Mg2+-deficient conditions, but the mnr2 mutant was observed to accumulate more Mg2+ than a <b>wild-type</b> <b>strain</b> under these conditions. These phenotypes suggested that Mnr2 may regulate Mg2+ storage within an intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, the Mnr2 protein was localized to the membrane of the vacuole, an internal compartment implicated in the storage of excess mineral nutrients by yeast. A direct role of Mnr2 in Mg2+ transport was suggested by the observation that increased Mnr2 expression, which redirected some Mnr2 protein to the cell surface, also suppressed the Mg2+-requirement of an alr1 alr2 double mutant strain. Interestingly, the mnr2 mutation also altered accumulation of other divalent cations, suggesting this mutation may increase Alr gene expression or protein activity. Recent work [...] supported this model, by showing that Alr1 activity was increased in an mnr2 mutant strain, and that the mutation was associated with induction of Alr1 activity at a higher external Mg concentration than was observed for an Mnr2 <b>wild-type</b> <b>strain.</b> These effects were observed without any change in Alr1 protein accumulation, again indicating that Alr1 activity may be regulated directly by the Mg concentration within the cell.|$|E
50|$|In genetics, {{a strain}} {{is said to}} be auxotrophic if it carries a {{mutation}} that renders it unable to synthesize an essential compound. For example, a yeast mutant with an inactivated uracil synthesis pathway gene is a uracil auxotroph (e.g., if the yeast Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene is inactivated, the resultant strain is a uracil auxotroph). Such a strain is unable to synthesize uracil and will only be able to grow if uracil can be taken up from the environment. This is the opposite of a uracil prototroph, or in this case a <b>wild-type</b> <b>strain,</b> which can still grow in the absence of uracil. Auxotrophic genetic markers are often used in molecular genetics; they were famously used in Beadle and Tatum's Nobel prize-winning work on the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis.|$|E

During switching from <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> to variants, patches of the S-layer lattices characteristics for <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains,</b> granular regions, and areas with oblique lattice symmetry could be observed on the surface of individual cells from all organisms. The granular regions apparently consisted of mixtures of the S-layer proteins from the <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> and the newly synthesized p 2 S-layer proteins from the variants. S-layer proteins from <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> possessed identical N-terminal regions but led to quite different cleavage products upon peptide mapping, indicating that they are encoded by different genes.

5000|$|Original genetic {{studies by}} gel {{electrophoresis}} {{led to the}} finding of the genome size, ca. 35 megabases, with 7 chromosomes and 1 mitochondrial chromosome. In the 1980s the mitochondrial chromosome was sequenced. Then in 2003 a pilot study was initiated to sequence regions bordering chromosome V`s centromere using BAC clones and direct sequencing. In 2008, a 10x whole genome draft sequence was published. The genome size is now estimated to be 35-36 megabases. Genetic manipulation in fungi is difficult due to low homologous recombination efficiency and ectopic integrations (insertion of gene at undesirable location) and thus a hindrance in genetic studies (allele replacement and knockouts). [...] Although in 2005, a method for gene deletion (knock-outs) was developed based on a model for Aspergillus nidulans that involved cosmid plasmid transformation, a better system for Podospora was developed in 2008 by using a strain that lacked nonhomologous end joining proteins (Ku (protein), known in Podospora as PaKu70). This method claimed to have 100% of transformants undergo desired homologous recombination leading to allelic replacement (after the transformation, the PaKu70 deletion can be restored by crossing over with a <b>wild-type</b> <b>strain</b> to yield progeny with only the targeted gene deletion or allelic exchange (e.g. point mutation)).|$|E

5000|$|Transfer of the {{released}} mtDNA {{into the}} nucleus: The {{first step in}} the transferring process is the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. Thorsness and Fox demonstrated the rate of relocation of mtDNA from mitochondria into the nucleus using ura3- [...] yeast strain with an engineered URA3 plasmid, required gene for uracil biosynthesis, in the mitochondria. During the propagation of such yeast strains carrying a nuclear ura3 [...] mutation, plasmid DNA that escapes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, complements the uracil biosynthetic defect, restoring growth in the absence of uracil, and easily scored phenotype. The rate of DNA transfer from the mitochondria to the nucleus was estimated as 2 x 10-5 per cell per generation while the opposite, in the case of cox2 mutant, the rate of the transfer of plasmid from the nucleus to the mitochondria is apparently at least 100,000 times less. Many factors control the rate of mtDNA escapes from mitochondria to the nucleus. The higher rate of mutation in mtDNA in comparison with nDNA in the cells of many organisms is an important factor promoting the transfer of mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome. One of the intergenic factors results in the higher destruction rate of mitochondrial macromolecules, including mtDNA, is the presence of high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated in mitochondria as the by-products in ATP synthesis mechanism. Some other factors influencing the escape of mtDNA from mitochondria include the action of mutagenic agents and other forms of cellular stress that can damage mitochondria or their membranes, which proves that is possible to assume that exogenous damaging agents (ionizing radiation and chemical genotoxic agents) increase the rate of mtDNA escape into the cytoplasm. [...] Thorsness and Fox continued their research to find the endogenous factors affecting mtDNA escape into the nucleus. They isolated and studied 21 nuclear mutants with different combinations of mutations in at least 12 nuclear loci called the yme (yeast mitochondrial escape) mutations, in different environmental conditions since some of these mutations cause temperature sensitivity. They found out these mutations which perturb mitochondrial functions, due to the alteration of gene products, affect mitochondrial integrity and led to mtDNA escape to the cytoplasm. Additionally, defects in the proteins change the rate of mtDNA transfer into the nucleus. For instance, in the case of yme1 mutant, abnormal mitochondria are targeted for degradation by the vacuole, with the help of pep4 , a major proteinase, and degradation increases mtDNA escape to the nucleus through the process of mitophagy. In addition, Thorsness and Campbell found that by disruption of pep4, the frequency of mtDNA escape in yme1 strains decreases. Similarly, the disruption of PRC1, which encodes carboxypeptidase Y, lowers the rate of mtDNA escape in yme1 yeast. Evidence shows that mitophagy is one of the possible ways for mtDNA transfer into the nucleus and determined to be the most supported pathway up to now. Some other possible pathways are shown in figure 1. The first pathway, as it was explained, is a yme1mutant that results in inactivation of YMe1p protein, a mitochondrial-localized ATP-dependent metalloproteinase, leading to high escape rate of mtDNA to the nucleus. Mitochondria of yme1 strain are taken up for degradation by the vacuole more frequently than the <b>wild-type</b> <b>strain.</b> Moreover, cytological investigations have suggested several other possible pathways in the diverse number of species, including a lysis of the mitochondrial compartment, direct physical connection and membrane fusion between mitochondria and nucleus, and encapsulation of mitochondrial compartments inside the nucleus, as shown in figure 1.|$|E

40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{expression}} of certain genes and operons, including the fructose operon, {{is controlled by}} Cra, the pleiotropic catabolite repressor/activator protein formerly known as FruR.

The glucose-specific IIA protein (IIAgIc) of the phosphotransferase system, which activates adenylate cyclase when phosphorylated, is largely dephosphorylated in cra but not <b>wild-type</b> <b>strains</b> growing under these conditions. Dephosphorylation of llAglC in cra strains apparently results from enhanced fructose operon transcription and fructose uptake.

The results indicate that for K- 1 -positive blood culture strains of E. coli, K- 1 expression is a prerequisite for serum resistance, and loss of ability to synthesize K- 1 leads to loss of serum resistance...|$|R
