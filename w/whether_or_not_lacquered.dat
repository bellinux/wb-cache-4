Our results on this topic solve an open problem posed by Chapman (1987), and clear up some difficulties with his undecidability theorems. For those cases where planning is decidable, we explain how the time complexity varies depending on a wide variety of conditions: &#x 02022;• <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> function symbols are allowed;&#x 02022;• <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> delete lists are allowed;&#x 02022;• <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> negative preconditions are allowed;&#x 02022;• <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the predicates are restricted to be propositional (i. e., 0 -ary);&#x 02022;• whether the planning operators are given as part of the input to the planning problem, or instead are fixed in advance. &#x 02022;• <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the operators can have conditional effects...|$|R
