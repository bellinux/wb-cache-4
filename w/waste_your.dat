500|$|Upon its release, [...] "One Minute" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics, with one considering {{it to be the}} musical highlight of My December, along with [...] "Never Again" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Time". Following strong radio airplay, the song debuted at number 41 in Australia, reaching its peak of number 36 a week later. No accompanying music video was recorded for the song; however, Clarkson promoted it through few live appearances, including at Daytona 500 on February 2007, and on Take 40's Live Lounge.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson's third studio album, My December, {{which has}} a more rock-influenced sound than its predecessor, was {{released}} in June 2007. The album's release became a subject of a dispute with the music mogul and the then-Chairman and CEO of the RCA Music Group Clive Davis, who wanted Clarkson to make significant changes and record new material for the album. My December was later certified platinum by the RIAA, but failed to match the sales of its predecessor by suffering poor publicity for its uncommercial nature and thus became her least-commercially successful album in the United States to date. Its lead single, [...] "Never Again", became a top-ten hit in four countries, including the United States. Three more singles from the album, [...] "Sober", [...] "One Minute", and [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Time", were released.|$|E
500|$|... "One Minute" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On his review for My December, Josh Love of Stylus Magazine {{wrote that the}} song, along with [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Time", [...] "as lyrically sour as they may be, [...] are both fantastically layered pop-rockers." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly considered the album to be Clarkson's [...] "darker, more personal, riskier" [...] release until that point. Willman added that [...] "One Minute" [...] was a [...] "lighter [...] that (take note, Team Clive!) would make [...] dandy warm-weather [...]" [...] Michael Endelman of Spin considered it a [...] "snarling disco rock" [...] song, while Nick Levine of Digital Spy deemed it [...] "pounding [...] insistent." [...] Penn Live blogger Ashley Z. said that [...] "the anger on this record can be overwhelming at times," [...] which could be an argument for the [...] "existence" [...] of [...] "One Minute". Allmusic long-time contributor Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered it the highlight of My December, along with [...] "Never Again" [...] and [...] "Irvine", writing that the song [...] "give this album some much needed spark." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding which musical {{artists have}} {{influenced}} him, Lecrae, {{in an interview}} with Essence, cited Tupac, Nas, DJ Quik, Scarface, and The Cross Movement. In an interview with The Christian Post, Lecrae listed his top favorite five hip hop artists as Tupac, Nas, The Ambassador, Snoop Dogg, and, though for his business approach rather than his music, Jay Z. Lecrae also names Outkast and Lauryn Hill as major influences, particularly their albums Aquemini and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, respectively, and considers Hill's song [...] "Adam Lives in Theory" [...] as the top song that nourishes him spiritually. In the song [...] "Non-Fiction", he lists the Tunnel Rats alongside The Cross Movement as an influence when he was newly converted to Christianity. Theologically, Lecrae follows the Reformed tradition of theology and is considered an influential figure in the New Calvinist movement. He cites Tommy Nelson, John MacArthur, and John Piper, among others, as early influences on his Christian faith, and Lecrae even titled one of his hit songs, [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Life", after the book of the same name by Piper. Lecrae explains that through Nelson, MacArthur, and Piper, he subsequently discovered Spurgeon, Calvin, and Francis Schaeffer, the last of whom Lecrae calls his [...] "personal hero". Other theologians cited by Lecrae include Tim Keller, Andy Crouch, Randy Alcorn, and Abraham Kuyper. He also looks to Martin Luther King, Jr. for inspiration on working out faith in social issues.|$|E
500|$|American singer Kelly Clarkson has {{recorded}} material for her seven studio albums. After signing a contract in 2002 with RCA Records, {{a division of}} then-Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music), 20-year-old Clarkson released the double A-side single [...] "Before Your Love" [...] / [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] and began to record tracks for her debut studio album, Thankful (2003). Its lead single, [...] "Miss Independent", received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2004. [...] "Miss Independent" [...] was followed by [...] "Low" [...] and [...] "The Trouble With Love Is", which was featured as a single from the soundtrack of the film Love Actually. In 2004, Clarkson recorded the song [...] "Breakaway", which was released as a single from the [...] of the film [...] The song's commercial success inspired Clarkson to name her second studio album Breakaway. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2006, while its second single, [...] "Since U Been Gone", won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Subsequent singles, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] (2005), [...] "Because of You" [...] (2005), and [...] "Walk Away" [...] (2006), became successful hits. Clarkson's third studio album, My December, was released in 2007. The album became a subject of a dispute with then RCA Music Group chairman Clive Davis, who criticized the album and suggested that Clarkson reunite with her previous collaborators.

Succeeding releases from My December included [...] "Sober", [...] "One Minute", and [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Time".|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to <b>waste</b> <b>your</b> time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

The track uses backward reverb effects and features a question and answer technique between Holder and the other band members Hill and Lea during the chorus. [...] "Chakeeta" [...] is a more commercial sounding track on the album. [...] "Don't <b>Waste</b> <b>Your</b> Time (Back Seat Star)" [...] is an acoustic-based ballad, described by Holder in 1988 as a [...] "surrealistic social comment".
