Relative humidities were usually close to ice saturation, particularly during the winter, but ice <b>supersaturations</b> <b>of</b> up to 20 % were frequently measured. Supersaturation with respect to liquid water was rarely observed. During the summer, diurnal variation in temperature drove a daily cycle in relative humidity, although corresponding variations in mixing ratio were comparatively small.

40|$|International audienceWe {{performed}} decompression {{experiments to}} simulate the ascent of a phenocryst-bearing rhyolitic magma in a volcanic conduit. The starting materials were bubble-free rhyolites water-saturated at 200 MPa– 800 °C under oxidizing conditions: they contained 6. 0 wt% dissolved H 2 O and a dense population of hematite crystals (8. 7 ± 2 9 105 mm- 3). Pressure was decreased from the saturation value to a final value ranging from 99 to 20 MPa, at constant temperature (800 C); the rate of decompression was either 1, 000 or 27. 8 kPa/s. In all experiments, we observed a single event of heterogeneous bubble nucleation beginning at a pressure PN equal to 63 ± 3 MPa in the 1, 000 kPa/s series, and to 69 ± 1 MPa in the 27. 8 kPa/s series. Below PN, the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supersaturation</b> in the liquid rapidly decreased to a few 0. 1 wt%, the nucleation rate dropped, and the bubble number density (BND) stabilized to a value strongly sensitive to decompression rate: 80 mm- 3 at 27. 8 kPa/s vs. 5, 900 mm- 3 at 1, 000 kPa/s. This behaviour is like the behavior formerly described {{in the case of}} homogeneous bubble nucleation in the rhyolite-H 2 O system and in numerical simulations of vesiculation in ascending magmas. Similar degrees <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supersaturation</b> were measured at 27. 8 and 1, 000 kPa/s, implying that a faster decompression rate does not result in a larger departure from equilibrium. Our experimental results imply that BNDs in acid to intermediate magmas ascending in volcanic conduits will depend on both the decompression rate jdP=dtj and the number density of phenocrysts, especially the number density of magnetite microphenocrysts (1 – 100 mm- 3), which is the only mineral species able to reduce significantly the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supersaturation</b> required for bubble nucleation. Very low BNDs (& 1 mm- 3) are predicted in the case of effusive eruptions (jdP=dtj & 0. 1 kPa/s). High BNDs (up to 107 mm- 3) and bimodal bubble size distributions are expected in the case of explosive eruptions: (1) a relatively small number density of bubbles (1 – 100 mm- 3) will first nucleate in {{the lower part of the}} conduit (jdP=dtj & 10 kPa/s), either at high pressure on magnetite or at lower pressure on quartz and feldspar (or by homogeneous nucleation in the liquid) and (2) then, extreme decompression rates near the fragmentation level (jdP=dtj & 103 kPa/s) will trigger a major nucleation event leading to the multitude of small bubbles, typically a few micrometers to a few tens of micrometers in diameter, which characterizes most silicic pumices...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{investigate}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and activation efficiencies {{as a function of}} two independent variables, aerosol particle size and water vapor supersaturation. To date, most ambient CCN measurements have been made as the integral (total) CCN concentration as a function <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor <b>supersaturation</b> only. However, since CCN properties of aerosol particles are strongly dependent on particle size, as well as on chemical composition, which commonly varies with particle size, more detailed measurements can provide additional important information about the CCN activation. With size-resolved measurements, the effect of particle size on CCN activity can be kept constant, which makes it possible to directly assess the influence of particle chemistry. The instrumental set-up consists of a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) to select particles of a known size, within a narrow size range. A condensation nuclei (CN) counter (condensation particle counter, CPC) is used to count the total number of particles in that size range, and a CCN counter is used to count the number of CCN as a function <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> in that same size range. The activation efficiency, expressed as CCN/CN ratios, can thus directly be calculated as a function of particle size and supersaturation.

40|$|Fundamental {{properties}} <b>of</b> ice <b>supersaturation</b> {{variability in}} cirrus clouds are studied {{by means of}} an idealized probabilistic model. Damped supersaturation fluctuations are assumed to be exponentially correlated in time, statistically stationary, and normally distributed.

The temporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation</b> separates into an early ballistic and a late asymptotic regime. The latter allows for a stationary solution for the probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation</b> in the presence of cloud ice and corresponds to a diffusive solution in cloud-free conditions. Low ice crystal number densities, small ice crystal sizes, short supersaturation correlation times, and large fluctuation intensities favor the spreading of cirrus ice crystal sizes, especially in conditions conducive to sublimation. Otherwise, size spreading of ice crystals is hampered by ice-induced damping <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation</b> fluctuations.

These L-amino acids, including serine, glycine, alanine, valine, methionine and phenylalanine, are categorized as hydrophilic and hydrophobic according to their affinities to water. Different amino acids show distinct effects on the surface tension; even the same amino acid has different influence on the surface tension for planar and spherical interfaces.

Assuming a typical biomass burning aerosol size distribution (accumulation mode centred at 120 nm), we have calculated initial cloud droplet number concentrations (NCD) {{for a wide range}} of updraft velocities (w= 0. 5 – 20 m s&minus; 1 ) and aerosol particle number concentrations (NCN= 10 3 – 10 5 cm&minus; 3 ) at the cloud base. Depending on the ratio between updraft velocity and particle number concentration (w/NCN), we found three distinctly different regimes of CCN activation and cloud droplet formation: 1. An aerosol-limited regime that is characterized by high w/NCN ratios (>&#x 2248; 10 &minus; 3 m s&minus; 1 cm 3 ), high maximum values <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapour <b>supersaturation</b> (Smax&gt;&#x 2248; 0. 5 %), and high activated fractions of aerosol particles (NCD/NCN&gt;&#x 2248; 90 %).

A novel ceramic thin films deposition technique {{has been developed}} and studied systematically. This technique employs controlled hydrolysis of inorganic salt as precursor from aqueous solutions at low temperature. It starts with the nucleation followed by growth of the particles. The nucleation can take place through homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation. One of the determining parameters seems to the degree <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> which is the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation. In light of this, our work first focused on the definition and calculation <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> and our experiments then indicated the role <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>supersaturation</b> in nucleation and growth and further deposition processes.
