I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|E

On May 31, Nina confirmed that [...] "Hagkan" [...] will be included in the album. On July 15, she confirmed that the album will be released by the end of month, and that they were just finishing up three songs. She further stated that her commitment to the album was the reason behind her constant absence in ASAP. On August 5, 2011, Jay R tweeted that he was working on a collaboration song between Nina and Jimmy Muna. On August 16, Nina tweeted her first publicized picture from the album's photo shoot. In September 2011, she confirmed that the album will finally be released by the last week of the month, proudly expressing the time and effort she exerted for it. She also stated that she did not pressure herself during its production, saying that her main goal is to create a different kind of music for her fans and that she does not expect for it to be a huge hit.

Leverich explains that Williams to the end was concerned with [...] "the depths and origin of human feelings and motivations, the difference being that he had gone into a deeper, more obscure realm, which, of course, put the poet in him to the fore, and not the playwright who would bring much concern for audience and critical reaction” (xxiii).|$|R

40|$|The 1990 's {{constituted}} {{a turning point}} in Japan, this was when many companies cut regular employees for restructuring and to cut labour costs. Japanese companies felt it necessary to implement more performance based pay and promotion systems to remain competitive on the global market. Many companies can cut labour costs by employing a lot of part time workers on irregular payrolls and as a result there are many working poor, who, although <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> are struggling <b>to</b> survive on such low salaries. Differences in incomes bring about a social gap between those with money and those without. We can recognise that {{there is a big difference}} in the social gap today compared to several years ago. I have studied the upward trend of the number of working poor, that is, the increase in poverty in the in the contemporary society. I have paid particular attention to studying the labour policy and social welfare after the mid 1990 's. Once the young are thrown into unemployment it is difficult to become a regular employee and especially during the depression it is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for anyone <b>to</b> find a job. As a result, there are a lot of jobless, part-time workers and NEETS (Not in Education, Employment or Training) living on the poverty line. They cannot make a proper living and live a lonely life of social exclusion. The national pension system is the cause of a financial crisis today. Many part time workers can't carry medical insurance or unemployment insurance can't have an employees' pension and if they were to lose their jobs they wouldn't be eligible to collect unemployment benefit. We should seriously consider setting a safety net and establishing a national minimum as a standard of living giving our less fortunate citizens more security in their lives...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{issues for}} improving the education of children with special needs. In the two schools where I undertook my study, I could see that teachers in both contexts worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{for the improvement of}} education of children with special needs. In the special school the teachers were trained {{from time to time in}} order to better their professional skills and to understand the children 2 ̆ 7 s needs. In contrast, in the regular school, although teachers were trained in various areas related to different subjects and the pedagogy of teaching learning activities, there was a strong need for teachers to be trained in the field of special education. Teachers in both contexts were <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> in order <b>to</b> help the students function in society and the world. One of the major issues concerning children with special needs is how best to integrate them in regular schools with other children. Children with mild and moderate disabilities can be integrated into the regular school system if special care is taken in their initial stages of learning. Whereas children with severe disabilities cannot be so readily integrated into regular schools but can be in schools especially designed to cater to their needs. The educational practices in the regular and special schools are being developed with the needs of the child in mind. This refers to the teaching strategies, curriculum design, activities of daily living, extra curricular activities, art, and music. From time to time teachers are being given in-service training so as to better their professional skills and to help the child to do better in order to function in society. Parents in both context are playing a key role in educating their special children in the hope that there would be a bright future for them. The implications drawn from the study indicate that integration and inclusion of children with special needs are still being considered by stakeholders. In my opinion there is a hope and possibility that children with special needs in the future will work alongside all other children in regular schools...|$|R
