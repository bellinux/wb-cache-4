2500|$|In August 2002, Aharon Varady {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} an [...] "Open Siddur Project," [...] a digital humanities project developing a database of Jewish liturgy and related work ("historic and contemporary, familiar and obscure") and a <b>web-to-print</b> application for users to contribute content and compile their own siddurim. All content in the database would be sourced from the Public Domain or else shared by copyright owners with Open Content licenses. Lack of available fonts supporting the full range of Hebrew diacritics in Unicode kept the idea from being immediately workable. The idea was revived on New Year's Eve December 2008 when Varady was introduced to Efraim Feinstein who was pursuing a similar goal. In the summer of 2009, the renewed project was publicly launched {{with the help of the}} PresenTense Institute, an incubator for social entrepreneurship. While the application remains in development, all code for the project is publicly shared on GitHub with an LGPL. Meanwhile, liturgy and related work is being shared at [...] with any one of the three Open Content licenses authored by the Creative Commons: the CC0 Public Domain dedication, the CC BY attribution license, and the CC BY-SA Attribution/ShareAlike license. The Open Siddur Project also maintains a package of open-source licensed Unicode Hebrew digital fonts collecting fonts from Culmus and other open-source font foundries. Wikisource is currently the transcription environment for digitizing printed Public Domain content by the Open Siddur Project.|$|E
50|$|The main {{challenge}} for <b>web-to-print</b> expansion {{is centered on}} both the affordability of this solution and software and hardware companies' abilities to converge desktop vector-graphic tools with server technologies designed expressly for a <b>web-to-print</b> goal. While specific software {{set the stage for}} major print houses to offer <b>web-to-print</b> services to corporate clients and to the general public, brand name software companies have nudged into this business to offer mid- to high-range solutions.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{development}} in the <b>web-to-print</b> world is mobile applications. Followed by the increased usage of smartphones, {{and the ability to}} create better software for mobile devices, the ability to use <b>web-to-print</b> services from responsive-design website or even native applications is now available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Web-to-print</b> {{increasingly}} {{calls for}} a Portable Document Format (PDF) workflow environment with output provided by digital printing; although there is certainly no requirement that fulfillment be accomplished using digital production equipment; <b>web-to-print</b> is also used today by printers with both offset and digital production facilities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Web-to-print,</b> {{also known}} as Web2Print, remote {{publishing}} or print e-commerce is a broad term that refers {{to the practice of}} doing print business using web sites. Companies and software solutions that deal in <b>web-to-print</b> often bleed into more standard e-commerce and online services like hosting, website design, and cross medial marketing.|$|E

50|$|Commercial <b>web-to-print</b> {{applications}} {{can include}} both print on demand (POD) or pre-printed {{materials that are}} pulled from inventory. (POD) documents can have static content or include elements of variable data printing (VDP), a form of POD that is mainly used for personalization of marketing materials with product or customer data that is pulled from a database. VDP is geared toward mass customization, whereas <b>web-to-print</b> focuses only on changes made from order to order. VDP pre dates <b>web-to-print</b> although {{at that time the}} design process was carried out via close collaboration with the printer for documents such as invoices.|$|E
5000|$|DTP’s history {{provides}} {{the groundwork for}} current <b>web-to-print</b> expansion, and the onset of e-commerce between 1998 and 2000 created an environment for <b>web-to-print</b> to prosper. However, {{it should be noted}} that <b>web-to-print</b> and the framework for it had been well established by commercial developments in some years before this. For instance Xerox Corporation (one of the companies that has been attributed to the origins of the Internet [...] ) had a commercial product available for sale in 1995 called InterDoc, which is described as software that allowed printing departments to receive and produce digital file submissions from customers over the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|To {{address the}} {{prohibitive}} cost of traditional <b>web-to-print</b> software solutions (software, systems, periodic software upgrades, technical staff, ...) noted earlier, providers offer <b>web-to-print</b> as [...] "hosted" [...] or software {{as a service}} (SaaS) solutions. Using this model application creation, maintenance, enhancement, technical support, application upgrades, and hosting, are provided as an out-sourced service. Since the software, systems, and support resources are spread over a larger client base costs can be reduced significantly. This makes it possible for any print house or print broker to offer professional <b>web-to-print</b> applications and services [...] with only a modest investment of time and capital.|$|E
50|$|<b>Web-to-print</b> sites {{often provide}} {{approval}} mechanism so that managers can approve print requests by their employees.|$|E

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} to {{this system}} {{as it exists}} today is that small- to mid-sized print houses and print brokers are limited in their access to software and server system solutions for a <b>web-to-print</b> service offering to clients. Most proprietary and trade name software that was developed with <b>web-to-print</b> projects in mind remains prohibitively expensive for this sector. Additionally, these systems often {{require the use of}} digital systems that only a larger print house would maintain.|$|E

50|$|<b>Web-to-print</b> {{sites are}} {{available}} for commercial users or to the general public. A common offering from print houses is public or private online storefronts or catalogues.|$|E
50|$|The {{front-end}} of the <b>web-to-print</b> {{process is}} similar to desktop publishing (DTP) in that individuals or graphic designers use desktop publishing software to create pre-defined templates. These templates are then posted online for later customization by end-users and automated production by a print house or commercial printer. Unlike DTP, <b>web-to-print</b> can bypass the use of traditional design tools by the end-user as the templates utilized in this process are based upon a WYSIWYG (often browser-based) interface that can be edited and approved by a client and by the print house without a graphic designer’s assistance.|$|E
50|$|Another {{niche in}} <b>web-to-print</b> {{solutions}} that {{is seen by}} some as being an indicator {{of things to come}} is the provision of WYSIWYG design support. Products provide such ability by allowing elements within a template to be moved, inserted, and deleted by end-users following strict rules established by the administrator of the system. This WYSIWYG generally supported by Adobe Flash technology which gives freedom from browser and OS dependency. This type of system begins to blur the lines between Desktop Publishing applications and <b>web-to-print</b> systems, and lets non-designers edit and proof customized artwork within a 'safe' environment.|$|E
50|$|Materials {{produced}} by a <b>web-to-print</b> process include business cards, brochures, and stationery, among other printed matter, that can be printed in full color or {{in black and white}} on various papers and on various presses.|$|E

50|$|<b>Web-to-print</b> {{systems are}} also {{expanding}} to handle personalization {{and distribution of}} other marketing materials such as presentations, seminars, logo items, and even email and other electronic media. This change is driven by enterprise clients seeking a single repository/tool to manage all marketing efforts including print.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>web-to-print</b> sites offer online print {{products}} that replace editing tools like Adobe InDesign where buyers can author work and alter the typeface, copy, images, and layout. These products often include {{a library of}} templates for product types, such as post cards, posters, flyers etc.|$|E
50|$|PediaPress was {{established}} to provide an online service that enabled Web users to create customized books from wiki content, an example of <b>web-to-print</b> technology. According to the German edition of PC World, the price was €8.00 for the first 100 pages, plus €3.00 for each additional 100 pages.|$|E
5000|$|At drupa 2008, Indigo {{unveiled}} a new workflow strategy for their portfolio called HP SmartStream, {{based on their}} own development and on partnerships with other industry vendors. Among the announcements was a <b>web-to-print</b> product in partnership with Press-Sense (later bought by Bitstream makers of Pageflex.) [...] They also released new versions of their Digital Front Ends (DFEs).|$|E
50|$|This {{technology}} is often leveraged in <b>web-to-print</b> solutions for corporate intranets to enable customization and ordering of printed materials, advertising automation workflows inside of advertising agencies, catalog generation solutions for retailers and variable digital print on demand solutions for highly personalized {{one to one}} marketing. The output from these solutions is often printed by a digital printing press.|$|E
50|$|The PediaPress.com <b>web-to-print</b> service {{worked on}} all MediaWikis that had {{installed}} the Collection extension. To check whether a wiki supports PediaPress, users could {{look for a}} box entitled “Create a book” in the navigation sidebar. Some sites offering the service included the German Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and the OpenOffice.org Wiki; extending it to all language editions of Wikipedia was also proposed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term has}} become ubiquitous, as {{businesses}} have picked upon the [...] "Web2Print" [...] phrase to name software {{designed specifically to}} manage the <b>web-to-print</b> process. Graphic design and web design firms that have branched out into print services also use the term to subhead their company trade name, or they use the phrase as a subheading for public relations materials.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to business card software, many printing firms now offer a <b>web-to-print</b> service, {{which allows the}} customer to choose from a selection of stock design templates, customize online using their own logos and imagery, select quantities, view pricing options and request them for delivery to home or business addresses. Often this process is applied not only to business cards, but also to letterheads, notepads, labels and compliments slips.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} {{vision of}} the project has been to create an open database of Jewish liturgy and liturgy related work [...] "contemporary and historic, familiar and obscure, in every language Jews speak or have ever spoken" [...] {{and to create a}} web application suitable for accessing this database which can serve text for <b>web-to-print</b> publishing. Since 2009, the project has been actively developing an open XML workflow for digital publishing.|$|E
50|$|The Open Siddur Project (פרויקט הסידור הפתוח, IPA: pʁojeqt hassidduʁ hapatuaħ) is an open-source, <b>web-to-print</b> {{publishing}} and digital humanities project intent on sharing the semantic data of Jewish liturgy and liturgy-related work with free-culture compatible copyright licenses and Public Domain dedications. The project collaborates with other efforts in open-source Judaism in sharing content and code, advocates among related user-generated content projects to adopt Open Content licensing, and solicits copyright owners of related liturgical materials {{to share their}} work under free-culture compatible terms.|$|E
50|$|Another {{model of}} {{database}} publishing {{is found in}} many <b>web-to-print</b> sites where users browse templates from an online catalog (such as business cards or brochures), personalize the selected template by filling in a form and then view the rendered result. In this case the initial source of data is from user input, but it is captured in a database so that if the same user revisits the site later, they can resume editing where they left off. The form is then pre-filled from the database-stored variables the user entered before.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2003 Quark released a server version of QuarkXPress, called QuarkDDS. This enables page editing and page layout in a web browser. QuarkXPress Server is often used for <b>web-to-print</b> in corporate intranets to enable customization and ordering of printed materials, advertising automation workflows in advertising agencies, catalog generation for retailers and variable digital printing for personalized marketing. It enables companies to print copies digitally when they need them, often with customized content. The system relies on XML. The server is often embedded in print on demand software.|$|E
50|$|Advantages {{to the use}} of a <b>web-to-print</b> system {{include the}} ability for print houses, graphic designers, {{corporate}} clients, and the general public to access a private or public online catalog where last-minute changes to a prepress template are possible. Within this process, the client can approve the materials without the need for a face-to-face meeting with the printer. Additionally, templates allow print customers to control brand management and content, as portions of a constantly used template can remain consistent throughout a series of print projects. This system is often cost-effective for clients and time-effective for print houses.|$|E
5000|$|Library of the Printed Web is a {{physical}} archive devoted to <b>web-to-print</b> artists’ books, zines and other printout matter. Founded by Paul Soulellis in 2013, the collection was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art Library in January 2017. The project {{has been described as}} [...] "web culture articulated as printed artifact," [...] an [...] "archive of archives," [...] characterized as an [...] "accumulation of accumulations," [...] much of it printed on demand. Techniques for appropriating web content used by artists in the collection include grabbing, hunting, scraping and performing, detailed by Soulellis in [...] "Search, Compile, Publish," [...] and later referenced by Alessandro Ludovico.|$|E
50|$|The first {{versions}} of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names {{as the basis}} for their color lists, as both started as X Window System applications.Web colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition, sRGB, which relates the chromaticities of a particular phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions, in order to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without color management. User agents vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for <b>Web-to-print</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|Printed Web is an artists' {{publication}} {{devoted to}} <b>web-to-print</b> art and discourse, published by Paul Soulellis / Library of the Printed Web. The project began in 2014 {{as a way}} to present new work by artists included in Soulellis’ Library of the Printed Web. Artists are invited to submit new or existing network-based work for the printed page. In the spirit of Seth Siegelaub, each issue is curated as a group exhibition for the printed page. Printed Web circulates primarily as print-on-demand publications, but also includes PDFs, ZIPs, GIFs, and server directories. More than 180 artists and writers have contributed to the project through issue #4. Individual issues are widely held in special artists’ publications collections and libraries, including Museum of Modern Art NY, Yale University, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Center, and NY Public Library.|$|E
5000|$|Soulellis is {{the founder}} of Library of the Printed Web, a {{physical}} archive devoted to <b>web-to-print</b> artists' books, zines and other printout matter. The Printed Web project [...] "embraces the fluid movement between material and digital realms that characterizes our age." [...] He curates, designs and publishes print-on-demand publications that have featured the work of over 180 contemporary artists. According to Soulellis, Printed Web artists [...] "'perform publishing' by investigating multiple materialities and design possibilities as their works travel through the network." [...] Soulellis also maintains his own artist's practice centered on independent publishing. His work is widely held in special artists' books collections at art and research institutions, including Museum of Modern Art, NY; Walker Art Center, MN; Yale University, CT; Reykjavík Art Museum, Iceland; The Living Art Museum, Iceland; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Hochschule Hof Bibliothek, Germany; Brooklyn Museum, NY; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA; and New York Public Library, NY.|$|E

Meanwhile, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. [...] "The object of the game, for me," [...] Rushkoff explained, [...] "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition." ...|$|E
