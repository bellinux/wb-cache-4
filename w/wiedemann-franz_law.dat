40|$|We report our {{investigations}} on the finite-size {{effects of}} the Lorenz number in a molecular wire. Using Landauer-Büttiker formalism, we find that for sufficiently long wires there are two validity regimes of the <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> (WF) <b>law,</b> the cotunneling and the sequential tunneling regimes, while in small systems only the first regime survives. We compare our results with the standard Kubo formalism and explain its failure to detect the WF law in small systems. Furthermore, our studies on exponentially localized disordered wires show that the Lorenz number value L_ 0 predicted by the WF law is obtained only in the cotunneling regime. Also, the Lorenz number L exhibits a typical distribution at different temperatures corresponding to different tunneling process.

40|$|The celebrated <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> (WF) <b>law</b> is {{believed}} to be robust in metals as long as interactions between electrons preserve their fermion-quasiparticle character. We study thermal transport and the fate of the WF law close to a continuous metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) using cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Surprisingly, as for electrical transport, we find robust and novel quantum critical scaling in thermal transport across the MIT. We unearth the deeper reasons for these novel findings in terms of (i) the specific structure of energy-current correlations for the FKM and (ii) the microscopic electronic processes which facil- itate energy transport while simultaneously blocking charge transport close to the MIT. However, within (C) DMFT, we also find that the WF law survives at T= 0 in the incoherent metal right up to the MIT, even in absence of Landau quasiparticles. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} the <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> (WF) <b>law</b> in disordered but metallic cuprates, the low-temperature charge and heat transport properties are carefully studied for a series of impurity-substituted and carrier-overdoped La_ 1. 8 Sr_ 0. 2 Cu_ 1 -zM_zO_ 4 (M = Zn or Mg) single crystals. With moderate impurity substitution concentrations of z = 0. 049 and 0. 082 (M = Zn), the resistivity shows a clear metallic behavior at low temperature and the WF law is confirmed to be valid. With increasing impurity concentration to z = 0. 13 (M = Zn) or 0. 15 (M = Mg), the resistivity shows a low-T upturn but its temperature dependence indicates a finite conductivity in the T → 0 limit. In this weakly-localized metallic state that is intentionally achieved in the overdoped regime, a negative departure from the WF law is found, which is opposite to the theoretical expectation.

40|$|Recently, {{enhancement}} of the longitudinal magneto-electrical conductivity (LMEC) {{has been observed}} in Bi_ 1 -xSb_x around x ∼ 3 % under E∥B (E: external electric field and B: external magnetic field) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 246603 (2013) ], where an enhancement factor proportional to B^ 2 is suggested to result from the E·B term. In the present study, we show that this B^ 2 enhancement is not limited on the LMEC, where both the Seebeck and thermal conductivities in the longitudinal setup (E∥B) are predicted to show essentially the same enhancement proportional to B^ 2. In particular, the B^ 2 enhancement factor of the LMEC turns out to differ {{from that of the}} longitudinal thermal conductivity, responsible for breakdown of <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> (WF) <b>law,</b> which means that anomalous currents flowing through the dissipationless channel differ from each other. Since the breakdown of the WF law appears in spite of the existence of electron quasiparticles, regarded to be a purely topological character (chiral anomaly), the Weyl metallic state cannot be identified with the Landau's Fermi-liquid fixed point.

40|$|A quantum {{critical}} point (QCP) arises at a continuous transition between competing phases at zero temperature. Collective excitations at magnetic QCPs {{give rise to}} metallic properties that strongly deviate from the expectations of Landau's Fermi liquid description, the standard theory of electron correlations in metals. Central to this theory {{is the notion of}} quasiparticles, electronic excitations which possess the quantum numbers of the bare electrons. Here we report measurements of thermal and electrical transport across the field-induced magnetic QCP in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh$_ 2 $Si$_ 2 $. We show that the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities at the zero-temperature limit obeys the <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> (WF) <b>law</b> above the critical field, $B_c$. This is also expected at $B < B_c$, where weak antiferromagnetic order and a Fermi liquid phase form below 0. 07 K ($B = 0 $). However, at the critical field the low-temperature electrical conductivity suggests a non-Fermi-liquid ground state and exceeds the thermal conductivity by about 10 %. This apparent violation of the WF law provides evidence for an unconventional type of QCP at which the fundamental concept of Landau quasiparticles breaks down. These results imply that Landau quasiparticles break up, and that the origin of this disintegration is inelastic scattering associated with electronic quantum critical fluctuations. Our finding brings new insights into understanding deviations from Fermi-liquid behaviour frequently observed in various classes of correlated materials.

It can be shown by using the <b>Wiedemann-Franz</b> <b>law,</b> that the thermal conduction is phonon-dominated.
