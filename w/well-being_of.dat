40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} {{theoretical}} debates about child well-being and introduces the structural model <b>of</b> child <b>well-being.</b> The development <b>of</b> the model has {{its origins in}} the great diversity <b>of</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> in the research field. The model {{is based on the}} definition of health by the World Health Organisation (WHO 1946), the bioecological theory of child development (Bronfenbrenner and Morris 1998), social support theory (Cobb 1976), and the socio-cultural approach to human development (Vygotsky 1962; Leont’ev 1978). The general frame of the model is founded on the new paradigm of childhood, especially the notion of the child as an active social actor. The model analyzes child well-being as a construct which is made up <b>of</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> at the individual level and framed by preconditions <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> at both individual and societal levels. The dimensions <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> are physical, mental, social, and material, while the frame <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> consists <b>of</b> subjective action, a circle of care, the structures of society, and culture. The relationships between the different elements are also included in the model. The paper concludes with a discussion on the model as a whole...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the correlates <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> at midlife in 49 midlife adults. Self-report measures of generativity, agency and communion, along with relevant themes taken from narratives were considered as predictors of Ryff's multidimensional model <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and <b>of</b> life satisfaction. Multiple regressions identified generative concern as a predictor <b>of</b> the six <b>well-being</b> dimensions and <b>of</b> life satisfaction. A separate series of multiple regressions identified narrative themes of contamination, redemption, and affect tone as predictors of four <b>of</b> the <b>well-being</b> dimensions and <b>of</b> life satisfaction.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the very topical theme <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> Its aims are (1) to explore the {{personality}} context of the three most commonly used concepts <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> - subjective, psychological well-being and self-esteem, (2) to confirm the connection <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> with personality traits and to contribute to clarifying other personality contexts that the research sounds ambiguous - with values, identity styles, and coping strategies, and (3) find different patterns of relationships of individual concepts <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> with measured variables, thus confirming the uniqueness of these constructs. The methods used include the calculation of correlation coefficients between individual concepts <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and all other variables and the calculation of differences by correlating other variables with all three pairs <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> concepts. The results largely confirmed expectations. The weakest relationships with personality variables were found in subjective well-being, operationalized as life satisfaction. Life satisfaction was most predicted by stability, commitment, and extraversion. Psychological well-being was most predicted by commitment, stability, extraversion, conscientiousness, and a negative diffusion style of identity.

40|$|Summary. - It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that {{per capita income}} is not an adequate indicator <b>of</b> aggregate <b>well-being.</b> It has thus become customary to use a range of socioeconomic indices for assessing {{the quality of life}} in a society. In this article we extend measures <b>of</b> general <b>well-being</b> in current use by including ordinal indices of political and civil liberties, and we provide a ranking of the world’s poorest countries on the basis of the Borda Rule. We then compare improvements in socioeconomic performance with the availability of political and civil liberties during the decade of the 1970 s and observe that improvements in per capita national income. life expectancy at birth, and infant mortality are positively correlated with the extent of political and civil liberties enjoyed by citizens, while improvements in literacy are negatively correlated with these liberties. 1. PLURAL MEASURES <b>OF</b> <b>WELL-BEING</b> Measures <b>of</b> the quality of life can take one of two forms: they can reflect the constituents <b>of</b> <b>well-being,</b> or alternatively, they can be mea-sures of the access people have to the determi-nants <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> Indices <b>of</b> health, welfare...|$|R
40|$|Some {{believe that}} the harm or benefit of {{existence}} is assessed by comparing a person’s actual state <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> with the level <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> {{they would have had}} had they never existed. This approach relies on ascribing a state or level <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> to “nonexistent people,” which seems a peculiar practice: how can we attribute well-being to a “nonexistent person”? To explain away this oddity, some have argued that because no properties <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> can be attributed to “nonexistent people” such people may be ascribed a neutral or zero level <b>of</b> <b>well-being,</b> setting the baseline for comparatively assessing the harm or benefit of coming into existence. However, this line of argumentation conflates the category <b>of</b> having zero <b>well-being</b> with the category <b>of</b> having no <b>well-being.</b> No Ф, unlike a zero level of Ф, is not comparable to levels of Ф – neutral, positive, or negative. Considering the nature <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and the fact that “nonexistent people” cannot (metaphysically or conceptually) have well-being determinative properties, it follows that “nonexistent people” have no well-being rather than zero well-being...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{undermine}} a basic assumption <b>of</b> theories <b>of</b> <b>well-being,</b> one that I call well-being invariabilism. I argue that much of what makes existing theories <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> inadequate stems from the invariabilist assumption. After distinguishing and explaining well-being invariabilism and well-being variabilism, I show that the most widely-held theories of well-being—hedonism, desire-satisfaction, and pluralist objective-list theories—presuppose invariabilism and that a large class of the objections to them arise because of it. My aim is to show that abandoning invariabilism and adopting variabilism is a sensible first step for those aiming to formulate more plausible theories <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> After considering objections to my argument, I explain what a variabilist theory <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> would be like and show that well-being variabilism need not be any threat to the project of formulating theories <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> that deliver general principles concerning well-being enhancement...|$|R
