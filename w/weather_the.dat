5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good <b>weather,</b> <b>the</b> crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad <b>weather</b> <b>the</b> trip remained uncertain.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet <b>weather,</b> <b>the</b> airbase was completed and proved useful.

5|$|Because {{of the bad}} <b>weather,</b> <b>the</b> B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe <b>weather.</b> <b>The</b> Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
