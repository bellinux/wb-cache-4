The weather radar wind profiles (WRWPs) are retrieved using the well-known volume velocity processing (VVP) technique. The X-band bird radar performed range–height scans perpendicular to the main migration direction and bird densities were deduced by counting and normalizing the observed echoes. It is found that the radial velocity standard deviation (� r) obtained from the VVP retrieval is a skillful indicator of bird migration. Using a threshold of 2 ms � 1 on � r, more than 93 % of the bird-contaminated <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> are rejected while over 70 % of the true <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> are accepted correctly.

The problem is partitioned into estimating wind speed and wind direction. Wind speed is modelled using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a sum of squares error function. Wind direction is a periodic variable and a multi-valued function for a given set of inputs; a conventional MLP fails at this task, and so we model the full periodic probability density of direction conditioned on the satellite derived inputs using a Mixture Density Network (MDN) with periodic kernel functions.
