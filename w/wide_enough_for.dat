5|$|The {{neighbouring}} Russell {{family of}} Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when {{the lake was}} built, and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge had to be jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie. It was <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> carriages on the Pitfour side but too narrow on the Russell's half.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E

60|$|Rollo was right; for the walk, {{instead of}} {{coming to an end}} at the {{extremity}} of the point which separated the two rivers, was continued along a little dike or embankment which seemed to have been made artificially some distance down between the two streams. This dike was very narrow, being just <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> indeed <b>for</b> a narrow footpath.|$|R

25|$|A second platform, for an {{extension}} of the siding, or a full-blown second track, was originally planned for the station. The pedestrian bridge is <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> this extra construction, and the bridge's stairway {{on the far side of}} the station has a landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform, symmetrical with the landing on the other side which is part of the existing platform. A ticket window was proposed to be established but it has yet to occur.|$|E
25|$|Victoria Hall {{was a large}} {{concert hall}} on Toward Road facing Mowbray Park. The hall {{was the scene of}} a tragedy on 16 June 1883 when 183 {{children}} died. During a variety show, children rushed towards a staircase for treats. At the bottom of the staircase, the door had been opened inward and bolted {{in such a way as}} to leave only a gap <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> one child to pass at a time. The children surged down the stairs and those at the front were trapped and crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them.|$|E

25|$|The {{slim and}} compact {{fuselage}} {{of the aircraft}} was quite cramped, <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> only <b>for</b> a single person. The navigator sat behind the pilot and access in the cockpit required folding down the seats. Once in place, the crew had almost no room to move and were typically uncomfortable during long missions. Aircrews referred to the Hampden by various nicknames due to this, such as Flying Suitcase, Panhandle, and Flying Tadpole.|$|R
25|$|Shoelaces, {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the five main gates several posterns in the wall existed, only <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a person, each surmounted by a manned tower. Known examples are Low Gate in the north wall, {{and at the end}} of the streets Posterngate, and Blackfriargate (Blanket Row) on the western walls. In the 16thcentury John Leland stated that there were over twenty towers in the circuit of the walls; the exact number is unknown, early maps show up to 30 towers in total. After Henry VIII's visit in 1541 all entrances except the main gates, as well a North and Hessle gate were ordered to be walled up.|$|E
25|$|The Taos Mountain Trail was the {{historic}} pathway for trade and business exchanges between agrarian Taos (New Mexico) and the Great Plains (Colorado) from pre-history (1100 A.D.) through the Spanish Colonial period {{and into the}} time of the European and American presence. The Taos Mountain Trail, between northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, connected the high mountain traders and their trading partners north and south of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Also called the Trapper's Trail, the pathway was only <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> people on foot or horses in single file, but it shortened a trip from Taos to the plains farther north from nearly two weeks to three days in good weather. The Taos Mountain Trail was also known as the Sangre de Cristo Trail and the Aztec Trail.|$|E

25|$|East of the New Cross Gate railway {{tracks the}} railway land {{continues}} to be <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the SCR to have passed with only limited demolition works required as it headed towards Lewisham town centre. At Lewisham the SCR would have merged with a spur from the north-west that was planned to run 0.75 miles along the New Cross railway line to end at a junction on New Cross Road (A2). The SCR would have crossed to {{the north side of}} the railway to skirt the town centre passing through industrial and commercial areas and crossing over the route now occupied by the Docklands Light Railway. Residential demolitions would have been required at the west end of Granville Park to clear the path but the route was then clear to Blackheath station.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Mounted Division {{crossed the}} Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh on a pontoon bridge just <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> one vehicle or two horses abreast. Then, {{led by the}} 4th Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General William Grant) the {{division}} advanced rapidly northwards to Jisr ed Damieh; the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Lachlan Wilson) continuing on to ride hard from Jisr ed Damieh to capture Es Salt. Meanwhile, the 4th Light Horse Brigade supported by at least two Royal Horse Artillery batteries took up their position of flank guard astride the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt road facing north-west opposite a strong German and Ottoman position holding the bridge over the Jordan River. The 5th Mounted Brigade (Brigadier General Philip Kelly) followed by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Granville Ryrie) moved towards Es Salt along the Umm esh Shert track. They were followed later by the 1st Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Charles Cox) which remained across the track as guard for a time.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of the forecastle in the early 15th century marked the third phase of Trakai's development. The walls of the forecastle were strengthened to a thickness of 2.5 metres and raised with additional firing galleries. Three major defensive towers were constructed on the corners. The southwestern tower was also used as a prison. The top story of the towers was designed for soldiers and housed {{a large number of}} cannons. A main gatehouse was also constructed which, along with the Ducal Palace donjon, had movable gates. The gatehouse was reinforced with additional sections for firing galleries. Near the inner walls several buildings were constructed, including stables, kitchens, and other support structures. When the castle was undergoing this expansion in the 15th century, the water level of Lake Galvė was several metres higher than it is today. The castle builders took advantage of this by separating the Ducal Palace and the forecastle with a moat, just <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> small boats to sail through. They were connected by gates that could be raised in case of an enemy attack.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to select a suitable separation solvent {{for this type of}} distillation. The solvent must alter the relative volatility by a <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> margin <b>for</b> a successful result. The quantity, cost and availability of the solvent should be considered. The solvent should be easily separable from the bottom product, and should not react chemically with the components or the mixture, or cause corrosion in the equipment. A classic example to be cited here is the separation of an azeotropic mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, where aniline is one suitable solvent.|$|R

25|$|The current station {{house was}} rebuilt around 1910, {{although}} some sources claim {{it was in}} 1927. Regardless of the correct date, it was designed {{in a manner similar}} to stations such as those in Riverhead, Bay Shore, Manhasset, and Mineola. It also served as the south end of a trolley Line into Northport from 1902 to 1924. A freight house from Camp Upton was moved to Northport Station in April 1922, after the railroad station there was dismantled. High-level platforms and a pedestrian bridge were added during the late-20th Century. Northport Station features two large parking lots. One south of the tracks and the biggest is north of the tracks. A pedestrian bridge is set up between the lots. It is <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the after mentioned south platform to be constructed. Northport is one of the most elaborate LIRR stations. the current station is just east of the Northport Spur, which branched off the main and headed north to the seaport village of Northport, even though the Northport Station is in East Northport. The spur has not seen a passenger train since 1899. Afterward, the spur was entirely used for freight service. freight service ended in 1978. The track lay abandoned until 1985, when it was torn up in preparation for the unbuilt Babylon Northport Expressway.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{progress}} of the relief force had been slowed by several factors including flooding from the heavy rain, Viet Cong action, poor equipment, limited communications and an ambiguous command relationship between the armour and infantry. Although normally having a strength of 13 APCs, 3 Troop had been reduced to just seven, with the remainder undergoing maintenance, while many of those available suffered from mechanical problems and obsolete radios. As a consequence they were augmented by three vehicles from 2 Troop, although these lacked gun shields, leaving the crew commander exposed. Mounted in the carriers, 100 men from A Company 6 RAR departed Nui Dat under command of Mollison, with orders to relieve the pressure on D Company by attacking from the south and then to reinforce them and secure the area to allow the evacuation of the wounded. However, with there relatively few gaps in the Nui Dat perimeter <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the APCs, Roberts was forced to take a circuitous route south-east through the base. On arrival he found the exit had moved due to road works being carried out by the engineers, and this resulted in further delay until an alternative was located. At 17:55, after finally clearing the wire, Roberts was ordered to send two APCs back for Townsend and to wait until he came up, as he intended to accompany the carriers rather than move by helicopter. Detaching two APCs, Roberts ignored {{the second part of the}} order and the remainder of the troop proceeded, leaving Nui Dat at 18:00.|$|E
25|$|Before {{her next}} voyage, a {{virtually}} new crew had been signed on - {{of the crew}} of 47, only eight men {{had been on the}} previous voyage. This eight included Captain Grimstone and his three deck officers, the mate John Elliot, William Hickson the gun layer, two other gunners and the ship steward. On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late afternoon she had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was <b>wide</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who knew how to get the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and around the top of Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were forced draught fed, required the booster fans to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this. The captain was told by the commodore aboard the Vesper that if she could not regain her position in the convoy by nightfall she should make for harbour at one of the east coast ports.|$|E
