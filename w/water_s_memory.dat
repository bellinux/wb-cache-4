40|$|It is {{well known}} that two types of {{gravitational}} wave memory exist in general relativity (GR) : the linear memory and the non-linear, or Christodoulou memory. These effects, especially the latter, depend on the specific form of Einstein equation. It can then be speculated that in modified theories of gravity, the memory can differ from the GR prediction, and provides novel phenomena to study these theories. We support this speculation by considering scalar-tensor theories, for which we find two new types of memory: the T <b>memory</b> and the <b>S</b> <b>memory,</b> which contribute to the tensor and scalar components of gravitational wave, respectively. In particular, the former is caused by the burst of energy carried away by scalar radiation, while the latter is intimately related to the no scalar hair property of black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. We estimate the size of these two types of memory in gravitational collapses, and formulate a detection strategy for the <b>S</b> <b>memory,</b> which can be singled out from tensor gravitational waves. We show that (i) the <b>S</b> <b>memory</b> exists even in spherical symmetry, and is observable under current model constraints, and (ii) while the T memory is usually much weaker than the <b>S</b> <b>memory,</b> it can become comparable in the case of spontaneous scalarization.

40|$|Controversy exists {{over the}} {{relationship}} between experiencing a subjectively distressing, or 2 ̆ 7 traumatic 7, event and one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>memory</b> for it. Divergent findings from autobiographical memory studies {{have given rise to}} a debate concerning the nature of traumatic memory. Although discrepant findings may be accounted for by differing methodologies, {{it is more likely that}} they reflect the variability of trauma 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> association with <b>memory.</b> Factors relating to both the individual and to the type of event that is experienced interact in influencing a person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>memory</b> for that experience. The focus of the present study was to compare reports of memory clarity across emotionally distressing, emotionally positive, and non-emotional autobiographical events. In addition, individual difference factors were also examined in relation to memory clarity. The results indicate that factors related to both event type and individual differences are associated with one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>memory</b> for that event, and are discussed in relation to the forensic arena...|$|R

40|$|Up to day, drip {{irrigation}} systems have reached {{to a high}} level of technology. But, these systems are not able to show their potential benefits, due to various reasons. Emitter clogging can affect distribution uniformity and the system performance, which has direct relationship with water quality. In this study five types of emitters with different nominal discharges, with or without self-flushing system and with or without pressure compensating system were evaluated under three management schemes; untreated well <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 1), acidic treated <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 2) and magnetic treated <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 3) in order to reduce chemical clogging. Flow reduction rate, statistical uniformity coefficient (Uc), emission uniformity coefficient (Eu) and variation coefficient of emitters’ performance in the field (Vf) were monitored. The emitter performance indexes (Uc and Eu) decreased during the experiment due to emitter clogging. The Uc and Eu values in different management schemes confirmed that the acidification has better performance than the magnetic water in order to control emitter clogging and keep high distribution uniformity.

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in legislation, {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s testimony in many jurisdictions can be presented differently {{to the way in}} which most adults’ testimony is presented. The present research was conducted to investigate whether the various ways in which children 2 ̆ 7 s testimony is given affects how child victims in cases of child sexual assault are perceived in terms of reliability and how their testimony is evaluated. We examined the effect of giving testimony in court via closed-circuit TV (CCTV), via a pre-recorded testimony, and a combination of the two. The results indicate that the timing of the recording of the testimony, and the presence of the child in court, did affect the use of stereotypes in ratings of the case. Stereotypes about children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>memories</b> had an effect when an early recording of the child 2 ̆ 7 s testimony was lacking and when the child did not appear in court.
