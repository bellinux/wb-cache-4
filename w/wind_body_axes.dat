Within the sensory epithelium, hair cells are polarized in a stereotyped manner, but the mechanisms that control their alignment relative to the <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> are unknown. We have found, however, that neuromasts can be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the anteroposterior body axis. By characterizing the strauss mutant zebrafish line and by tracking labeled cells, we have demonstrated that neuromasts of these two orientations originate from, respectively, the first and second primordia. Furthermore, altering the migratory pathway of a primordium reorients a neuromast's axis of planar polarity. We propose that the global {{orientation of}} hair cells relative to the <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> is established through an interaction between directional movement by primordial cells and the timing of neuromast maturation...|$|R

Here, we utilize the multicellular polyp Hydra to investigate {{the role of the}} actomyosin cytoskeleton in morphogenesis.

This form of structural inheritance is non-trivial because of the tissue folding and dynamic actin reorganization involved. We further show that the emergence of multiple <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> can be traced to discrepancies in actin fiber alignment at early stages of the regeneration process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{question}} of how the vertebrate embryo gives rise to a nervous system is of paramount interest in developmental biology. Neural induction constitutes the earliest step in this process and is tightly connected with development of the embryonic <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> In the Xenopus embryo, perpendicular gradients of BMP and Wnt signals pattern the dorsoventral and anteroposterior <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> Both pathways need to be inhibited to allow anterior neural induction to occur. FGF 8 and IGF are active neural inducers that together with BMP and Wnt signals are integrated at the level of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation.

40|$|Summary In {{addition}} to their ubiquitous apical-basal polarity, many epithelia are also polarized along an orthogonal axis, a phenomenon termed planar cell polarity (PCP). In the mammalian inner ear and the zebrafish lateral line, PCP is revealed through the orientation of mechanosensitive hair cells relative {{to each other and}} to the <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> In each neuromast, the receptor organ of the lateral line, hair bundles are arranged in a mirror-symmetrical fashion. Here we show that the establishment of mirror symmetry is preceded by rotational rearrangements between hair-cell pairs, a behavior consistently associated with the division of hair-cell precursors. Time-lapse imaging of trilobite mutants, which lack the core PCP constituent Vang-like protein 2 (Vangl 2), shows that their misoriented hair cells correlate with misaligned divisions of hair-cell precursors and an inability to complete rearrangements accurately. Vangl 2 is asymmetrically localized in the cells of the neuromast, a configuration required for accurate completion of rearrangements. Manipulation of Vangl 2 expression or of Notch signaling results in a uniform hair-cell polarity, indicating that rearrangements refine neuromast polarity with respect to the <b>body</b> <b>axes...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe anterior–posterior axis is a {{key feature}} of the bilaterian body plan. Although axis {{specification}} during embryogenesis has been studied extensively, virtually nothing is known about how this axis can be established post-embryonically, as occurs in budding animals. We investigated bud formation in the acoel Convolutriloba retrogemma, which reproduces by a remarkable process involving the formation of animals with linked but completely opposite <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> Reverse axes are established anew during each round of budding and manifestations of the bud's new axis develop gradually, with regionalization of axial patterning genes (Hox and otx) {{and the establishment of}} organized musculature occurring secondarily, after bud initiation. A swath of tissue at the parent–bud boundary has no regenerative potential and appears devoid of inherent axial polarity. GSK- 3 inhibitor trials suggest that Wnt/β-catenin or Hedgehog signalling may mediate the establishment of this unpolarized zone. Formation of unpolarized tissue may provide a buffer between opposing polarity cues and be a general mechanism by which budding animals establish and maintain linked <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> In addition to elucidating the developmental basis of budding in a bilaterian, this study provides insight into convergence in animal budding mechanisms, redeployment of embryonic gene expression during budding, and Hox gene evolution...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground : Wnt {{signaling}} {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} and most highly conserved regulatory pathways for the establishment of the <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> during regeneration and early development. In regeneration, <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> determination occurs independently of tissue rearrangement and early developmental cues. Modulation of the Wnt signaling in either process has shown to result in unusual body axis phenotypes. Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian that can regenerate its entire body through asexual budding. This processes leads to an adult body via a stereotypical developmental pathway (called blastogenesis), without proceeding through any embryonic developmental stages. Results : In this study, we describe the role of the canonical Wnt pathway during the early stages of asexual development. We characterized expression of three Wnt ligands (Wnt 2 B, Wnt 5 A, and Wnt 9 A) by in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR. Chemical manipulation of the pathway resulted in atypical budding due to the duplication of the A/P axes, supernumerary budding, and loss of the overall cell apical-basal polarity. Conclusions : Our results suggest that Wnt signaling is used for equivalent developmental processes both during embryogenesis and asexual development in an adult organism, suggesting that patterning mechanisms driving morphogenesis are conserved, independent of embryonic, or regenerative development...|$|R
