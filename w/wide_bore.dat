500|$|Archaeamphora longicervia was a {{herbaceous}} plant growing to around [...] in height. The stem, at least [...] long by [...] <b>wide,</b> <b>bore</b> distinctive vertical ridges and grooves. The pitcher-like structures were [...] {{in form and}} [...] long. Mature pitchers and underdeveloped pitchers or phyllodia-like leaves were arranged spirally around the stem. Pitchers consisted of a tubular base, expanded middle section, constriction around the mouth, and a vertical, spoon-shaped lid. A single wing ran down the [...] side of each pitcher. Three to five parallel major veins were present on the pitchers, {{along with a few}} intercostal veins and numerous small veinlets.|$|E
500|$|The four locks at Wootton Rivers {{mark the}} end of the climb from the Avon. Between Wootton Top Lock and Crofton is the summit pound of the canal at [...] above sea level, {{stretching}} for about [...] and including the [...] Bruce Tunnel. The tunnel is named after the local land owner, Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729–1814), who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has red brick portals, capped with Bath stone, each with a decorative plaque of Pennant stone. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with English bond brickwork and has a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk {{across the top of the}} hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls.|$|E
6000|$|A Highlander once {{fought a}} Frenchman at Margate, The weapons a rapier, a backsword, and target; Brisk Monsieur {{advanced}} {{as fast as}} he could, But all his fine pushes were caught in the wood; While Sawney with backsword did slash him and nick him, While t'other, enraged that he could not once prick him, Cried, [...] "Sirrah, you rascal, you son of a whore, Me'll fight you, begar, if you'll come from your door!" [...] Our case is the same; if you'll fight like a man, Don't fly from my weapon, and skulk behind Dan; For he's not to be pierced; his leather's so tough, The devil himself can't get through his buff. Besides, I cannot but say that it is hard, Not only to make him your shield, but your vizard; And like a tragedian, you rant and you roar, Through the horrible grin of your larva's <b>wide</b> <b>bore.</b> Nay, farther, which makes me complain much, and frump it, You make his long nose your loud speaking-trumpet; With the din of which tube my head you so bother, That I scarce can distinguish my right ear from t'other.|$|E
30|$|Centrifuge {{the tubes}} at 10, 000  rpm for 10  minutes at 4 °C and collect the {{supernatant}} in 1.5  ml centrifuge tube using <b>wide</b> <b>bored</b> tip.|$|R
50|$|All 330 models used an {{evolution}} of the 400 Superamerica's 4.0 L Colombo V12 engine. It was substantially changed, with <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> spacing and an alternator replacing a generator.|$|R
50|$|Cannulae {{with smaller}} prongs {{intended}} for infant or neonatal use can carry {{less than one}} litre per minute. Flow rates of up to 60 litres of air/oxygen per minute can be delivered through <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> humidified nasal cannula.|$|R

50|$|Ken LaCosse (born April 9, 1960 in San Jose, California) is an American {{maker of}} the shakuhachi (Japanese bamboo flute). He is known {{particularly}} for developing a large, <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> style of shakuhachi called Taimu, with input from shakuhachi player Brian Ritchie.|$|E
50|$|A 3.0L Mazda W-engine {{similar to}} the 2.5 is also used in the 2007 Ranger as {{the top of the}} range. Displacement is {{increased}} with a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> of 96mm and longer stroke of 102mm. It produces @3200 rpm and 380 Nm@1800 rpm.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the alto flute has a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> in {{relation}} to its tube length. This is to provide it with extra power in the bottom register, but this causes the alto problems with intonation and facility of sounding some notes in its top register.|$|R
50|$|Colombo had {{formerly}} designed Alfa Romeos for Enzo Ferrari. These V12 powerplants {{ranged from}} the diminutive 1.5 L (1497 cc) unit fitted to the 125S to the 4.9 L (4943 cc) unit in the 1986 412i. Significant updates were made in 1963 for the 330 series featuring a redesigned block with <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> spacing.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel has {{red brick}} portals, capped with Bath stone, {{each with a}} {{decorative}} plaque of Pennant stone. Construction was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with English bond brickwork and has a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> {{to cope with the}} 'Newbury Barges' used on this canal.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the basic}} {{principle}} of the heckelphone, the piccolo heckelphone in F has an extremely <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> with large tone holes. The angle of the instrument's conicity is quite wide (though not as wide {{as that of a}} saxophone), giving it a characteristically strong and powerful tone. The instrument is built in one section with a detachable bell, and has simple-system German fingering.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{types of}} {{canister}} were devised for specific models of artillery field pieces. In 1753, the [...] "secret howitzer", a special gun with an oval bore—intended to spread shot even wider—was briefly introduced into Russian service, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich, London, holds examples of two early 18th century experimental French <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> cannon—flattened tubes intended to scatter canister wide {{but in one}} horizontal plane.|$|E
5000|$|The contraforte (Kontraforte) is a {{proprietary}} instrument {{with a similar}} range to the contrabassoon produced by Benedikt Eppelsheim and Guntram Wolf. It is intended to have improved dynamics and intonation over the distinctive but sometimes reticent sound of the conventional contrabassoon. The contraforte uses a different and <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> than the contrabassoon to produce a distinct tone.|$|R
50|$|Although the 1963 330 series {{also used}} a 3967 cc engine {{with the same}} bore and stroke as the 400 Superamerica, this engine was quite different. It used a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> spacing, {{paving the way for}} future {{displacement}} increases. The spark plugs were moved and a new water pump was used. The dynamo on the prior versions was replaced by a true alternator. In the end, 300 hp (223 kW) was on tap.|$|R
50|$|The 3S is a 1998 cc L {{inline-four}} engine {{with an iron}} {{block and}} an alloy head. While based on the 2S engine of very similar displacement, Toyota went through the trouble of changing the long stroke dimensions of the 2S, giving it a 2 mm <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> and a 4 mm shorter stroke, allowing for the fitment of larger valves and enabling higher power outputs. First introduced in May 1984, the 3S remained in production until 2007.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{two-thirds of}} the Redmond hospital’s Radiology Department and the Family Birthing Center (FBC) lobby was renovated to {{accommodate}} this new technology — a 1.5 Tesla <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> MRI — which has an open bore system that helps patients feel less closed in. The MRI, which can handle patients who weigh up to 500 pounds, has an opening of almost 2.3 feet in diameter to provide a full foot of space over a patient’s head.|$|E
50|$|A snorkel enables {{players to}} watch the {{progress}} of the game without having to lift their head from the water to breathe. This allows them to keep their position on the surface, ready to resume play once they have recovered. In order to maximise the efficiency of breathing and reduce drag underwater snorkels are often short with a <b>wide</b> <b>bore,</b> and may include a drain valve. They must not be rigid or have any unnecessarily acute edges or points.|$|E
50|$|On 25 August 2012, an Indian {{national}} {{construction worker}} died after {{falling into a}} 68 m deep bore hole at the Tuas West Extension worksite near the station. The body of the worker was recovered the next day, almost 24 hours later. Preliminary findings revealed that the workers {{were in the process}} of lowering a rebar cage when it got dislodged from its lifting chains and dragged the 30-year-old worker into a 1.5 m <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> hole.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{confusion}} {{exists between}} the bass oboe and the Heckelphone, a double reed instrument of similar register introduced by the firm of Wilhelm Heckel in 1904, and which is distinguished from standard members of the oboe family by its <b>wider</b> <b>bore,</b> different fingering system (on older instruments), and larger bell. As a result, {{it is not always}} clear in English orchestral works of the early 20th century which of the two instruments is intended when the composer requests [...] "bass oboe".|$|R
25|$|A further {{refinement}} to the facelift {{range was}} via the two GX models, with a 3mm <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> in the throttle body (increased from 60mm to 63mm and mated to the plenum bore), helping {{to provide the}} additional 10PS over the earlier GR model engine. Whilst the GR model only continued to offer 4-speed auto and 5-speed manual into the 'facelift' era, the GX Sport and GX Sport Aero upgrade came either as 5-speed manual or 5-speed auto. On the GS and GR models aircon operation became manual from Feb 1997.|$|R
50|$|The heckelphone is {{a double}} reed {{instrument}} of the oboe family, but with a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> and hence a heavier and more penetrating tone. It is pitched an octave below the oboe and furnished with an additional semitone taking its range down to A. It was intended to provide a broad oboe-like sound in the middle register of the swollen orchestrations of {{the turn of the}} twentieth century. In the orchestral repertoire it is generally used as the bass of an oboe section incorporating the oboe and the cor anglais (English horn), filling the gap between the oboes and bassoons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{air vents}} that {{run along the}} line of the tunnel and provide ventilation, and a shaft of light into the canal, are known by the locals as [...] "pepper pots", because of their shape. They are brick-lined and the {{openings}} are covered by an iron frame or grill. The <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> and good ventilation mean that boats using the tunnel today are allowed to use the power of their internal combustion engines, which is prohibited in the narrower Dudley Tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{version of}} the fire arrow was known as bo-hiya. Japanese pirates (wokou also, kaizoku or wako) in the 16th century were {{reported}} to have used bo hiya which had the appearance of a large arrow. A burning element made from incendiary waterproof rope was wrapped around the shaft and when lit the bo-hiya was fired from a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> tanegashima (Japanese matchlock) or a mortar-like weapon (hiya taihou). During one sea battle it was said the bo-hiya were [...] "falling like rain".|$|E
5000|$|One {{instrument}} maker whose designs went in {{the opposite}} direction, utilizing a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> design, was the highly regarded German maker Karl Friedrich Golde (1803-1873) from Dresden. His ideal oboe sound contained a deep, rich, warm tonality: [...] "a powerful depth and a full sound will be achieved, … not a thin, nasal sound, like the French and Viennese Koch oboes.” Ironically, {{just a few years}} after his death his design would supplant the Koch oboe and become the new Wiener Oboe of the 20th Century.|$|E
5000|$|Appearing {{in early}} 1956, Abarth's 750 Gran Turismo Derivazione {{was the first}} Abarth product to use the {{standard}} Fiat bodywork. Fiat delivered these cars incomplete, {{to make it easier}} and more cost effective for Abarth to carry out their performance modifications. Rather than the 633 cc original or Abarth's own 710 cc model, the engine now displaced 747 cc thanks to a one millimetre <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> and a stroke increased by four millimetres (1 and 4 mm respectively). Sharper cams, lighter flywheel, a bigger carburetor, and a myriad other traditional tuning tricks were employed; as a result power nearly doubled, up from [...] Claimed top speed was 80 mph.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} instrument sound. Major effects are due {{to the shape of}} the cup, shape of the throat, and the inner rim diameter. In addition, players often choose a mouthpiece that complements their playing styles. In general, brass players who concentrate on the upper range prefer a mouthpiece with a narrow bore, and players who emphasize the lower range prefer a <b>wider</b> <b>bore.</b> The cup depth also heavily influences the tone of the brass instrument. A shallow cup will brighten the sound, which is good for trumpeters doing a solo, while the deep cups darken the sound, which is better for blending in with an orchestra.|$|R
50|$|At present, {{geothermal}} wells {{are rarely}} more than 3 km deep. Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells {{as deep as}} 10 km. Drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry, although it is an expensive process. The deepest research well in the world, the Kola superdeep borehole, is 12.3 km (7.6 mi) deep. This record has recently been imitated by commercial oil wells, such as Exxon's Z-12 well in the Chayvo field, Sakhalin. Wells drilled to depths greater than 4 km generally incur drilling costs {{in the tens of}} millions of dollars. The technological challenges are to drill <b>wide</b> <b>bores</b> at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock.|$|R
50|$|The F {{attachment}} {{originated in}} an instrument developed by German instrument maker Christian Friedrich Sattler {{during the late}} 1830s and patented in 1839. It gained popularity {{at a time when}} the older German E and F bass trombones had fallen out of favour with orchestral players and were being replaced by a B tenor trombone with a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> and large bell proportions. This instrument was known as the tenorbass trombone (German Tenorbassposaune)—it was a tenor trombone in B with the bore and bell dimensions of a bass trombone, and was used to play both tenor and bass trombone parts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{instrument}} is typically of metal construction, with a conical and unusually <b>wide</b> <b>bore.</b> This width allows each note {{to be produced}} by opening only one tone hole, whereas, in other woodwind instruments, several tone holes must be opened to produce most notes (for this reason, all keys but that for the lowest note remain normally closed). This property greatly simplifies the fingering of the instrument, in that no alternative fingerings for individual notes or trill keys are needed, nor exist. The lowest note that the reed contrabass may typically achieve is D1 (DD) - the lowest D on a standard grand piano.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeamphora longicervia was a {{herbaceous}} plant growing to around 50 mm in height. The stem, at least 21 mm long by 1.2 mm <b>wide,</b> <b>bore</b> distinctive vertical ridges and grooves. The pitcher-like structures were [...] {{in form and}} 30 to 40 mm long. Mature pitchers and underdeveloped pitchers or phyllodia-like leaves were arranged spirally around the stem. Pitchers consisted of a tubular base, expanded middle section, constriction around the mouth, and a vertical, spoon-shaped lid. A single wing ran down the [...] side of each pitcher. Three to five parallel major veins were present on the pitchers, {{along with a few}} intercostal veins and numerous small veinlets.|$|E
50|$|In early December 2014, Deutsche Bahn {{provided}} updated {{details of}} the procurement of the two tunnel boring machines. The two 90 metre-long and 1,750 t machines would be provided by Herrenknecht AG. The first machine would now be assembled in September 2015 and the excavation would begin in December 2015. The assembly of the second machine would begin in early January 2016 and the excavation would begin in April 2016. With a 10.97 m <b>wide</b> <b>boring</b> shield, each TBM would prepare a usable section of 9.6 m. The contract for the two machines {{was estimated to be}} worth €36 million. The structure of the tunnel was still estimated to be completed {{in the first quarter of}} 2018.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{variant of}} the M20 engine was Alpina's C2. The first C2 combined the <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> of the M20B25 with the slightly larger 76.8 mm crankshaft of an M20B23, to create a torquier engine of 2552 cc. This version put out [...] and 265 Nm, 74 units were built between 1985 and November 1986. After the C2 2.7 appeared {{in the spring of}} 1986, the 2.5 was slightly upgraded and gained five horsepower. However, to indicate its [...] "little brother" [...] position in the lineup, the name was changed to C1 2.5. When the September 1987 facelift model of the E30 was introduced, the 2.5 litre C1 was discontinued, although a few cars were finished into 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The tubax has had {{debate over}} whether it is really in the {{saxophone}} family. Its bore is not as wide as other saxophones that size are, and the tubing is very thin compared to other saxes. Some authorities classify it as its own family of instruments, while others consider it in the saxophone family. Also, the tubax {{is a lot like}} a double reed instrument family called a sarrusophone. The sarrusophone's range is the same as a saxophone, while some have a high G, though the tubax has a much <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> compared to the latter instrument. Lastly, the tubax's sound is a little bit [...] "honkier" [...] than the average saxophone.|$|R
