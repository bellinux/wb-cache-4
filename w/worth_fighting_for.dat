5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is <b>worth</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for.</b> Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides {{to live in a}} world without fear.|$|E

However, still a significant majority of the studies focusing on the need to take account of cultural factors in the analysis of war is produced not in the field of cultural studies, but by the Western military and strategic analysts.

Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune praises Lee's [...] "rich use of language" [...] but writes that the central lesson is that [...] "courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style". Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book [...] "still rouses fresh and horrified indignation" [...] as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with [...] "a fiercely progressive ink, {{in which there is}} nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question", comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen, stating the book's central theme, that [...] "one’s moral convictions are <b>worth</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for,</b> even at the risk of being reviled" [...] is eloquently discussed.|$|E
