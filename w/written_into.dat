5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral lesson was noted. Adrift, like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter <b>written</b> <b>into</b> a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be <b>written</b> <b>into</b> those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state constitutional amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, {{though some of the}} amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the state constitutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E

25|$|Although Windows 9x {{features}} memory protection, it {{does not}} protect the first megabyte of memory from userland applications. This area of memory contains code critical to {{the functioning of the}} operating system, and by <b>writing</b> <b>into</b> this area of memory an application can crash or freeze the operating system. This was a source of instability as faulty applications could accidentally <b>write</b> <b>into</b> this region and with that halt the operating system.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, it {{is common}} for multiple threads to simultaneously access the same resources. Data corruption can occur if two or more threads try to <b>write</b> <b>into</b> the same memory location, or if one thread reads a memory location before another has finished <b>writing</b> <b>into</b> it. Lamport's bakery algorithm is one of many mutual exclusion algorithms designed to prevent concurrent threads entering critical sections of code concurrently to eliminate the risk of data corruption.|$|R
5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|Like Wollstonecraft's first novel, , The Wrongs of Woman {{is heavily}} autobiographical; the two novels even repeat {{many of the}} same biographical details. After being {{abandoned}} by her lover and the father of her child, Gilbert Imlay (the model for Darnford), Wollstonecraft attempted to commit suicide. Her despair over these events is <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the book as well as many other experiences from the mid-1790s. Moreover, Maria Venables's family history shows clear similarities to Wollstonecraft's own. Like Maria, Wollstonecraft had a mother who favored an elder brother and she also devotedly cared for that mother during her dying days, only to be pushed away during the final moments of her life. Wollstonecraft also looked after her sisters like Maria does, albeit without the help of a wealthy uncle. Perhaps most strikingly, Wollstonecraft's sister Eliza left her husband, at Wollstonecraft's prodding, much as Maria leaves hers. As Kelly explains, autobiography is common in Jacobin novels. Philosophical novels were expected to be autobiographical; audiences believed that the philosophizing novelists would draw on their own experiences in order to illustrate their abstract principles.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E

5|$|The CL had {{situational}} playoff scenarios <b>written</b> <b>into</b> its bylaws {{that required}} either a tie {{in the standings}} or a team with more wins finishing with a worse winning percentage than the top team, but a permanent playoff plan had never been created. In March 2006, encouraged {{by the success of}} the PL's playoff series, CL officials announced their intention to introduce postseason playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. During meetings held later that year, PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system. Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004, the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record. The PL disapproved of the CL's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first-place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete against in the Japan Series, as the PL had been awarding its pennant to its playoff champion.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker and Edge {{continued}} their feud {{over the next}} several weeks. Though, a predicament insured on the May 23 episode of SmackDown, when Vickie Guerrero announced that The Undertaker would face Edge once more for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC) at One Night Stand with the stipulation that if The Undertaker were to lose, he would be forced to leave the WWE. At the June event, Edge defeated The Undertaker {{with the help of his}} accomplices, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, in the TLC match to win the vacant World title and The Undertaker was forced to leave the company, <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the storyline. On the July 25 episode of SmackDown, Guerrero reinstated The Undertaker, after learning of Edge's infidelity with their wedding planner, Guerrero and Edge were in a scripted relationship, and in retaliation she scheduled The Undertaker and Edge in a Hell in a Cell match, a ring surrounded by a steel structure of metal, at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the route predates the {{invention}} of the automobile; the Donner Party, California Trail and Pony Express all followed the present-day path of the highway. During the 1910s, the route was designated a state highway and, in 1939, State Route 201 was officially <b>written</b> <b>into</b> law, running from Magna east to the mouth of Parley's Canyon. At one point, the highway carried US-50 Alternate west of State Street and both US-40 and US-40 Alternate east of that road, though all were truncated from Salt Lake City by the late 1970s. Construction of the freeway portion of SR-201 west of I-15 commenced in the mid-1960s and was fully completed by 1986.|$|E
5|$|The leading staged rivalry <b>written</b> <b>into</b> {{the event}} was between Batista and King Booker. At Survivor Series, WWE's November {{pay-per-view}} event, Batista defeated Booker to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 1, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, one of WWE's primary television programs, King Booker and Finlay both demanded a match against Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. General Manager Theodore Long, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that Booker and Finlay would instead form a tag team to compete against Batista and a partner of his choice at Armageddon. Later that night, Batista announced that his partner would be WWE Champion John Cena, {{a member of the}} Raw brand. The following week on an episode of SmackDown!, Batista defeated Finlay by disqualification after Booker interfered on Finlay's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, Cena defeated Finlay after lifting Finlay up on his shoulders and slamming him to the mat, a move that Cena dubbed the FU.|$|E
5|$|To {{appeal to}} Degrassi's {{established}} audience, {{a number of}} references to events which occurred in Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High and School's Out were <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the episode.

The fedora made a reappearance in this episode, and was worn by Manny, Spike, Snake, Caitlin and Lucy, but not Joey, and it appeared in every scene which featured a character from the old series. The accident in School's Out when Wheels hit Lucy while drink-driving was discussed twice, first at the bar when the characters were discussing their lives, and a second time when Wheels came to the reunion to apologize to Lucy. Finally, Joey and Caitlin made amends; their relationship had ended when he cheated on her with Tessa in School's Out.|$|E

A minimum service requirement was <b>written</b> <b>into</b> the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line, and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours (24 trains per day).
