25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a <b>weather-proof</b> box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the research question: ‘What are the diffusion determinants for extreme <b>weather-proofing</b> {{technology in the}} Australian built environment?’ In order to effectively identify diffusion determinants, a synthesis of literature in both technical and management fields was conducted from a system-wide perspective. Review results where then interpreted through an innovation system framework, drawn from innovation systems literature, in order to map {{the current state of}} extreme <b>weather-proofing</b> technology diffusion in the Australian built environment industry. Drivers and obstacles to optimal diffusion are presented. Results show the important role to be played by Australian governments in facilitating improved weather proofing technology diffusion. This applies to governments in their various roles, but particularly as regulators, clients/owners and investors in research & development and education. In the role as regulators, findings suggest Australian governments should be encouraging the application of innovative finance options and positive end-user incentives to promote the uptake of weather proofing technology. Additionally, in their role as clients/owners, diffusion can be improved by adjusting building and infrastructure specifications to encourage designers and constructors to incorporate extreme weather proofing technology in new and redeveloped built assets. Finally, results suggest greater investment is required in research and development and improved knowledge sharing across the construction supply chain to further mitigate risks associated with greater incidences of extreme weather events. ...|$|R

40|$|The title paper {{architecture}} is often reserved for designs that {{are intended to}} remain solely in some representational form (drawings or models) and have been produced in academia. These works are typically completed either as personal research {{into the nature of}} design or as an architectural response to an issue. Much paper {{architecture is}} also unbuildable and, because of this, it is freed of the traditional burdens of architecture (gravity, <b>weather-proofing</b> and functionality). Yet, by being free of these constraints paper architecture is obliged to bear additional burdens. In particular, it is argued that a responsible paper architecture should function as a bearer of meaning; it is encumbered with the weight of ethics, aesthetics, politics and philosophy. These are also some of the loads borne in academic research and design. The present text is concerned with designs that have been produced from within academic practice, not for the purpose of being constructed nor earning commissions, but primarily as an extension of personal and scholarly research. The paper presents a brief overview of the environments which promote unbuilt architecture before considering possible reasons and motives for producing it.

60|$|With {{the help}} of men from the {{railroad}} settlement Harding finished his house and made it <b>weather-proof</b> before the frost struck deep into the soil. Plowing was now impossible, but there was much to be done. The inside of the dwelling had to be fitted up, and logs were needed for the stables he must build in the spring. Trees large enough for the purpose were scarce; and where coal is unobtainable, cutting wood for fuel keeps the settler busy during the rigorous winter. Harding might have simplified his task by buying sawed lumber, but the long railroad haulage made it expensive, and he never shrank from labor which led to economy.

40|$|The multidimensional {{problems}} facing buildings in Nigeria have reached an endemic proportion. They manifest in quantitative, qualitative {{and also in}} maintenance terms. The climate across the country aids the deterioration of building materials particularly those used in the facades as there is need to extend the lifespan of these external building finishes because of the economic, health, aesthetic and structural problems being experienced by the occupants of the buildings. An increasing {{number of cases of}} poor maintenance of plastered and painted facades characterized by early and unexpected onset of defects and damage to the surface have been noticed in the study areas which has culminated into spending huge amounts of money for such maintenance activities; This paper identifies the different nature and influence of these factors in order to arrive at cost effective ways of preventing and dealing with such defects. Also it establishes the planning horizon over which the various costs that arise during the intended lifetime of the finishes are incurred. Buildings raging from residential (bungalows and multi-storey apartment) to institutional and commercial including those with mixed used that exhibited the external finishes under the changing climatic challenges were carefully observed and analysed through the use of structured questionnaires. The paper concludes by recommending continuous and regular inspection of external surfaces every ten years, provision of a thick porous coating which will give the best <b>weather-proofing</b> and durability results on solid walls and achievement of good and physical adhesion of rendering to the rigid substrate free from dirt, oil, grease and loose particles...|$|R
6000|$|... [26] I find it {{incredible}} {{that there}} will not be a sweeping revolution in the methods of building during the next century. The erection of a house-wall, come to think of it, is an astonishingly tedious and complex business; the final result exceedingly unsatisfactory. It has been my lot recently to follow in detail the process of building a private dwelling-house, and the solemn succession of deliberate, respectable, perfectly satisfied men, who have contributed each so many days of his life to this accumulation of weak compromises, has enormously intensified my constitutional amazement at my fellow-creatures. The chief ingredient in this particular house-wall is the common brick, burnt earth, and but one step from the handfuls of clay of the ancestral mud hut, small in size and permeable to damp. Slowly, day by day, the walls grew tediously up, to a melody of tinkling trowels. These bricks are joined by mortar, which is mixed in small quantities, and must vary very greatly in its quality and properties throughout the house. In order to prevent the obvious evils of a wall of porous and irregular baked clay and lime mud, a damp course of tarred felt, which cannot possibly last more than a few years, was inserted about a foot from the ground. Then the wall, being quite insufficient to stand the heavy drift of weather to which it is exposed, was dabbled over with two coatings of plaster on the outside, the outermost being given a primitive picturesqueness by means of a sham surface of rough-cast pebbles and white-wash, while within, to conceal the rough discomfort of the surface, successive coatings of plaster, and finally, paper, were added, with a wood-skirting at the foot thrice painted. Everything in this was hand work, the laying of the bricks, the dabbing of the plaster, the smoothing of the paper; it is a house built of hands--and some I saw were bleeding hands--just as in the days of the pyramids, when the only engines were living men. The whole confection is now undergoing incalculable chemical reactions between its several parts. Lime, mortar, and microscopical organisms are producing undesigned chromatic effects in the paper and plaster; the plaster, having methods of expansion and contraction of its own, crinkles and cracks; the skirting, having absorbed moisture and now drying again, opens its joints; the rough-cast coquettes with the frost and opens chinks and crannies for the humbler creation. I fail to see the necessity of (and, accordingly, I resent bitterly) all these coral-reef methods. Better walls than this, and better and less life-wasting ways of making them, are surely possible. In the wall in question, concrete would have been cheaper and better than bricks if only [...] "the men" [...] had understood it. But I can dream at last of much more revolutionary affairs, of a thing running to and fro along a temporary rail, that will squeeze out wall as one squeezes paint from a tube, and form its surface with a pat or two as it sets. Moreover, I do not see at all why the walls of small dwelling-houses should be so solid as they are. There still hangs about us the monumental traditions of the pyramids. It ought to be possible to build sound, portable, and habitable houses of felted wire-netting and <b>weather-proofed</b> paper upon a light framework. This sort of thing is, no doubt, abominably ugly at present, but that is because architects and designers, being for the most part inordinately cultured and quite uneducated, are unable to cope with its fundamentally novel problems. A few energetic men might at any time set out to alter all this. And with the inevitable revolutions that must come about in domestic fittings, and which I hope to discuss more fully in the next paper, it is open to question whether many ground landlords may not find they have work for the house-breakers rather than wealth unlimited falling into their hands when the building leases their solicitors so ingeniously draw up do at last expire.|$|R
