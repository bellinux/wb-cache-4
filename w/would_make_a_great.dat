5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E

He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel Oil!, which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He then thought that he would try to find a director that was as passionate about the book as he was, but Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.|$|E

However, it was moved up to the third after Amanda Tapping felt strongly that it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> start-stand alone episode after [...] "Sanctuary for All". She also cited continuity reasons, as the characters appeared more comfortable {{with each other in}} the following episode, [...] "Folding Man". Filming started in January 2007 when they were filming the webisodes. The new scenes were filmed in June 2008. The actors consciously played the characters more open to each other.|$|E

Paul's potential candidacy was discussed in the Los Angeles Times and locally in the Kentucky press. Paul's father said, [...] "Should Senator Bunning decide not to run, I think Rand <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> U.S. Senator."

50|$|While {{working for}} the New Zealand Forest Service, Graeme used his {{research}} on the Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) towards his doctoral work. He decided to work on tahr because at that time everyone claimed {{to be an expert}} on red deer and he thought that he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> contribution working on the lesser known tahr. Caughley wanted to see if Thane Riney's eruption and stabilisation patterns in deer also applied to tahr. He used his studies at the Forest Service for his PhD thesis at the University of Canterbury (1962-1967) advised primarily by Bernard Stonehouse (Antarctic and penguin ecologist). Using three study populations of Himalayan tahr (judged to be in the initial increase, initial stabilisation, and decline stage) Caughley found that tahr follow the pattern that Riney had found in deer.|$|R
500|$|Satyajit Ray, {{working as}} a graphic {{designer}} for Signet Press, created the illustrations for a new abridged edition of the book in 1944. At that time, Ray read the unabridged novel; Signet's owner D. K. Gupta told Ray that the abridged version <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film. The idea appealed to Ray, and around 1946–47, when he considered making a film, he turned to Pather Panchali because of certain qualities that [...] "made it a great book: its humanism, its lyricism, and its ring of truth". The author's widow permitted Ray {{to make a film}} based on the novel; the agreement was in principle only, and no financial arrangement was made.|$|E

Ament said, [...] "We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had {{to put it in}} sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E
500|$|The fifth episode, [...] "Kush", {{was filmed}} on a damaged {{fuselage}} set, {{which was built}} by production designer Bridget McGuire. The episode's cast disliked the episode the most {{because they had to}} act as if they were in freezing temperatures, where in fact it was around 40degrees Celsius. Because it was an expensive set, the producers wanted to reuse it. It was later redesigned to look like the inside of a submarine for [...] "Requiem". It was redressed again for [...] "Revelations". Although released third, [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] was filmed as the fourth episode, and was considered to be aired after [...] "Folding Man". However, Tapping felt strongly that it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> stand alone episode after [...] "Sanctuary for All", and the characters appeared more comfortable with each other in [...] "Folding Man". Swapping the episodes caused a major continuity issue, in which Ashley appears to show scratches on her neck from [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] in [...] "Folding Man", but not in between.|$|E

2500|$|The {{utility of}} the TMAS {{is that it is}} a way to relate anxiety {{directly}} to performance in a certain area. The scale is able to measure anxiety levels and use the scores to determine performance on certain tasks. [...] In some studies, researchers found that high anxiety (high drive) participants <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of mistakes, therefore taking longer for the participants to reach the learned criterion, where as participants with low anxiety (low drive) would reach the learned criterion quicker. The TMAS was able to measure that anxiety, so the researchers could make inclusions or exclusions of the participants for their specific studies. This would allow them to achieve the results they want. The TMAS was also a way to relate intelligence to anxiety. Studies have shown there is a possible correlation between anxiety and academic achievement, but they do not recommend it be the sole predictor of achievement. It should be paired with other tests in order to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> accurate prediction.|$|R
500|$|Jardine, {{who retired}} from regular {{first-class}} cricket after the tour, had little patience with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, {{when they were}} having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: [...] "Thank God we have one bowler in the side"—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity {{was impressed with the}} depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: [...] "I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> captain himself." [...] Historian David Frith writes that Verity was [...] "probably the cricketer [...] admired above all others", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> movie or book, but not a game." ...|$|E
50|$|Syracuse University {{maintains}} {{an agreement with}} Charter Spectrum who purchased Time Warner Cable in 2016 for extensive local coverage of its teams, the result {{of which was the}} creation of what is now Spectrum Sports (formerly Time Warner Cable SportsChannel), a sports network that covers most of Empire's old territory and operates out of Empire's old studios in West Seneca. Some of Empire's sports rights, such as the handful of Bisons games that aired on the network, ended up being acquired by WNGS (channel 67), before ending up back in Time Warner's hands after WNGS briefly came under the operation of a religious organization; WNGS, now rechristened as WBBZ-TV, originally indicated it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> push for sports rights after being revived as a commercial, locally owned station (indeed, WBBZ hired Koshinski as an executive producer in 2012). Ultimately, WBBZ abandoned most of its sports broadcasts in 2015 when Koshinski left the station.|$|R

40|$|Both {{within the}} UK {{and in a}} wider {{international}} context, there is an increasing concern with {{young people who are}} not in education, employment, or training (NEET). The author details research undertaken within Greater Merseyside (UK), which has relatively high levels of young NEET and where a ‘culture of worklessness’ has developed within the poorest areas. A focus is placed on the degree to which intergenerational factors influence NEET status, as opposed to peer influence, (low) educational attainment/disaffection, poor labour-market experience, or a lack of (place-specific) employment/education or training opportunities. Through reference to Hodkinson’s pragmatic rational decision-making model, it is suggested that the success of policy interventions has been limited because of the diversity of influences on an individual’s NEET status. However, <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on addressing intergenerational issues through a focus on activities such as positive parenting, raising aspirations, and addressing family breakdown <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> impact, in conjunction with addressing disaffection through the provision of alternative forms of education, removing barriers to employment, and subsidising involvement in further/higher education. ...|$|R

40|$|South Africa’s hosting of the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ {{came at a}} {{time when}} {{countries}} and cities worldwide were increasingly competing for this sought-after status. The benefits and challenges of such an event have received significant attention from researchers and practitioners alike. No tourism destination is guaranteed long-term competitiveness by being offered the once-off opportunity to host a major international event. This study aimed to determine whether <b>a</b> mega-event <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> or lesser contribution to the long-term competitiveness of the host destination given {{the extent to which it}} was being addressed at a strategic level. Existing literature on destination competitiveness and mega-events was studied to identify relevant issues that would have to be addressed at this level. Primary and secondary qualitative data were collected from a host city on the eve of the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ to place these issues into perspective. The empirical findings indicate how a mega-event can contribute to the competitiveness of a destination if it forms part of a broader event strategy; if the necessary leadership is in place; and stakeholder roles have been clarified.
