30|$|Suppose that A <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> {{definite}} (semidefinite), {{then all}} H-eigenvalues of A <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> (nonnegative).

From the results above, {{we know that}} all H-eigenvalues of P_π (A) <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> (nonnegative).

Reception of the video by critics <b>were</b> <b>positive,</b> with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
5|$|Chenevix-Trench {{was known}} for his {{substantial}} tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School. He died in 1979. In 1994, a book by Tim Card, a former Vice-Provost of Eton, revealed {{for the first time that}} Chenevix-Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord. There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix-Trench's use of corporal punishment, and numerous letters to the editor in response, most of which <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> about Chenevix-Trench's legacy. Peel, a teacher at Fettes College at the time, published The Land of Lost Content two years later.|$|E

40|$|Skin {{tumors are}} tumors arising from {{keratinocyte}} and from adnexal structures. Immunohistochemistry is {{very helpful in}} diagnosis of difficult cases in epithelial skin neoplasms, especially basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> for BerEP 4, a keratin marker, and mostly negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Squamous cell carcinoma cells <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> for EMA and cytokeratin, which are of higher molecular weight than those found in BCC. In contrast to BCC, trichoblastoma and trichoepithelioma are negative for androgen receptors. Of the malignant dermal spindle cell lesions, spindle cell squamous carcinoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to 34 betaE 12, desmoplasmic melanoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to S 100, and leiomyosarcoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to desmin. Of the malignant pagetoid cells, Paget′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 7 and cam 5. 2, whereas the pagetoid variant of Bowen′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 5 / 6. Melanoma in-situ <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to both S 100 and melan-A. Immunohistochemistry is an extremely valuable adjunct to standard morphologic diagnosis in diagnostic pathology. Diagnosis of epithelial tumor depends largely on morphological features but, in rare cases, immunohistochemical stains are needed for definitive diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, partly as a {{response}} to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students. Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program. In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.|$|E

The game was praised for its large and diverse {{character}} roster, its improvements to game mechanics, and its variety of multiplayer options. Some criticisms include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. The 3DS version sold over a million copies in its first weekend on sale in Japan, and had sold more than 3.22 million copies worldwide {{by the end of}} October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album <b>were</b> <b>positive,</b> with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles {{and quality of the}} pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as {{possibly}} his finest to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling that some of the styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E
