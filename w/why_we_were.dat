500|$|After a {{performance}} opening for evangelist Billy Wayne Arrington in Dublin, Virginia, Arrington invited Bunn and Reedy {{to join his}} touring band. [...] Bunn credits Arrington with helping to alter the band's focus: [...] "We were playing music for God, but we didn't really know <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing it. [...] It was more so to be 'rock stars', per se, and just use God {{as a way to}} get there. [...] And so he really helped us flip-flop that and get it the way it should be." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 28, the FBI New York {{field office}} {{requested}} that {{a criminal case}} be opened to determine whether Mihdhar {{was still in the}} United States, but the request was refused. The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not understand <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'" [...] The reply from headquarters was, [...] "we [...] are all frustrated with this issue ... hese are the rules. NSLU does not make them up." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all {{so we had to}} do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Several {{films have}} focused on the raid, while also {{including}} archival footage of the POWs. Edward Dmytryk's 1945 film Back to Bataan, starring John Wayne, opens by retelling the story of the raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp-with real life film of the POW survivors. Based on the books The Great Raid on Cabanatuan and Ghost Soldiers, the 2005 John Dahl film The Great Raid focused on the raid intertwined with a love story. [...] Prince served as a consultant on the film, and believed it depicted the raid accurately. Marty Katz conveyed his interest in producing the film: [...] "This [...] was a massive operation that had very little chance of success. It's like a Hollywood movie—it couldn't really happen, but it did. That was <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> attracted to the material." [...] Another cover of the raid aired in December 2006 as an episode of the documentary series Shootout!.|$|E
500|$|Schamus {{was still}} {{rewriting}} the script in October 2001. In early 2002, as filming was underway, Michael France {{read all the}} scripts for the Writers Guild of America, to determine who would get final credit. France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, [...] "James Schamus did {{a significant amount of}} work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> credited." [...] France, Turman and Schamus received final credit. A theatrical release date for June 20, 2003 was announced in December 2001, with the film's title as The Hulk.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know <b>why.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E
500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I {{want to give them}} even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E

So they were not useful and that is <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> unhappy with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final was contested by England and Australia. Just before half time, England led 21–0 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all {{converted}} by Nick Beal.

In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain [...] "Prince" [...] Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal. [...] Adedayo Adebayo, {{a member of that}} victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said [...] "We were basically a scratch side. We got {{together for the first time}} as a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to wing it slightly – the talent came through.

2500|$|Upon arrival, George Mikhailovich and {{the other}} Grand Dukes were {{questioned}} at length by Moisei Uritsky, the Chairman of the Petrograd Cheka. Grand Duke George wrote [...] "Dmitry asked Uritsky <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> imprisoned, and his answer {{was that it was}} to save us as the people intended shooting us at Vologda, an explanation hard to believe." [...] The prisoners were photographed, and then moved to the Kresty prison. Shortly thereafter, they were transferred to Shpalernaya prison, where they would remain for most of their incarceration. Here each had his own private cell, if only seven feet long and three feet wide. Their only furniture was a hard iron bed. The Grand Dukes were permitted to exercise a half-hour to 45 minutes twice a day, although the personal contact allowed in Vologda was denied them here at first. Their wardens, all of whom were soldiers, treated them well; they even helped George Mikhailovich to smuggle out letters. After several days, they were all allowed to gather in the courtyard and were permitted some provisions from the outside such as fresh linens and cigarettes. Their day began at 7am when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. Lunch was served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones on it and black bread. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7pm, although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. The meetings of the Grand Dukes during exercise gave them opportunity to exchange a few words.|$|E
