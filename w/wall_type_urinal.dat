30|$|This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} from 2005 to 2008 regarding the thermal environment of three types of experimental houses—a wood and mud composite <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> (Type WM), a mud <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> (Type M), and an insulated <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> (Type I). To reveal {{the influence of the}} wall composition of wooden houses on the indoor thermal environment, each experimental house was constructed on the same site. As a result, under natural indoor air temperatures, the monthly average indoor air temperature level and the time ratio of indoor air temperature surpassing the outdoor air temperature were in the following order: Type I > Type WM > Type M. Type WM exhibited the highest phase shift of air temperature, indicating that the insulation performance and heat capacity affect the phase shift of air temperature. The equalization of indoor air temperature through the suppression of the increase in the indoor air temperature of Type M is likely caused by low insulation performance and large thermal capacity. The time fluctuations in electric consumption by air conditioning and indoor–outdoor air temperature differences of each experimental house over 1  day indicated that a building’s thermal load and the thermal capacity are related.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Presentation date: 2007 - 02 - 23 The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to gain an insight into the load sharing aspect between {{oriented}} strand board (OSB) and gypsum wall board (GWB) in shear wall assembly during racking load. More specifically the objectives of the study were to: (1) evaluate qualitatively the load sharing between OSB and GWB in a wood frame shear wall assembly, (2) analyze the failure progression of GWB and OSB, (3) study the strain profile around fastener on GWB and OSB sides of shear wall, and (4) study the effect of GWB on shear wall behavior. Monotonic tests were conducted on 2440 x 2440 mm walls with 38 x 89 mm Douglas-fir studs 610 mm on center. Two 1220 x 2440 x 11. 1 mm OSB panels were installed and fastened vertically to the frame with Stanley Sheather plus ring shank nails 102 mm and 305 mm on center along panel edges and intermediate studs, respectively. Two 12. 7 mm GWB panels were installed oriented vertically on the face opposite the OSB using standard dry wall screws on some walls. Anchorage to the walls was provided by two 12. 7 mm A 307 anchor bolts installed 305 mm inward on the sill plate from each end of the wall. In addition to these anchor bolts, walls included hold-downs installed at the end studs of the wall and were attached to the foundation with 15. 9 mm Grade 5 anchor bolts making the walls fully anchored. The loading was monotonic and based on ASTM E 564 - 00. Sixteen walls were tested in total, out of which 11 (Type A) were sheathed on both sides with OSB and GWB, while 5 walls were tested without GWB (Type B). Optical measurement equipment based on the principle of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used for data acquisition and analysis. DIC is a full-field, non-contact technique for measurement of displacements and strains. The set up consist of a pair of cameras arranged at an angle to take stereoscopic images of the specimen. The system returns full field 3 D displacement and strain data measured over the visible specimen surfaces. The tests revealed that load is shared by both OSB and GWB initially in a shear wall assembly. GWB fails locally prior to OSB and load shifts to OSB as GWB starts to fail. Beyond this point, load continues to increase and walls finally fail in OSB. The tests also revealed that load path in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A and B is different. Failure in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A starts at the uplift corner in GWB and then moves to the uplift corner in OSB. Finally the walls fail at middle of top plate for GWB and OSB both. In <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> B the failure is initiated at the uplift corner in OSB followed by middle region at sill level and ends up at middle section of wall where two panels meet. The uplift corner fasteners are of prime importance in both <b>types</b> of <b>wall</b> and panels. Comparing the strain profiles created using DIC, strains only near fasteners are observed and no detectable strain is observed in the field of the panel. There is a steady built up of strain in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> B from start to failure and there is no abrupt change in strain during entire loading indicating a ductile failure. <b>Wall</b> <b>type</b> B shows more ductile behavior than <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A because of the lack of ability of GWB to deform at higher load in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A where as OSB in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> B continues to deform at higher load. Also OSB panel in <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> B experiences higher strains than the OSB panel for <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A for a given load. In <b>wall</b> <b>type</b> A, there is higher strain around the fasteners in GWB than in OSB in the initial part of loading. GWB is stiffer than OSB, it attracts load and in turn deformation is higher than OSB. But being brittle, GWB fails at around 60...|$|R

40|$|Collapsed or {{deformed}} {{walls in}} ancient structures constitute important evidence in archaeoseismology, where damage is interpreted {{in terms of}} earthquake ground motion. A large variety of <b>wall</b> <b>types</b> have been developed during the millennia in different cultural backgrounds. Often walls with polygonal-shaped building blocks are regarded as more earthquake-resistant than a wall consisting of rectangular elements and, as is sometimes speculated, that the irregular <b>wall</b> <b>types</b> were intentionally developed for that purpose. We use simply structured discrete element models of four walls with different block geometries, perfect rectangular, an Inka-type structure and two polygonal designs, to test their dynamic behavior. In addition to an analytic calculation of ground motion, we use measured strong motion signals as boundary conditions for the 3 D wall models with varying height to width ratios. At peak ground accelerations between 1. 0 and 9. 0  m/s 2 and major frequencies of 0. 5 to 3 Hz, numeric experiments with the horizontally applied analytic ground motions result in clear differences in {{the resistance of the}} four <b>wall</b> <b>types</b> with the rectangular block wall being most vulnerable. For more complex measured 3 D motions the Inka-type wall proves more stable than the rectangular block wall; however, height to width ratio still has equally strong influence on the stability.
