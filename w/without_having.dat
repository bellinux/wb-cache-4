5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the area of Bridge <b>Without</b> <b>had</b> been removed {{completely}} from the City's boundaries in 1899, the ward continued to de jure exist and the Court of Aldermen continued to appoint an alderman for the ward by co-option, usually the senior late Lord Mayor (or father of the City) until as late as 1978 — Bridge Without was then merged with Bridge Within, to become the present day Bridge ward. This is, in a sense, a return to the situation prior to 1550. However the ward is still officially referred to as [...] "Bridge and Bridge Without" [...] {{as a result of the}} 1978 amalgamation. This had no practical effect in terms of representation on the Court of Common Council because <b>Without</b> <b>had</b> never had Councilmen.|$|R

5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates <b>without</b> <b>having</b> a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
