After taking selfies, Amuro and two female bake-up dancers dance to the remaining part of the chorus. Amuro runs to a dressing room and picks out a pink mini-dress. Four back-up dancers than look at several other outfits on clothes rackings, and dance to the song. Amuro {{walks out of the}} dressing room in the pink mini-dress, and receives an invitation to her birthday. Two small children (one boy and one girl) walk Amuro into a small room, whilst two back-up dancers hold curtains. The curtains are pulled, and Amuro is seen behind them with balloons. The dancers and extra actors celebrate Amuro's birthday with balloons and confetti as she sings the song. Amuro and the back-up dancers perform during the last chorus, with the camera zooming out; the final scene has everyone putting their hands up, as the locations Amuro visited are circulated around a circle stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pink</b> bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E

25|$|In a very {{different}} vein, much later, in the 1980s, a talented generation of players revived the club's spirit. They carried {{it back to the}} top of French rugby thanks to their performances on the pitch, but they also wanted to bring the fun back into the game, to take rugby out of its Parisian anonymity. They did so through a combination of serious football, humour and self-mockery. Their famous antics were invented by the club's backs (including France flyhalf Franck Mesnel and France wing Jean-Baptiste Lafond) who once played a game in Bayonne with berets on their heads as a tribute to the tradition of attacking play of the Basque club Aviron Bayonnais (11 Jan 1987). As members of a gang which they called le show bizz, they played other matches with black make-up on (10 April 1988 at Stade Toulousain), hair dyed yellow, bald caps (26 Feb 1989 against Béziers), wigs and even dressed up as pelote players (white shirts, black jackets and berets, again) in March 1990 at Biarritz Olympique. In April 1989, they wore long red and white striped shorts to celebrate the sans-culotte who took the Bastille on 14 July 1789. They wore long white trousers to look like players of old in the French championship semi-final on 26 April 1987—and won. Their best prank was in the next game though: they played the 1987 final against Toulon <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pink</b> bow tie (2 May). Just before kick-off, Lafond presented French president François Mitterrand, who always attended the national final, with one of those bow ties. They lost that match but went on to play the 1990 final with the same bow ties. At half-time, they had a drink of champagne on the pitch to recover from the efforts of the first half—and won what proved to be the club's last top-flight title for a quarter-century.|$|E
