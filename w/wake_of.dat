40|$|The use of {{a package}} of {{computer}} programs developed to calculate the in duct acoustic mods excited by a fan/stator stage operating at subsonic tip speed is described. The following three noise source mechanisms are included: (1) sound generated by the rotor blades interacting with turbulence ingested into, or generated within, the inlet duct; (2) sound generated by the stator vanes interacting with the turbulent <b>wakes</b> <b>of</b> the rotor blades; and (3) sound generated by the stator vanes interacting with the velocity deficits in the mean <b>wakes</b> <b>of</b> the rotor blades. The computations for three different noise mechanisms are coded as three separate computer program packages. The computer codes are described by means of block diagrams, tables of data and variables, and example program executions; FORTRAN listings are included...|$|R
40|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{are considered to}} be a standard technology in wireless communications and they are widely used in military, surveillance, medicine, industry and houses as well. In sensor networks batteries with limited amount of energy provide energy for the whole system. They are not rechargeable {{and as soon as the}} batteries die the network life time will expire too. Using computational intelligence to schedule sleep and <b>waking</b> <b>of</b> the sensor nodes is one of the suitable methods which helps the network to have a longer life. In this paper the focus is on a fuzzy method to schedule sleeping and <b>waking</b> <b>of</b> sensor nodes. In this method the Environmental conditions of each sensor (the number of neighbors, the remaining energy, and the distance to the next cluster node) are considered as inputs by the application of a fuzzy system based on which the system creates an output and the sleeping and <b>waking</b> time <b>of</b> each sensor is dynamically determined. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other basic methods and consume less energy as well...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the generic problem <b>of</b> <b>wake</b> instabilities past fixed axisymmetric bodies, {{and focus on}} the extreme cases of a sphere and a flat disk. Numerical results reveal that the <b>wakes</b> <b>of</b> these two bodies evolve differently as the Reynolds number is increased. Especially, two new vortex shedding modes are identified behind a disk. To interpret these results, we introduce a model based on the theory of mode interactions in presence of O(2) symmetry. This model, which was initially developed for the Taylor–Couette system, allows us to explain the structural differences observed {{in the evolution of the}} two types <b>of</b> <b>wakes</b> and to accurately predict the evolution of the lift force...|$|R
