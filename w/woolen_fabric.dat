25|$|Another {{alternative}} to the traditional habit was a coat-dress called a joseph or riding coat (borrowed in French as redingote), usually of unadorned or simply trimmed <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric,</b> with full-length, tight sleeves and a broad collar with lapels or revers. The redingote was later worn as an overcoat with the light-weight chemise dress.|$|E
25|$|The fotă is a richly-ornamented {{wrap-around}} skirt {{made out}} of a rectangular piece of <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> worn at the waist. Alternately, {{it can be made}} of two pieces of woven material that cover the front of the body (like an apron) and the back. The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in Muntenia), opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia).|$|E
50|$|The name {{is taken}} due to {{handmade}} costumes (<b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> handmade costumes), which {{were made in}} the region that made the cloaks and the sails for sailing ships of the era.|$|R
50|$|Tuu'luq used {{embroidery}} thread, felt, {{and dense}} <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics.</b> She {{was a part}} of a circle of Northern fabric artists (including Jessie Oonark and Irene Avaalaaqiaq) who helped establish the contemporary art form of large-scale, two-dimensional, embroidered textile works.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of surviving mantuas, which are made of the rich brocaded silks popular {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, the Kimberley mantua is a practical winter costume, made of striped <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> embroidered with silver-gilt yarns. The fabric, sometimes described as broadcloth, is actually a [...] "soft, fine, tabby-woven (over one, under one) <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> that has been given a napped surface though not the dense, felted finish characteristic of broadcloth." [...] The background color is something between [...] "brownish" [...] and [...] "warm grey".

2500|$|Herbert Giles {{created the}} first Chinese-English encyclopedic {{dictionary}} in two ways, with comprehensive explanations under head entries and with informative tables. His example was followed by many later Chinese-English dictionaries {{up to the present}} time (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). First, some dictionary entries include in-depth information. Take pǔlu 氆氇 [...] "a <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> made in Tibet" [...] as an example. Giles gives P'u3 氆3 (9514) [...] "An open-woven, thick woolen cloth, either plain or flowered, with a nap on one side, known as 氆氇. It comes from Tibet, and is used for making the winter caps of Lamas. Known to the Mongols as cheng-mé and chalma." [...] Second, Giles's dictionary has six tables, in addition to the requisite table of the 214 Kangxi Radicals (essential for using a radical-and-stroke index) included by Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams. The tables are for Insignia of Official Rank, The Family Names, The Chinese Dynasties, Topographical, The Calendar, and Miscellaneous (Chinese numerals). Another table is found in the dictionary front matter, called the Table of Sounds (1892) or Table of Sounds for Dialects (1912).|$|E

50|$|From the 18th and {{especially}} in the 19th century, besides metal processing the craft of wool and silk processing went through as well. In the Old Bazaar of Gjakova were produced and sold in wholesale: felts, silken and <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> <b>woolen</b> and silken lacing, etc. that were exported continuously to bigger quantities at the markets and fairs of the neighboring provinces of the Balkans, Mediterranean and those of the Central European Countries.|$|R

50|$|Kazakhs {{will often}} use white fleeces, and {{consider}} the wool from the neck of sheep valuable. The hair of the Bactrian camel is also used in more luxurious pieces of clothing. As a pure undercoat collected after the camel has molted, it is considered particularly valuable. In ancient times, imported cotton, silk, and <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics</b> were used by Kazakh nomads. The feudal nobility would use imported fabrics to make their clothing, while less affluent Kazakhs wore more easily accessible materials such as furs, leather, and self-made <b>woolen</b> pieces. <b>Fabrics</b> were home-spun, and produced on a primitive horizontal-type machine.|$|R
50|$|Larvex Corporation was {{a company}} which {{manufactured}} Spraying Larvex, a pest control product used in moth proofing <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The firm {{was acquired by}} Zonite Products Corporation in October 1926.

Most of the Carson colchas {{were made from}} recycled <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics.</b> They were priced reasonably, and sold well. Many are now in museum collections.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, British-made cotton poplin was {{introduced}} to the United States, but the American market thought that the name had connotations of heaviness and arbitrarily renamed it broadcloth, a name that persists for a cotton or polyester-cotton blend fabric used for shirting. In Europe, broadcloth typically describes a densely woven <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> with a smooth finish.|$|E

50|$|<b>Woolen</b> <b>fabrics</b> for {{everyday}} use were produced by weavers in Majdal, Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Jerusalem. The wool could be from sheep, goats or camels. Weaving among the Bedouins {{was and is}} still traditionally carried out by women to create domestic items, such as tents, rugs, and pillow covers. Thread is spun from sheep's wool, colored with natural dyes, and woven into a strong fabric using a ground loom.|$|R
5000|$|A poncho ( [...] ; punchu in Quechua; Mapudungun pontro, blanket, <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric)</b> is {{an outer}} garment {{designed}} to keep the body warm.

50|$|Beryl is a {{given name}} that has {{overwhelmingly}} been borne by females {{with reference to the}} mineral beryl. It is deemed unisex due to occasional American usage as a male name, likely a variant spelling of the surname Burrell whose seeming root is the Old French bovre, a reddish-brown <b>woolen</b> <b>fabric</b> with the resultant name denoting a worker in the wool trade; Beryl may also be a variant spelling of the Yiddish (Judeo-German) male name Berel.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of knitted fabrics embedded with conducting yarns at different temperatures was studied in this paper. Two types of resistance, linear resistance and contact resistance {{have been considered}} and discussed by experimental studies and theoretical modeling. Two silver-coated conductive yarns, yarn A and B, with linear resistance of 68. 6 Ω/cm and 1 Ω/cm respectively, were embedded into normal knitted <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The temperature effect on the resistance of these two conductive knitted fabrics {{as a function of}} applied voltages was extensively explored. The results have shown that the resistance of either conductive knitted fabric decreases significantly (maximum 30 %) when its temperature is rising. It can be explained by two main factors: the {{electrical resistance}} of the silver-coated conductive yarns decreases as temperature rises; the physical contact of the overlapped conductive yarns extends due to heating on <b>woolen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which causes a decrease in contact resistance. This research has shown that the temperature effect on the conductivity of the knitted fabrics embedded with conductive yarns should be carefully considered in future industrial applications.
