40|$|The {{international}} exchange of tax information, and its merits compared to withholding taxes, {{is the central}} topic in current debates in international tax policy. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterize and compare the tax regimes that emerge with and without information exchange, under the assumption that countries are unable to differentiate between the taxes they apply to residents and non-residents. It focuses in particular on the role of asymmetries in country size (capturing a key feature of tax havens) and on the impact and potential desirability of schemes to share the revenue raised by withholding (as under the new EU savings tax arrangements) or (more innovatively) as a consequence of information exchange. It is shown that (irrespective of country size difference) Pareto efficiency requires that all revenue collected from nonresidents be transferred to the residence country which would require taking the EU practice even further from the norm, but is currently the norm in relation to information exchange. A <b>withholding</b> <b>scheme</b> with revenue fully reallocated in this way Pareto dominates information sharing, whatever the allocation under the latter. Comparing schemes in which there is no revenue sharing, however, shows that information exchange Pareto dominates simple withholding. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} exchange of tax information, and its merits compared to withholding taxation, {{has emerged as}} a central topic in international tax policy. We characterize and compare the outcomes that emerge, in a two-country world, with and without information exchange, under the assumption that countries are unable to tax residents and non-residents differentially. The analysis focuses on the role of asymmetries in country size (capturing a key feature of tax havens) and on the impact and potential desirability of schemes to share the revenue raised by withholding (as under the new EU savings tax arrangements) or (more innovatively) as a consequence of information exchange. We show that, irrespective of any difference in country size, it is in the interests of both countries, in terms of tax revenue, that all revenue collected from non-residents be transferred to the residence country-which would entail taking the EU practice even further from the norm, but is currently the standard in relation to information exchange. A <b>withholding</b> <b>scheme</b> with revenue fully reallocated in this way gives both countries more revenue than does information sharing, whatever the allocation under the latter.

40|$|Considering {{the need}} to broaden the tax base and to {{increase}} tax revenue in an efficient, equitable, and cost-effective manner, this paper analyzes presumptive taxation methods and their application in sub-Saharan Africa. Presumptive taxation involves simple techniques to capture income that frequently escapes conventional taxation. Presumptive taxation methods could be used more intensively in sub-Saharan Africa, and presumptive taxes on imports, <b>withholding</b> <b>schemes,</b> and graduated business license fees are most effective in raising additional tax revenue in a way commensurate with efficiency, equity, and administrative expediency. Also, intensified presumptive taxation will need stronger institutional capacity in tax administration. ...|$|R

If he be not necessitous, what a sordid wretch is he to <b>withhold</b> his <b>scheme</b> for lucre? putting it up at public sale; {{so that if you}} do not give him his price you shall not have it.|$|R
40|$|This Article first {{discusses}} the United States tax treatment of foreigners generally and the pre-Foreign Investors Real Property Tax Act <b>withholding</b> and taxation <b>scheme</b> {{with respect to}} foreign investment in United States real estate. Then follows {{a discussion of the}} several ways in which foreign investors were, before the Act, able to avoid tax on the disposition of United States real estate and a critical evaluation of the Act 2 ̆ 7 s response to those avoidance methods. Finally, a discussion of the Act 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement provisions and a general discussion of withholding of tax on nonresidents is provided...|$|R
