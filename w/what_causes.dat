5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) is {{a faculty}} and a {{research}} institution dedicated to discovering <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> {{mental illness and}} diseases of the brain, and to help identify new treatments of the diseases. The institute is the largest centre for research and postgraduate education in psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience in Europe. Originally established in 1924 as the Maudsley Hospital Medical School, the institute {{changed its name to}} the Institute of Psychiatry in 1948, merged with King’s College London in 1997, and was renamed IoPPN in 2014.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> the Great Red Spot's reddish color.

25|$|Cradle cap is {{not caused}} by {{bacterial}} infection, allergy or poor hygiene. Cradle cap is also not contagious.

25|$|The {{combination}} of composite waves with short fundamental frequencies and shared or closely related partials is <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> {{the sensation of}} harmony.

This is called beating, and is considered unpleasant, or dissonant.|$|E

25|$|It {{is through}} the will that mankind finds all their suffering. Desire for more is <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> this suffering.

In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex which seems to be related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. The cause is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Sleep in {{aging is}} another equally {{important}} area of research.

25|$|While {{there is}} no clear {{agreement}} on <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> bubbles, there is evidence to suggest that they are not caused by bounded rationality or assumptions about the irrationality of others, as assumed by greater fool theory.

25|$|If the {{particle}} {{is located at}} the center of the beam, then individual rays of light are refracting through {{the particle}} symmetrically, resulting in no net lateral force. The net force in this case is along the axial direction of the trap, which cancels out the scattering force of the laser light. The cancellation of this axial gradient force with the scattering force is <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> the bead to be stably trapped slightly downstream of the beam waist.|$|E

25|$|Matsuhashi and Hallett's {{study can}} be {{summarized}} thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after {{it has already been}} started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} counselling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), {{and sometimes}} medication, typically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to <b>what</b> <b>causes</b> the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur. While clomipramine appears {{to work as}} well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects. Atypical antipsychotics may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects. Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.|$|E
25|$|When a virus {{transforms}} a cell {{it often}} causes cancer by either altering the cells' existing genome or introducing additional genetic material which causes cells to uncontrollably replicate.

Viruses transform host cells {{in order to survive}} and replicate; however, the immune responses of the host cell are typically compromised during transformation making transformed cells more susceptible to other viruses.|$|E
