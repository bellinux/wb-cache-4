25|$|After Pakistan's dismal {{show in the}} 2003 Cricket World Cup, another cleanup {{operation}} was undertaken by the PCB, naming Rashid Latif as captain and Javed Miandad as team coach in March 2003. During this reign, Miandad won Pakistan the Sharjah Cup (April 2003) bereft of big names like Inzamam and Yousaf. Pakistan won the home test series against South Africaafter losing 3–2 in the ODI series. Pakistan lost the home ODI series to India in 2004 and following {{the loss of the}} test series, Miandad <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in June 2004, being replaced by South African Bob Woolmer.|$|E
50|$|On 22 July 2005 Leonardo {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} with Shakhtar Donetsk, for a $1.8 million fee. Despite being regularly used, mainly in the 2006-07 campaign, he <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> by the club due to the new rules of the league.|$|E
5000|$|... 2003 {{saw another}} line-up change. Drummer Daniel Petrov left both Ostava and Bulgaria.He was {{replaced}} by Vladimir Vasilev, who had {{made a name for}} himself playing for Animacionerite http://www.animacionerite.com/. With him on board, the band continued recording their third studio album. However, with Petrov returning a year and a half later, Vasilev <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

50|$|His {{methods of}} dealing with criminals {{sometimes}} fell outside of the law. In a 2008 interview, Lisacek remarked {{that if he was}} a policeman now, he would <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on his first day on the job.|$|R
50|$|Léo {{was born}} in Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro. Local-based Americano Futebol Clube gave him his {{professional}} debut in 1996, {{and the next year}} he moved to São Paulo with União São João Esporte Clube. Two seasons later he was bought by Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras but, within six months, he <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} the season was at the time, the worst in Town's history. The team lost most of their early games and Steve Smith, a hero during his playing days at Leeds Road, <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on 6 October, after the 2-0 defeat at Birmingham City. Malcolm Macdonald {{replaced}} Smith a week later, but it wasn't {{until the end of the}} month that Town registered their first win, a 2-1 victory at the end-of-season champions Millwall.|$|E
50|$|The {{managerial}} merry-go-round continued {{when local}} man Gary Erwin was appointed in October 1994 in a vain attempt {{to secure a}} place in the Premier League, despite a famous win against Linfield, he failed miserably and <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in March 1995. Alan Fraser was brought in {{at the end of the}} 1994-95 season, in order to prepare for the forthcoming First Division campaign. Despite throwing the money about, United finished the following season well behind runaway leaders, Coleraine.|$|E

50|$|The QWP was {{the first}} among the smaller {{parliamentary}} groups in the provincial assembly that had consented, after being contacted by Khattak, to support his party in forming the coalition government after it emerged as the largest party in the province. By virtue of Khan’s decision, it {{also happens to be}} the first party that has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> by <b>the</b> PTI.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the season was the worst in the entire history of Huddersfield Town. Town won none of their first 14 league games. In fact the only games they won were two Coca-Cola Cup ties against Bradford City and more {{surprisingly}} Premier League side West Ham United (they eventually lost 3-1 on aggregate against the Hammers) Manager Brian Horton dropped popular keeper Steve Francis for the televised game against Nottingham Forest. Town lost the game 2-0 and two days later Horton <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On August 5, 1974, Richard Nixon {{released}} certain documents {{revealing his}} orders to aides to hinder the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigation of the}} Watergate break-in. When Landgrebe was asked on August 7 about the apparently unanimous support for impeachment of Nixon among his Republican colleagues following this disclosure, he said: [...] "I'm {{going to stick with}} my President even if he and I have to be taken out of this building and shot." [...] The next day, Richard Nixon announced his resignation. A few months later, Landgrebe <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> by his constituents. His re-election bid was derailed by Democrat Floyd Fithian.|$|E
50|$|He first {{represented}} Nottinghamshire in the Second XI Championship in 1989, but his Derbyshire debut {{was one of}} {{the most}} important games of his career, as he hit a century against Oxford University in May 1995. It was surprising, therefore, that it was less than three months before he <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> after Derbyshire underperformed in the 1995 County Championship table.|$|R
50|$|Williams {{attracted}} {{controversy in}} 2008 {{when he made}} a choking gesture targeted at then-Port Adelaide coach, Mark Williams. This was {{in reference to the}} then-Port Adelaide coach's famous choking gesture when the Power 2004 Premiership. Williams was warned that he would <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> if such action occurred again. He did apologise to his Port Adelaide namesake after the game, which Hawthorn won convincingly.|$|R
50|$|Doumbé, {{the son of}} a Cameroonian father, {{was offered}} a place at Clairefontaine at the age of 13 {{alongside}} his friend Philippe Christanval, but his parents turned down the offer as they wanted him to focus on his schoolwork. Nevertheless he won a contract at Paris Saint-Germain and was capped by the French under-21 team against Romania, only to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> at <b>the</b> Parc des Princes after picking up a serious ankle injury.|$|R
50|$|The first Milton Keynes Dons {{manager was}} Stuart Murdoch, who had {{previously}} been manager of Wimbledon. Murdoch only lasted three months into the 2004-05 season before being sacked — his assistant, Jimmy Gilligan, managed the club for a month before Murdochs replacement was revealed to be Danny Wilson. Wilson managed to keep the team up during the 2004-05 season, but failed to repeat this feat during 2005-06. Following relegation, Wilson <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and replaced with Martin Allen. After Allens team fell at the play-offs, he left to manage Leicester City. Paul Ince was appointed manager for the 2007-08 season, and {{proved to be a}} shrewd appointment as MK Dons won the League Two championship as well as the Football League Trophy. Ince too left after only a season, to become manager of Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
50|$|On 19 January 2011, he {{replaced}} the Frenchman Sébastien Migné as {{the manager of}} the Oman national under-23 football team. He was given the charge of leading the team in the Men's Asian Qualifiers of the 2012 Summer Olympics. He led the team to a 7-2 aggregate win over Tajikistan national under-23 football team in the Preliminary Round 1. In the Preliminary Round 2, Oman again put up a great performance against China national under-23 football team defeating them on an aggregate score of 4-1. In the Preliminary Round 3, Oman began their campaign with a 2-0 defeat to hosts South Korea. But then Oman bounced back and won back to back matches against Saudi Arabia and Qatar 2-0 and 3-0 (awarded) respectively. On 22 February 2012, Oman faced a 0-3 home loss against South Korea national under-23 football team and hence losing all the chances of finishing {{at the top of the}} group which would have earned them a direct spot at 2012 Summer Olympics for the first time. As a result of this loss, he <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and the country’s London Olympics hopes were now in the hands of the national team coach Paul Le Guen who was appointed as the manager for the Playoff Round and also the AFC-CAF play-off.|$|E
40|$|Inger Mewburn discusses {{the online}} ethics that University staff and {{students}} should adhere to, in The Conversation.. Trying {{to control your}} reputation online {{is a bit like}} trying to clean up wee in a toddler pool. You {{are much more likely to}} get your hands dirty than achieve any kind of meaningful damage control. Many universities in Australia are trying to define what is acceptable – and unacceptable – for their staff members to say online. Academics too, are exploring the boundaries between expression of academic freedom and the obligation to their institutions in an age when anything you say or write can be easily posted online. A number of high-profile cases of academic trouble in cyberspace has prompted universities to try and protect their reputations. But often their reactions and policies are just making matters worse. Damage control The latest example is the case of an adjunct academic, Jim Nicholls, who was apparently sacked from the University of New England for writing a satirical poem. Nicholls wrote the poem to cheer up a fellow staff member, Jan-Piet Knijff, who had just been sacked. It is unclear whether the poem was ever intended by its author to become public, but trouble started when Knijff posted it online. Another staff member took offence at the contents and demanded its removal. Despite Knijff taking the poem down, Mr Nicholls, who had been working as a largely unpaid adjunct for some years, <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on the grounds that the poem bought UNE management into disrepute. But this most recent case is one of many where an academic’s personal opinions or activity online has caused trouble for their institution. Last year, then head of RMIT University’s School of Art, Professor Elizabeth Grierson,brought a cyberstalking case against a former staff member, Steve Cox. The case backfired, with Professor Grierson being ordered to stay away from Cox’s Facebook page for 20 years. A couple of weeks ago Monash University stood down a staff member in a complicated “trolling” incident involving the presenter from Australia’s Next Top Model. The Monash staff member was accused of making some unsavoury comments from an anonymous Twitter account. The staff member was not saved by the fact that the account was anonymous and did not mention any connection with the university. Unintended consequences These days universities need to think about how an incident like Jim Nicholls 2 ̆ 7 might be summarised in 140 characters or less. In this case, the tweet might go something like this: “Dude writes a poem, gets fired”. As, John Gilmore, one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier foundation once famously said, “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it”. The story about UNE management clamping down harshly on an employee is likely to travel much further than the poem could have travelled by itself, even if it stayed on the internet forever. This kind of internet publicity problem has been called “The Streisand effect”. The phrase was coined after legendary singer Babra Steisand tried to stop photographs of her cliff-top residence being published in a public archive of coastal erosion in California. As the case progressed it was revealed that the offending photographs, which had been published in a set of 12, 000 similar shots, had only been downloaded six times before the case began; two of these downloads were by Streisand’s own attorneys. However, the publicity surrounding the case resulted in nearly half a million downloads of photos in the first month the case was in court. Instead of preserving her privacy, Streisand spent a reputed 50 million dollars to create entirely the opposite effect. Turn the other cheek? These cases raise some interesting questions. Should universities just ignore academics trolling, misbehaving or merely being cheeky online? Should academics always be able to freely criticise their institutions, or their colleagues, in public, on the grounds of academic freedom? I’m not sure. I’m against using the academic freedom argument to justify behaviour that is rude, bullying or otherwise socially unacceptable. Likewise not using your real name should be no defence against such behaviour; hiding behind anonymity is the refuge of cowards. That being said, there’s a difference between bullying and satire. While I have sympathy with what the universities are trying to achieve in their policies, I wonder if much of this effort is misplaced. If you want to control your reputation on the internet, it’s far better to concentrate on learning how to react well to public criticism. If universities wish to attract the best minds, they should work on creating the appearance of being tolerant workplaces which encourage vigorous discussion and the exchange of ideas – even if they don’t always agree with them. There’s a lesson here for academics too. Nothing – not even a funny poem between friends – is private when just about everyone carries a publishing platform in their pocket. Expect to be tweeted when you give a lecture; don’t put anything in an email that you wouldn’t be happy to appear on a webpage, or have read aloud to the Vice-Chancellor. And next time you feel like having a whinge about the university, or a colleague, pick up the phone and make acoffee date. It’s safer.

25|$|In April 2008, it was {{reported}} that Koné <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> at Sevilla in the summer of 2008 after a disappointing first season. His lack of playing time, partly due to the form of strikers Luís Fabiano and Kanouté, and an argument on the training ground with a member of the training staff that was caught on Spanish television, made for some intense speculation about the player's future. In the run-up to the 2008–09 campaign, he suffered a serious injury while playing for the Ivory Coast against Guinea on 20 August, and a subsequent scan showed he had suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in his left leg. He underwent surgery to repair the damage the following week, returning to training in February 2009.|$|R

5000|$|After Pooja Misrra's {{unexpected}} exit, Bigg Boss 5 {{started to}} lose its viewership {{in less than a}} week. In India, many fans who were supporters of the newly renowned Pooja M., who <b>was</b> bullied throughout <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> stopped watching since she <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Many others stopped watching because of Sky and Siddharth's indecent display of manners towards the female inhabitants and also due to the continuous favoritism by Bigg Boss who had always showed a lenient attitude towards the male contestants. As a result, Bigg Boss 5 got a marked decline in its TRP ratings which fell drastically after the Aapka Farmaan episode aired on 26 November 2011. According to some TRP sites, BB5 had reached 0.69 at one point. The Undekha Act was not in top 100.|$|R
50|$|The upshot {{was that}} Graham McMillan {{received}} {{an invitation from}} London Club Leyton Orient {{to go over and}} join them. Graham McMillan arrived in London on the 17th October 1957. The club set him up in ‘digs’ not far from the Orient’s ground, which was located, ironically, in Brisbane Road. In those days the remuneration was not great and players {{at the end of their}} careers <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and had to seek other employment. This situation was brought home to McMillan one Sunday when he was at the ground having a bit of a kick around. McMillan got chatting to a bloke who was sweeping out the stands and it turned out he had been a player of some note and had been captain of the team. When he retired the Club had kept him on as a cleaner.|$|R
