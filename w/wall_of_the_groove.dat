5000|$|Cook Records may be {{best known}} because, in 1952, they were first to produce {{commercial}} stereo records, which Emory Cook called [...] "binaural". About 50 [...] "binaural" [...] recordings were released in all. (The term [...] "binaural sound" [...] {{should not be confused}} with the modern term of that name which describes 'inner-ear-microphone' recordings.) Cook's sound was achieved by putting the output from two separate microphones on two independent monaural tracks on the same side of a record. On these records, the grooves of the first channel formed a single [...] "band" [...] that was concentric with and surrounded a second band that started about halfway into the record and which contained the grooves of the second stereo channel. The V-groove or Westrex stereo LP and cartridge that would become standard, which could play each <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> as a separate track, were not released until 1957. After 1957, Cook also released V-groove stereo recordings as [...] "Cook Vector Stereo". In the intervening years, Cook Labs, Livingston, Audiosphere, and Atlantic all released the two-track binaural disks.|$|E

The circular groove rotates with a constant speed and the temperature on the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> {{is different from the}} temperature inside in the initial time. The effects of thermophoresis and Brownian are considered. The thermal conductivity of the nanofluids is taken as a constant. We solve the model with the finite element method directly and discretize them using a continuous finite element scheme in space and a modified midpoint scheme in time. From the results we can find that the heat transfer enhancement of the nanofluids increases as the power law index of the base fluid decreases...|$|E

40|$|A simple fluid, in a {{microscopic}} capillary capped at one end, is studied {{by means of}} fundamental measure density functional. The model represents a single, infinitely long nanogroove with long-range wall-fluid attractive (dispersion) forces. It is shown that {{the presence or absence}} of hysteresis in adsorption isotherms is determined by wetting properties of the wall as follows: Above wetting temperature, $T_w$, appropriate to a single <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> the adsorption is a continuous process corresponding to a rise of a meniscus from the capped to the open end of the groove. For a sufficiently deep capillary the meniscus rise is shown to be a steep, yet continuous process taking place near the capillary condensation of a corresponding slit. However, for temperatures lower than $T_w$ the condensation exhibits a first-order transition accompanied by hysteresis of the adsorption isotherm. Finally, it is shown that hysteresis may occur even for $T>T_w$ as a consequence of prewetting on the side and bottom walls of the groove...|$|E

After incubation of rat dermal fibroblast (RDFs) on these surfaces for 3 days, the cells were observed with scanning electron (SEM), transmission electron (TEM), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Results showed that the RDFs {{as a whole and}} their stress fibers oriented strictly parallel to the surface pattern on the TiD 01 and TiD 02 surfaces. On the TiD 05 and TiD 10 surfaces, this orientation was not observed. In addition, TEM and CLSM demonstrated that the focal adhesion points (FAP) were located mainly on the surface pattern ridges. TEM revealed that FAP were wrapped occasionally around <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridges.

40|$|AbstractA {{generalised}} view on {{the causes}} leading to humping during high-speed seam welding is proposed.

H 577 P ISE 2016 Chengxxiii, 217 pages :color illustrationsBiomimetic {{structures}} with hydrophobic properties {{have enormous}} potential for applications on artificial self-cleaning surfaces, such as <b>the</b> next generation <b>of</b> vehicle windshields, exterior paint for buildings, and solar panels, {{due to their}} excellent water repellence properties. Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent studies focus on <b>the</b> fabrication methods <b>of</b> hydrophobic surfaces for self-cleaning, and the wetting behavior on self-cleaning surfaces, there are still great challenges in applying one-step manufacturing methods to fabricate bare hydrophobic micro-patterned surfaces with good sliding and optical performance for mass production. This involves fabricating, analyzing, and characterizing micro-patterned surfaces {{taking into account the}} wetting characteristics, droplet wetting states, and optical performance for advanced self-cleaning surfaces. This thesis is divided into four parts. In the first part, optimization modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface geometries <b>of</b> biomimetic structures for self-cleaning has been developed based on an optical function and a wetting model of micro-patterned surfaces, considering hydrophobicity and optical performance. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis describes investigations on <b>the</b> wetting characteristics <b>of</b> bare hydrophobic micro-patterned cyclic olefin copolymer surfaces machined by a one-step fabrication method, ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM), which is potentially applicable for <b>the</b> mass production <b>of</b> plastic injection moldings. Water droplets are governed by the Cassie and Baxter regime, and are stabilized by the sharp edges induced by the numerical-controlled tool path in the material removal process in <b>the</b> mechanical machining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top asperities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micro-patterns after deposition on the surfaces. This results in a good sliding performance on the micro-grooved surfaces. In the third part, a characterization method for the droplet wetting states, significantly affecting its sliding performance on hydrophobic surfaces, is proposed, based on observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> droplet contact lines on the micro-grooved surfaces. This characterization method is capable of identifying intermediate wetting states {{but it is difficult to}} use traditional verification methods for such identification. The partial wetting state is found to be <b>the</b> sliding boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micro-grooved surfaces, whereas droplets contacting <b>the</b> side <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> still form a favorable wetting state for the anisotropic sliding on the micro-grooved surfaces. In the fourth part, <b>the</b> anisotropic wetting <b>of</b> micro-micro hierarchical structured surfaces fabricated by ultra-precision machining, including regular, irregular, and multi-level hierarchical structures, have been investigated. It is found that applying irregular hierarchical structures and multi-level design can further enhance the water static contact angle to over 150 ° and 161 ° respectively. This is achieved by inducing more energy barriers, reducing <b>the</b> contact area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid-liquid interface, and reserving more buffers to air pocket formation. The originality and significance of this research include: (i) an optimization modeling for <b>the</b> surface geometries <b>of</b> biomimetic structures for advanced self-cleaning surfaces has been established; (ii) highly controllable one-step fabrication methods, potentially applicable for mass production in the plastic injection molding of bare micro-patterned surfaces with good sliding and optical performance, are proposed through study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wetting characteristics; (iii) a characterization method for the droplet wetting states, that significantly affect the sliding performance on hydrophobic surfaces, is firstly proposed from observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> droplet contact lines on micro-patterned surfaces; (iv) this characterization method is capable of identifying intermediate wetting states which show the sliding boundary and the favorable wetting state for anisotropic sliding on the micro-grooved surfaces.

40|$|Steam {{turbine rotor}} {{is a very}} {{complicated}} assembly, typically consists of several rotor rows. Due to design limitations and increasing demands on <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam turbines, it is practically impossible to avoid all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resonant states. The significant vibrations can occur, for example, due to passing resonance state during turbine start up or run out. In the worst case the turbine operates state is close to <b>the</b> resonance state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor row. This leads to <b>the</b> significant oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bladed disk, and may results in the blade (or blade to disk joints) high cycle fatigue. These parts are highly loaded components and any cracks are unacceptable. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to damp vibration by using, for example, passive damping elements. The damping element analyzed in this thesis is a strap with an isosceles trapezoidal cross section, which is placed in <b>the</b> circumferential dovetail <b>groove</b> in <b>the</b> blade segmental shrouding. The sliding between the contact surfaces leads to <b>the</b> dissipation <b>of</b> energy which causes decreasing <b>of</b> undesirable vibrations. <b>The</b> main aim is to design <b>the</b> optimal dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strap cross-section {{with a view to}} the most effective damping of vibration for a particular turbine operating state. Considered bladed disk has 54 blades which are coupled in 18 packets by segmental shrouding. The damping element is paced in circumferential dovetail <b>groove</b> created in <b>the</b> shrouding. This type of damping element is suitable especially for damping vibrations in the axial direction and only with the mode shape with the nodal diameters. <b>The</b> modal properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bladed disk are influenced by the sliding distance. Since the friction force depends on centrifugal force acting on the damping element and on <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strap and <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> sliding distance can be influenced by the damping element dimensions. During the optimization process the best possible size of middle width, height and angle of damping element cross-section is searched. The strap weight, contact area size and flexural stiffness of damping element can be influenced by these parameters. Their change has also impact on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact pressure and thus on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> relative motion as well. As stated previously, the damping efficiency is influenced by the relative motion between the damping element and shrouding. Numerical simulation in time domain is very time-consuming, especially for systems containing nonlinearities. In order to verify dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computational model with the passive friction element in numerical simulations, the simplified model is created. The model is created in the ANSYS environment.

To satisfy this requirement the simplified model is a cantilever beam with rectangular cross section. <b>The</b> dovetail <b>groove</b> is created in this model in longitudinal direction.

As the {{necessary}} information for planning tool path, or determining <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> machining processes, <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> shape <b>of</b> impellers should be extracted exactly. A Z-map based approach is proposed to extract <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impeller, which is formed by hub and blades in STL models. <b>The</b> bottom boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> surface are computed with its Z-map models and <b>the</b> polygons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> surface are selected with the boundaries. An experimental system is implemented and some computational experiments are performed to verify <b>the</b> practical applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach...|$|R
