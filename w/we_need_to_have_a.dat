The bill is cosponsored by Senators Don Benton and Pam Roach. Earlier in February, Rivers also introduced legislation attempting to lower restrictions on initiatives in Washington State, commenting, [...] "If the people {{take the time to}} sign their name and say this is something <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> look at, we ought to respect that." [...] Along with cosponsors Roach and Benton, Tim Eyman also is cosponsoring the legislation. In March 2013, Rivers reprimanded senate Democrats for taking advantage of Janéa Holmquist Newbry's departure from the senate floor to feed her newborn son, leaving the Democrats in temporary control of the senate floor. Immediately after she left, Democrat David Frockt attempted to pass a bill through the floor. As part of her duties, Rivers has also hosted high-school aged pages for the Washington State Senate Page Program.|$|E

Romney stated that if he were president he would consult with his lawyers before he came to a conclusive interpretation of the War Powers Clause in the US Constitution. In June 2012 during a Face the Nation interview Romney stated regarding military action against Iran: [...] "I don’t believe at this stage, therefore, if I’m president that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> war powers approval or special authorization for military force." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E
