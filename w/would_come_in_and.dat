25|$|Feet Up Friday - This {{began on}} the {{afternoon}} show. Two teams of listeners <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play games, including 'The Yes/No Game' and 'The Square' to win Feet Up Friday. When Greg moved to drivetime, the feature was reinvented so that the two teams make music choices to be played between 17:15 and 17:45, the winning team, that got to play their choices, was chosen by listener vote. This feature ended when The Official Chart occupied the Friday show.|$|E
500|$|Handling the film's {{special effects}} were KNB EFX GROUP and the Moving Picture Company (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used {{different}} techniques. [...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of {{me from the}} shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{do most of the}} crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Bono recounted another {{experience}} {{he had in}} El Salvador, where {{he had seen a}} body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, [...] "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house.... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> take you and murder you; there would be no trial." [...] Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it. His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and another track from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky".|$|E

500|$|More {{than half}} of the episodes were {{directed}} by Bob Spiers, a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on Fawlty Towers amongst many other programmes. He would work again with Moffat on his sitcom Joking Apart and Murder Most Horrid, and with Sawalha on Absolutely Fabulous. According to Moffat, Spiers was the [...] "principal director" [...] taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used tracking shots, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> [...] "do a Spiers". All of the directors were encouraged to attend the others' shoots so that the visual style would be consistent.|$|E
500|$|The Matrix, who {{produced}} six songs for Lavigne, five of which {{appear in the}} album, had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi", and [...] "I'm with You", which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, [...] "Avril <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> sing a few melodies, change a word here or there." [...] Reid complemented the issue over the credits: [...] "If I'm looking for a single for an artist, I don't care who writes it. Avril had the freedom to do as she really pleased, and the songs show her point of view. ... Avril has always been confident about her ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play back what was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and what I wanted to say to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} quarter Kenny Guiton <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> throw a one-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Chris Fields. [...] Ohio State's final drive of the half would end in a 10-yard touchdown pass from Braxton Miller to freshman Ezekiel Elliott, with the Buckeyes' taking a 42–0 lead into halftime. [...] Guiton would again lead the Buckeyes' into the endzone, this time on the first drive of the third quarter, this time running four yards for the touchdown.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Treder of Hardball Times {{described}} Miller as a [...] "whatever-is-needed utility pitcher". Former teammate Roy Hartsfield, {{who managed}} the Toronto Blue Jays when Miller was the team's pitching coach, called him [...] "The Christian", a nickname he earned [...] "because he suffers so much", noting that Miller was a part-time reliever {{with a sore}} arm, but that [...] "when {{we came up with}} some other sore arms on the staff he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> suffer a few innings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garbage {{completed}} recording by December 1997, as Manson {{wanted to}} return to her family in Scotland for Christmas, and asked her bandmates to just move onto the mixing. Vig added that otherwise more time would be spent recording, and [...] "it was kind of scary—because we had to commit to what these songs were going to become." [...] Production was done until mid-February 1998. The eventual title, Version 2.0, was a tongue-in-cheek take on how computers were heavily involved in the album's production, with Manson adding that [...] "in the studio, at any given moment, someone <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> find the four of us in front of the screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Poland's {{cities and}} larger towns, the Nazi {{occupiers}} created ghettos {{that were designed}} to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to the ghettos condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into the ghettos and smuggling of goods out of the ghettos, organized by Jews and Poles, was {{the only means of}} subsistence of the Jewish population in the ghettos. The price difference between the Aryan [...] and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out the ghettos, usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.|$|E

Many of the kids were forced to grow up too fast, their careers were being decided for them before they were 13. If I went to an audition then they’d always choose the sweetest, prettiest kid. I wasn’t obviously beautiful so I used to miss out." [...] Ullman has also alleged that the owners taught their own children and that a certain level of favouritism seemed to exist. She also felt that the education she was receiving was of very little value. [...] "These stupid teachers <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> go, 'Good morning, darlings, lets all be dustbins!' I'd go, 'Oh, shut up! I wanna be a banana!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in August 2012, {{producer}} Jim Beanz {{reported that}} Timberlake {{started working on}} his new music project. However, at that time, shortly after the announcement, Timberlake's publicist revealed {{that there were no}} current plans for a new Timberlake album, affirming instead that Timberlake was working with Timbaland on songs for his upcoming project Shock Value III. After the release of The 20/20 Experience, Wright confirmed that the album was finished in the middle of July and described it as a [...] "fast record". Timberlake had four weeks to record the whole material, because he had to shoot his scenes for the film Runner Runner. Although, originally planned for release in October 2012, the album's date was postponed because of the singer's wedding with actress Jessica Biel. Wright stated that although in the project were involved artists who are also primarily Timberlake's friends it was tough keeping the album a secret, making them use codenames for the project. During an interview with American radio and television host Ryan Seacrest, Timberlake explained the meaning behind the album's title saying, [...] "It more or less came out of: I was playing some of the stuff for my friends and they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the studio and I'd say, 'What do you think of this?' And my best friend said, 'This is music that you can see,' and for some reason that stuck with me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece {{was a bunch of}} songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg.

2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E
