60|$|We {{love to see}} any redness in the {{vegetation}} of the temperate zone. It {{is the color of}} colors. This plant speaks to our blood. It asks a bright sun on it to make it show to best advantage, and it must be seen at this season of the year. On warm hillsides its stems are ripe by the twenty-third of August. At that date I walked through a beautiful grove of them, six or seven feet high, on the side of one of our cliffs, where they ripen early. Quite to the ground they were a deep brilliant purple with a bloom, contrasting with the still clear green leaves. It appears a rare triumph of Nature to have produced and perfected such a plant, as if this were enough for a summer. What a perfect maturity it arrives at! It is the emblem of a successful life concluded by a death not premature, which is an ornament to Nature. <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to mature as perfectly, root and branch, glowing in the midst of our decay, like the Poke! I confess that it excites me to behold them. I cut one for a cane, for I would fain handle and lean on it. I love to press the berries between my fingers, and see their juice staining my hand. To walk amid these upright, branching casks of purple wine, which retain and diffuse a sunset glow, tasting each one with your eye, instead of counting the pipes on a London dock, what a privilege! For Nature's vintage is not confined to the vine. Our poets have sung of wine, the product of a foreign plant which commonly they never saw, as if our own plants had no juice in them more than the singers. Indeed, this has been called by some the American Grape, and, though a native of America, its juices are used in some foreign countries to improve the color of the wine; so that the poetaster may be celebrating the virtues of the Poke without knowing it. Here are berries enough to paint afresh the western sky, and play the bacchanal with, if you will. And what flutes its ensanguined stems would make, to be used in such a dance! It is truly a royal plant. I could spend the evening of the year musing amid the Poke-stems. And perchance amid these groves might arise at last a new school of philosophy or poetry. It lasts all through September.|$|E

40|$|A {{variance}} swap is {{a derivative}} with a path-dependent payoff which allows investors to take {{positions on the}} future variability of an asset. In the idealised setting of a continuously monitored variance swap written on an asset with continuous paths {{it is well known}} that the variance swap payoff can be replicated exactly using a portfolio of puts and calls and a dynamic position in the asset. This fact forms the basis of the VIX contract. But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in the more realistic setting where the contract is based on discrete monitoring, and the underlying asset may have jumps? We show that it is possible to derive model-independent, no-arbitrage bounds on the price of the variance swap, and corresponding sub- and super-replicating strategies. Further, we characterise the optimal bounds. The form of the hedges depends crucially on the kernel used to define the variance swap. ...|$|R

Political scientists have long been interested in the question of what drives parties to change who represents them, how they run themselves and what they stand for. Until now, however, their work has been confined to fairly abstract cross-national comparisons, on the one hand, and very brief country-case studies on the other. Even so, it casts doubt on the idea that change is always, or even mainly, driven by the ‘external shock’ of defeat and/or loss of office.
