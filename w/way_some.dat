5|$|Super-heavy {{elements}} such as seaborgium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this <b>way,</b> <b>some</b> heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} <b>way</b> <b>some</b> female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this <b>way,</b> <b>some</b> {{of the most serious}} pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E

5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians {{became interested in}} this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed {{that it could be}} used as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise <b>way,</b> <b>some</b> of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky <b>Way,</b> <b>some</b> astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that <b>way.</b> <b>Some</b> of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their <b>way.</b> <b>Some</b> aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
