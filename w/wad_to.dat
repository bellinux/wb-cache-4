50|$|A typical firing {{procedure}} follows. A wet swab {{was used}} to mop out {{the interior of the}} barrel, extinguishing any embers from a previous firing which might set off the next charge of gunpowder prematurely. Gunpowder was placed in the barrel, either loose or in a cloth or parchment cartridge pierced by a metal 'pricker' through the touch hole, and followed by a cloth wad (typically made from canvas and old rope), then rammed home with a rammer. Next the shot was rammed in, followed by another <b>wad</b> <b>to</b> prevent the cannonball from rolling out of the barrel if the muzzle was depressed. The gun in its carriage was then 'run out'; men heaved on the gun tackles until the front of the gun carriage was hard up against the ship's bulwark, the barrel protruding out of the gun port. This took the majority of the gun crew manpower, as the weight of a large cannon in its carriage could total over two tons, and the ship would probably be rolling.|$|E

50|$|A {{historical}} {{use of the}} {{adhesive properties}} of sodium silicates is the production of paper cartridges for black powder revolvers produced by Colt's Manufacturing Company {{during the period from}} 1851 until 1873, especially during the American Civil War. Sodium silicate was used to seal combustible nitrated paper together to form a conical paper cartridge to hold the black powder, as well as to cement the lead ball or conical bullet into the open end of the paper cartridge. Such sodium silicate cemented paper cartridges were inserted into the cylinders of revolvers, thereby speeding the reloading of cap-and-ball black powder revolvers. This use largely ended with the introduction of Colt revolvers employing brass-cased cartridges starting in 1873. Similarly, sodium silicate was also used to cement the top wad into brass shotgun shells, thereby eliminating any need for a crimp {{at the top of the}} brass shotgun shell to hold a shotgun shell together. Reloading brass shotgun shells was widely practiced by self-reliant American farmers during the 1870s, using the same waterglass material that was also used to preserve eggs. The cementing of the top wad on a shotgun shell consisted of applying from three to five drops of waterglass on the top <b>wad</b> <b>to</b> secure it to the brass hull. Brass hulls for shotgun shells were superseded by paper hulls starting around 1877. The newer paper-hulled shotgun shells used a roll crimp in place of a waterglass-cemented joint to hold the top wad in the shell. However, whereas brass shotshells with top wads cemented with waterglass could be reloaded nearly indefinitely (given powder, wad, and shot, of course), the paper hulls that replaced the brass hulls could be reloaded only a few times.|$|E

The object of the social work, apart from offering sympathetic support, <b>wad</b> <b>to</b> make contact with those who would be receptive to aid in the homes provided for derelict men and women. The author devoted great attention understanding the problems of the individual derelicts in depth, rather than make superficial contacts with the general group. A superficial survey of derelicts is of little heuristic value in appreciating their situation. An accurate sociological analysis should serve to uncover the underlying causes and processes of the condition. This appreciation must be achieved through extended contact and interpretation, rather than through questionnaires of an analysis of economic conditions, which are of secondary importance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA walking assist device (WAD) with {{bodyweight}} support reduces {{energy expenditure}} of a walking person. However, {{it is also}} important that the location of actuators in the WAD will be optimally chosen. For this purpose a wearable assist device composed of a bodyweight support, legs and shoes articulated with hip (upper joint), knee (middle joint), and ankle (lower joint) is discussed. Since human walk involves large displacements only in sagittal plane, a planar model is considered. In order to evaluate the optimal distribution of input torques, a bipedal model of a seven-link system with several walking velocities is coupled with the mentioned <b>WAD.</b> <b>To</b> study the efficiency of the WAD and to choose an appropriate actuation, the torque cost is evaluated when the same walking pattern are tracked with and without a WAD. The paper deals with the torque cost for the human and the WAD with several types of actuation. It is shown that full actuation with six motors or partial actuation with two motors located at the upper joints are two more efficient solutions while an actuation at the middle joints or lower joints only is ineffective. The numerical simulations carried out for several walking velocities confirm the mentioned observations...|$|E
40|$|Background: A low {{adherence}} {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} for the development of drug resistant Tuberculosis. One of the identified factors connected to adherence is the relations between health care personal and patient.

Aim: The aim of this study <b>wad</b> <b>to</b> explore how the Namibian nurses experienced adherence to treatment in patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Method: A qualitative research technic was used to collect data. The interview questions were constructed in a semi-structure with partly opened questions. The data was analysed with Graneheim and Lundman (2004) analysis model. Result: Strategies that was used by the nurses to enable a high adherence was providing information, counselling and education to the patient together with a practical support of delegating DOTS and providing the patient with medicine. There was a divided opinion on how to communicate with the patient depending on the nurse fundamental view of adherence. A doctor centred view resulted in a one way communication by informing the patient. A patient centred view of adherence resulted in a two way communication when the nurse aimed to learn about the patient own point of views. Conclusion: To enable a high adherence there has to be a two way communication which demands high communicational skills from the nurse...|$|E
