Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: [...] "Cruelty to a cow {{is the same as}} cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm." [...] He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a brass plate {{at the front of the}} cow's stall). The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried. Workers would milk into a fine <b>wire</b> <b>strainer</b> placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.|$|E

50|$|Hayes Engineering, located {{immediately}} {{southwest of}} the township, was once the home to Ernest Hayes, a farmer and flour miller who began producing and selling farm tools from his Oturehua property. Hayes invented the internationally acclaimed <b>wire</b> <b>strainer,</b> as well as pulley blocks, cattle stops and windmills.|$|E
50|$|Hayes' farming {{products}} are now marketed by Tru-Test Ltd and include <b>wire</b> <b>strainers,</b> <b>wire</b> dispensers, fence post tools, crimping tools, crimping sleeves and farm gates.|$|R
50|$|Monel's {{corrosion}} resistance makes it ideal in {{applications such as}} piping systems, pump shafts, seawater valves, trolling <b>wire,</b> and <b>strainer</b> baskets. Some alloys are completely non-magnetic and are used for anchor cable aboard minesweepers, housings for magnetic-field measurement equipment. In recreational boating, Monel wire is used to seize shackles for anchor ropes, Monel is used for water and fuel tanks, and for underwater applications. It is also used for propeller shafts and for keel bolts.|$|R
50|$|Because he was naturalised, until 1940 he was {{prevented}} from working on radar. Because {{he was also}} {{on the list of}} people targeted for retribution by the Nazis his wife and children took up an offer to spend the war in Canada. Simon remained behind in Oxford.In 1940 in collaboration with Nicholas Kurti and Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, he was commissioned by the MAUD Committee to investigate the feasibility of separating uranium-235 by gaseous diffusion. He initially adapted his wife's <b>wire</b> kitchen <b>strainer</b> to assist in this work before commissioning a membrane from ICI containing 160,000 holes to the square inch. His resulting conclusions on the separation of uranium isotopes was transferred to the Manhattan Project and was the basis of the process that produced sufficient U235 to make the atomic bomb. He spent {{the latter part of the}} Second World War at Los Alamos, returning in 1945 to Oxford to continue his low temperature research.|$|R
50|$|In 1895, Hayes {{began to}} {{manufacture}} tools and agricultural equipment, establishing a workshop that became his engineering works. In 1910 Hayes built his first wind turbine {{to power the}} workshop; he replaced this with a Pelton wheel in 1927. Apart from windpumps, developed in 1912, Hayes' principal inventions are various types of <b>wire</b> <b>strainer,</b> used for applying tension to wire fences.|$|E
50|$|The purlins are {{attached}} to eight T-shaped ribs (1¾ × 1¾ × ⅛ inch; 4.5 × 4.5 × 0.5 cm) set at 6 feet 0.5 inch (1.8 m) centres. Each rib consists of three sections bolted together using splice plates, and each end is bolted to the floor at the bearers. With each rib are two straining wires, one on each side, and a straining ratchet (or in some cases a simple fencing <b>wire</b> <b>strainer).</b> The wires are strained during construction. The straining wires do {{not appear in the}} original Nissen patent.|$|E

50|$|The oiling system {{addresses}} {{the need to}} properly lubricate an engine when it’s running. Properly lubricating an engine not only reduces friction between moving parts but is also the main method by which heat is removed from pistons, bearings, and shafts. Failing to properly lubricate an engine will result in engine failure. The oil pump forces the motor oil through the passages in the engine to properly distribute oil to different engine components. In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a <b>wire</b> mesh <b>strainer</b> that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil. The flow made by the oil pump allows the oil to be distributed around the engine. In this system, oil flows through an oil filter and sometimes an oil cooler, before going through the engine’s oil passages and being dispersed to lubricate pistons, rings, springs, valve stems, and more.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{results from a}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the mixing process used to disperse synthetic fibers in wet-lay process. We used CFD software, FLUENT, together with the MIXSIM user interface to accurately model the impeller geometry. A multiple reference frame (MRF) model and standard k-e turbulence model were used to model the problem. After obtaining a converged solution for the mixing tank with water, a discrete phase model was constructed by injecting spherical particles into the flow. A mixing tank with baffles and a centrally located impeller was used in experiments. PET fibers (1. 5 denier, 6. 35, 12. 7, and 38. 7 mm) at a concentration of 0. 01 % were mixed in water for the study. In regions behind the baffles, where the model predicted higher concentration of particles, experimental results showed a 34 % higher concentration relative to {{the region in the}} high turbulence zone near the center. Instantaneous sheets were formed by rapidly dipping and removing a flat <b>wire</b> mesh <b>strainer</b> into the tank at two different locations to assess the state of dispersion in the tank. The sheets were transferred onto a blotting paper and examined under a microscope to count defects. Results show that the number of rope defects was 43 % higher in sheets drawn from the region behind the baffles than in the sheets drawn from regions {{near the center of the}} tank. Changing baffles from a rectangular to a triangular cross section decreased the number of rope defects, but increased the number of log defects in the sample sheets at the same location. The CFD model can be used to optimize mixing tank design for wet lay fiber dispersion. The model provides further insight into the mixing process by predicting the effect of changes in design parameters on dispersion quality...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{began with}} an enquiry into the origins of a {{ubiquitous}} artefact of everyday life in rural New Zealand; the Hayes permanent <b>wire</b> <b>strainer.</b> Researching this artefact quickly revealed that {{the origins of the}} Hayes permanent <b>wire</b> <b>strainer</b> were vastly at odds with popular belief; a belief that somehow enshrined the strainer as symbolic of a particular quality, or qualities, that are commonly regarded as defining characteristics {{of what it means to}} be a New Zealander, namely those of pragmatism and adaptability. The discovery that Hayes did not invent the Hayes permanent <b>wire</b> <b>strainer,</b> led to further research into the notion of design as an evolutionary process, and this in turn, led to an even more more compelling question about the nature of Hayes ‘ work. As with all research led enquiry, this thesis provides more questions than answers but central to the thesis is the proposition that Ernest Hayes was a pioneer of New Zealand industrial design. I hope that the subject matter may prove a useful prompt for other scholars of design history to take up the task of broadening the scope of this discipline to include content from other previously excluded domains such as agricultural tools and equipment...|$|E
