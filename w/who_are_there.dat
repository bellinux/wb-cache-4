25|$|The Hawaiians’ ways of {{learning}} include wide keen {{attention from the}} children while adults are available for guidance, {{also found in the}} model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members. Because the children learn through observation, and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> to assist when needed. It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.|$|E

500|$|S. R. Praveen of The Hindu gave a {{positive}} review: [...] "Syam Pushkaran, {{in writing the}} revenge story, takes away the usual ingredients of hate and anger, and replaces it with lots of humour, arriving as a torrent in one-liners, in situations {{and even in the}} minute gestures of the characters ... Maheshinte Prathikaram provides clean entertainment, treading new paths in that endeavour. If revenge comes like this, let's have more of it". He praised Pothan's direction and Faasil's performance. Sify also had {{a positive}} review: [...] "It's not often that you come across such an intelligent comedy that is extremely funny, thoroughly gripping and brilliantly packaged". The reviewer praised the performances: [...] "One of the best things about this one is the performance of every artiste, both in main roles and also those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> even in a scene or so". Also praising the screenplay, cinematography, and music, the review concluded: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaram is one of the finest comedies to have happened in Malayalam during recent years".|$|E

500|$|From a gate inside Clock Tower, Link and Tatl enter Clock Town {{while its}} {{population}} prepares for the town's annual Carnival of Time also {{scheduled to take}} place in three days. Together they learn that the Skull Kid is waiting {{at the top of the}} tower, which is only accessible during the eve of the carnival. After conditions are met, Link and Tatl arrive at the top of the Clock Tower to witness Tael hurriedly speak a riddle to them: [...] "Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon... hurry, the four <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>there...</b> bring them here!" [...] Link is unable to fight the Skull Kid, nor does he have any means to take the mask from him, but manages to get the Ocarina of Time back from his hands. After playing the [...] "Song of Time" [...] on the ocarina, Link and Tatl are brought backwards through time three days earlier — with the ocarina still in his possession and with both him and Tatl having complete memory of all that happened. Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again, he sees that Link has retrieved his ocarina, and hence teaches him the [...] "Song of Healing", which breaks the curse, returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed. After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant he has set free. To accomplish this, he uses the [...] "Song of Healing" [...] to create a mask that can turn him into a Goron from the spirit of a deceased Goron hero, and a mask that can turn him into a Zora from the spirit of a brave deceased Zora.|$|E
