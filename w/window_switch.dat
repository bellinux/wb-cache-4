25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power <b>window</b> <b>switch</b> panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels.

40|$|<b>Switching</b> between <b>windows</b> on a {{computer}} is a frequent activity, but finding and switching to the target window can be inefficient. This thesis aims to better un-derstand and support <b>window</b> <b>switching.</b> It explores two issues: (1) the {{lack of knowledge of}} how people currently interact with and <b>switch</b> between <b>windows</b> and (2) how <b>window</b> <b>switching</b> can be supported better. Having a good understanding of how users interact with windows is important for informing the design of new and improved window management tools. How-ever, there have been relatively few empirical studies of window manipulation on commonly used operating systems, and those that do exist may no longer reflect current use. To address this lack of knowledge a three week log-based longitudi-nal study of window use by 25 participants was conducted using the custom-made tool PyLogger, which recorded actual <b>window</b> <b>switching</b> behaviour. However, the analysis of longitudinal log data, such as the data gathered by PyLogger, is problematic as it is difficult to extract meaningful characterisations. Therefore, this thesis also presents a visualisation tool called Window Watcher that assists understanding and interpreting the low level event logs of window use generated by PyLogger. Window Watcher’s design objectives are described, and examples demonstrate the ways that it summarises and elucidates window use. The results of the PyLogger study provide an empirical characterisation of in-teraction with windows, and results include the following: (1) the participants had fewer windows open and visible than in previous studies; (2) <b>window</b> <b>switching</b> is a frequent activity; (3) several findings related to specific <b>window</b> <b>switching</b> tools, including that acquiring a particular window by navigating through application-grouped items on the Taskbar is slow, and that Alt+Tab is seldom used for re-trieving anything other than the most recently used window; (4) an updated clas-sification of stereotypical window management styles pilers, maximisers, near maximisers, and splatterers); and (5) there are strong window and application re-visitation patterns. Finally, implications {{of the results of the}} log study for the design of <b>window</b> <b>switching</b> tools are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Power windows {{have come}} under some {{scrutiny}} after several fatal accidents in which children's necks have become trapped, leading to suffocation. Some designs place the switch in a location on a hand rest {{where it can be}} accidentally triggered by a child climbing to place his or her head out of the window. To prevent this, many vehicles feature a driver-controlled lockout switch, preventing rear-seat passengers (usually smaller children) from accidentally triggering the switches. This also prevents children from using them as toys and pets riding with their heads out windows from activating the power <b>window</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On October 10, 2012, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of 7.43 million vehicles (2.47 {{million in the}} US, 460,000 in Japan, 1.39 million in Europe, 3.11 million in other markets) worldwide.

In Japan the recall affects MY 2005-2010 Vitz, Belta, Ractis, Ist and Corolla Rumion. In Europe the recall affects MY 2005-2010 Yaris, Corolla, Auris, Camry and RAV-4.

50|$|The Streetwise {{offered a}} choice of sporty interiors, {{available}} in four or five seats (optional). The standard four seats had two separate rear seats and a separating centre console, and were half leather body-hugging seats.

The electric <b>window</b> <b>switch</b> had been relocated next to the handbrake, with new-style rocker switch, in a circular design with chrome effect plastic in the middle.

The luggage capacity was described as average (12.6 cubic ft/357 litres).

The Q45's use of a Cloisonné insignia instead of a conventional grille also caused buyers to shy away because of its unconventional, bottom breather appearance, and may have been influenced from the first generation Ford Taurus, the 1994 model year update featured a more conventional appearance including a more traditional appearing grille, woodgrain/chrome interior trim and cushy seats, drawing influences from the Nissan Maxima. More sedate performance figures, slower 17:1 steering (except on the Q45t, which retained the original 15.1:1 ratio), lower ratio 1st and 2nd gears, and a dynamically smooth suspension were all added in 1993 to make it a more status-quo luxury sedan. Other changes include thicker glass, keyless remote, auto-dim rear-view mirror, dipping side view mirrors, an improved transmission heat exchanger and external ATF filter, new oval intake ports and revised disc injectors, and fog lights. Metal-backed camshaft timing chain guides were added in 1993 to replace the earlier model's less reliable plastic guides.|$|E

40|$|Window {{management}} {{research has}} aimed to leverage users’ tasks {{to organize the}} growing number of open windows in a useful manner. This research has largely assumed task classifications to be binary — either a window is in a task, or not — and context-independent. We suggest that the continual evolution of tasks can invalidate this approach and instead propose a fuzzy association model in which windows are related to one another by varying degrees. Task groupings are an emergent property of our approach. To support the association model, we introduce the WindowRank algorithm and its use in determining window association.
