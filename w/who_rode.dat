5|$|Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> {{the express}} trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute {{uprising}} of 1860 he was chased by {{a band of}} Paiute Indians on horseback {{and was forced to}} retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many passengers <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Léon Bollée and his family. Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollée would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E
60|$|There are {{two classes}} of women <b>who</b> <b>ride</b> to hounds, or, rather, among many {{possible}} classifications, there are two to which I will now call attention. There is the lady <b>who</b> <b>rides,</b> and demands assistance; {{and there is the}} lady <b>who</b> <b>rides,</b> and demands none. Each always, I may say always, receives all the assistance that she may require; but the difference between the two, to the men <b>who</b> <b>ride</b> with them, is very great. It will, of course, be understood that, as to both these samples of female Nimrods, I speak of ladies <b>who</b> really <b>ride,</b> not of those who grace the coverts with, and disappear under the auspices of, their papas or their grooms when the work begins.|$|R

5|$|The {{carriages}} operated as electric {{multiple unit}} trains without separate locomotives. Passengers boarded {{and left the}} trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of}} cars; these gates were operated by gate-men <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design was subsequently used for the GNP and the CCE, and became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock. Trains for the line were stabled at the London Road depot south of Kennington Road station.|$|E

5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the United States Post Office {{issued the}} first U.S. Postage stamp to depict an actual {{historic}} event, {{and the subject}} that was chosen was the Pony Express. Until then only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson {{were found on the}} face of U.S. Postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the 'Pony Express Stamp' issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960 commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express respectively.|$|E

Tolkien was very {{devoted to his}} children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} division called {{for two of the}} airborne battalions to march through Oslo on 10 May, but the delay meant that only a few troops had arrived by this date. Instead, two platoons from 2nd Battalion The South Staffordshire Regiment and four Military Policemen on motorcycles accompanied Urquhart, <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> in a commandeered German staff car. The soldiers, although somewhat nervous given the small size of their group, were greeted enthusiastically by the Norwegian population in Oslo. The only resistance came from the captains of several U-boats at Trondheim. Apart from this, 1st Airborne Division encountered no trouble from the German forces in Norway, who co-operated fully with the airborne troops. They were disarmed without problem, allowed themselves to be transferred to collection camps and also assisted in the clearing of numerous minefields they had sown during their occupation, which resulted in several German casualties.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, <b>who</b> <b>rode</b> {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E
