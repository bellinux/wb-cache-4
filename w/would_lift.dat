5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene did not end up being created for the film.|$|E

5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-15th century, a {{civil war}} broke out among the Togashi clan over the {{position}} of shugo. Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother, Kochiyo. When the Ōnin War broke out in 1467, Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with Yamana. In 1473, Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga, the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, {{as well as from}} the priests of Yoshizaki, who were associated with Rennyo. Masachika promised the ikki that if restored to power, he <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> his supporters out of their poverty. Further motivating the ikki to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo: Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinshū sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji. Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo. Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests, and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikkō-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother. But Ikkō-ikki support of Masachika was short-lived. By 1474, the Ikkō-ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill his promises of economic reward, and they attempted a rebellion. Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in Etchū Province. In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E

25|$|Abraham Lincoln's patent is {{a patent}} for an {{invention}} to lift boats over shoals and obstructions in a river.

After the vote the Suwon District Court issued a warrant against Lee Seok-ki, and the arrest was made by the National Intelligent Service in a speedy manner. In executing the warrant at Lee's office in the National Assembly, NIS investigators had nearly an hour-long confrontation with vehemently-resisting UPP members who blocked the path to Lee's Office.|$|E
25|$|These {{modifications}} helped, but {{the demand}} for new automobiles outpaced the railroads' abilities to build and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad experimented with modifying a group of -long wood-frame flat cars to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile-loading assemblies that <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> one or more automobiles above others within a boxcar. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies {{that could only be}} loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars.|$|E

25|$|The task of 13th Corps was {{to cross}} the Straits and land in two small bays north of Reggio. The 1st Canadian Division, landing at Fox Beach, a short {{distance}} north of Reggio, were to capture {{the town and the}} airfield south of town, while 5th Division took San Giovanni, to the north, and the coastline to Canitello. The artillery barrage on the beach was planned {{to take advantage of the}} LCA's splinter-proof armoured protection. The barrage <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> from the beach only moments before touchdown for the LCAs. Apart from some craft landing in the wrong places, and some mixing of the divisions, the assault troops landed without difficulty and with little hindrance from the enemy. Following the assault phase, the LCAs were used to ferry supplies. By the evening of D+1 the landing of supplies had gone so well that the build-up was 1½ days ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the Union in late 1862 and early 1863. Although the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had been repulsed at Antietam, it had escaped intact and had inflicted a major defeat on the Federal Army of the Potomac at Fredericksburg, Virginia, {{following}} which the Army of the Potomac was in disarray. In the West, the campaign {{for control of the}} Mississippi River seemed to be bogged down before Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederates had actually managed to retake Galveston, Texas. A mood of war-weariness was evident throughout the North, and the fall elections, regarded as a referendum on the war, had shown a swing away from the Republican party. The Lincoln Administration therefore began to apply great pressure on its field commanders to achieve some success that <b>would</b> <b>lift</b> the national spirit. It was in this atmosphere that the Navy Department began to urge an attack on Charleston.|$|E
