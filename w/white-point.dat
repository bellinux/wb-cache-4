50|$|Mythimna albipuncta, the <b>white-point,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is {{distributed}} throughout Europe and one subspecies is found in Tunisia. It {{is also found in}} Asia Minor, Armenia, and Iran.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a calibration-based auto white balance method for digital still camera. The main {{idea is to}} detect white-points in an image accurately. <b>White-Point</b> Color Temperature Curve (WPCTC) is constructed from sensor calibration and is utilized to estimate <b>white-point</b> locations in a scene. Minimum Color Temperature Distance (MCTD) with a luminance threshold is defined to further locate white-points of an image exactly. Our proposed method is performed in RGB color space so it is suitable for digital still camera pipeline design. In our experiments, our approach is compared with other white balance methods and performs better in color consistency...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the current}} state of CIECAM 97 s, there is a missing {{adjustment}} associated with a black-point unlike a <b>white-point.</b> As an attempt to improve the performance of CIECAM 97 s for color reproduction, six algorithms focusing on “black-point adaptation ” were generated based on previous work on <b>white-point</b> adaptation methods and gamut mapping methods. The six algorithms were used to reproduce four original images targeted to four simulated hard-copy viewing environments that were only differentiated by their black-point settings. Then, the six algorithms were tested in a psychophysical experiment with 32 observers. As a result, linear lightness rescaling under the luminances of white and black of a specific setting was demonstrated to be the best color reproduction method across different black-point settings. The adapted blackpoint was defined as having the lowest lightness value with its default chromatic appearance correlates predicted by {{the current state of}} CIECAM 97 s under the input viewing environment and was reproduced accordingly with the same appearance correlates...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{calculate}} sets of RGB primaries that are <b>white-point</b> independent and have suitable gamut properties when evaluated with regards to surface colors. These primaries {{can be used as}} a basis for defining an output-referred color encoding intended for print applications. The resulting RGB sensors are sharp, i. e. decorrelated, emphasizing again that for imaging applications, the choice of a chromatic adaptation transform based on sharp sensors might be most appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Color images often must be color {{balanced}} {{to remove}} unwanted color casts. We extend previous work on using a neural network for illumination, or <b>white-point,</b> estimation {{from the case}} of calibrated images to that of uncalibrated images of unknown origin. The {{results show that the}} chromaticity of the ambient illumination can be estimated with an average CIE Lab error of 5 DE. Comparisons are made to the grayworld and white patch methods...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that after viewing a {{coloured}} stimulus the perception of subsequent stimuli is chromatically shifted in the opponent direction, because of biased output of early chromatic mechanisms. Recent studies [1, 2] show that known colours of familiar objects affect the perception of those objects, biasing the <b>white-point</b> in the direction opposite that of the memory colour. We investigated whether familiar object colours cause an after-effect by adapting observers to greyscale images of objects with diagnostic colour, before measuring the perceived <b>white-point</b> of simple geometric stimuli. In control measurements the adapting images were phase-scrambled. Despite the measurements being made with judgements of simple geometric stimuli, chromatic shifts were observed relative to control measurements, consistent with adaptation to the colour implied by the objects. Our experiment was designed to eliminate potential response bias. These results could be interpreted as adaptation of colour-signalling mechanisms via top-down input, in the context of colour constancy mechanisms in which the greyscale images are assumed {{to be the result of}} a prevailing illuminant with a colour complementary to the object colour. 1.

40|$|The <b>White-Point</b> Preserving Least Squares (WPPLS) {{algorithm}} {{is a method}} for colour correction that constrains the white point to be exactly mapped into its correct XYZ equivalent. For printers, however, the mapping is from device coordinates to colorimetric densities: the device white is thus mapped into a zero vector and the WPPLS method cannot go forward. Here we use a polynomial regression model and specify that both white (the zero vector) and an average grey be exactly mapped. Moreover we extend the method to accurately but approximately map a subspace of the entire achromatic curve, thus reproducing the neutral tones with far greater accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{over the}} last decade resulted in significant improvements in the LCD's viewing angle performance. Consequently, the current method to define the viewing cone, with a fixed contrast ratio, does not represent perceived performance differences between displays. Our previous study, with two LCDs and a plasma display, revealed that changes in image quality with viewing angle are predicted by combining luminance variations and <b>white-point</b> shifts for an intermediate grey level. In this paper, we show that, for viewers comparing the viewing angle dependent quality between displays, that same relation holds. If the calculated viewing angle is larger than the measured acceptability threshold, the remaining quality at the threshold angle serves as a viewing angle performance indicator. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Digitally, {{panoramic}} pictures can {{be assembled}} from several individual, overlapping photographs. While the geometric alignment of these photographs has retained {{a lot of}} attention from the computer vision community, the mapping of colour, i. e. the correction of colour mismatches, has not been studied extensively. In this article, we analyze the colour rendering of today’s digital photographic systems, and propose a method to correct for colour differences. The colour correction consists in retrieving linearized relative scene referred data from uncalibrated images by estimating the Opto-Electronic Conversion Function (OECF) and correcting for exposure, <b>white-point,</b> and vignetting variations between the individual pictures. Different OECF estimation methods are presented and evaluated in conjunction with motion estimation. The resulting panoramas, shown on examples using slides and digital photographs, yield much-improved visual quality compared to stitching using only motion estimation. Additionally, we show that colour correction can also improve the geometrical alignment...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} color values {{measured by}} color devices (e. g. scanners, color copiers and color cameras) in a device [...] independent fashion these values must be transformed to colorimetric tristimulus values. Often {{it is assumed}} that RGBs are approximately linearly related to XYZs and so this transformation is determined by least [...] squares (LS) linear regression. While the LS method is guaranteed to minimize the residual squared error it makes no a priori statement about which colors will be mapped well and which will be mapped poorly. However, we argue that such a statement must be made. In particular because it is important to preserve the white and the gray-scale in color reproduction, we argue that achromatic colors should be preserved in color correction. This argument led us to develop a new regression procedure: the <b>white-point</b> preserving least-squares fit (WPPLS). As the name might suggest, this method finds the linear transform which maps RGBs to XYZs such that the residual square [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} several years, the {{development}} of new materials and device structures in the field of small molecule organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have led to the demonstration of highly efficient single color devices. Therefore, as the next step, white OLEDs which combine multi-ple colors into one device are promising to become the future light sources for large area light emision, e. g. in display backlighting or illumination. We present first data on such devices that include two or three emis-sion layers of different color into our well established p-i-n structure with electrically doped charge transport layers. We discuss their electro-optical properties like CIE color coordinates, color rendering and the important issue of power efficiency. Detailed studies on the charge carrier transport and balance are carried out to find optimum conditions both for electri-cal properties and color matching. We show that the <b>white-point</b> can be matched by following the three color approach. The aim of high power efficiency is followed by the preferred application of triplet emitters...|$|E
40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} transforms {{are used}} in imaging system to map image appearance to colorimetry under different illumination sources. In this paper, the performance of different chromatic adaptation transforms (CAT) is compared {{with the performance of}} transforms based on RGB primaries that have been investigated in relation to standard color spaces for digital still camera characterization and image interchange. The chromatic adaptation transforms studied are von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and CMCCAT 2000. The RGB primaries investigated are ROMM, ITU-R BT. 709, and 'prime wavelength' RGB. The chromatic adaptation model used is a von Kries model that linearly scales post-adaptation cone response with illuminant dependent coefficients. The transforms were evaluated using 16 sets of corresponding color dat. The actual and predicted tristimulus values were converted to CIELAB, and three different error prediction metrics, (Delta) ELab, (Delta) ECIE 94, and (Delta) ECMC(1 : 1) were applied to the results. One-tail Student-t tests for matched pairs were calculated to compare if the variations in errors are statistically significant. For the given corresponding color data sets, the traditional chromatic adaptation transforms, Sharp CAT and CMCCAT 2000, performed best. However, some transforms based on RGB primaries also exhibit good chromatic adaptation behavior, leading to the conclusion that <b>white-point</b> independent RGB spaces for image encoding can be defined. This conclusion holds only if the linear von Kries model is considered adequate to predict chromatic adaptation behavior...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the difference in}} light reflection of oral mucosa covering titanium (Ti) or zirconia (ZrO 2) abutments {{as it relates to}} the thickness of the covering mucosa. Material and methods: Fifteen anterior implants (Astra Osseo speed (R)) in 11 patients were fitted with a Ti or a ZrO 2 abutment (cross-over, within-subject comparison). Hyper-spectral images were taken with a camera fitted on a surgical microscope. High-resolution images with 70 nm interval between 440 and 720 nm were obtained within 30 s (1392 x 1024 pixels). Black- and <b>white-point</b> reference was used for spatial and spectral normalization as well as correction for motion during exposure. Reflection spectra were extracted from the image on a line mid-buccal of the implant, starting 1 mm above the soft tissue continuing up to 3 mm apically. Results: Median soft tissue height is 2. 3 mm (min: 1. 2 mm and max: 3. 1 mm). The buccal mucosa rapidly increases in the thickness, when moving apically. At 2. 2 mm, thickness is 3 mm. No perceivable difference between the Ti and ZrO 2 abutment can be observed when the thickness of the mucosa is 2 +/- 0. 1 mm (95 % confidence interval) or more. Conclusion: It is expected that the difference in light reflection of soft tissue covering Ti or ZrO 2 abutments is no longer noticeable for the human eye when the mucosa thickness exceeds 2 mm. Haemoglobin peaks in the reflection spectrum can be observed and make hyper-spectral imaging a practical and useful tool for measuring soft tissue health...|$|E
