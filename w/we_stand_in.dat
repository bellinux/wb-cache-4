25|$|The {{original}} Yellowcard members, Ben Harper, Warren Cooke, Todd Clary, Longineu Parsons, and Ben Dobson, {{announced they}} would be performing tracks from Where <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
2500|$|... : Foreign {{minister}} Nasser Gouda said [...] "Jordan's {{position has}} always been to denounce terrorism, and <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> solidarity with our friends in Belgium during this difficult time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... : President John Dramani Mahama has {{condemned}} the terrorist bombings in Brussels. He said [...] "Suicide bombing in Brussels. Another cowardly attack on innocent civilians. <b>We</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> solidarity with Belgium. We {{would not be}} intimidated." ...|$|E
50|$|By {{his dead}} smile I knew <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> Hell.|$|R
60|$|As {{we reached}} the {{courtyard}} <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the shadows beneath the balcony {{for a moment to}} discuss our plans.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily I obeyed him, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> {{the shadow}} of the great funnel. The captain had reached the rail.|$|R
2500|$|The American-Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) {{was formed}} in March 2003. The group advocates a liberal Islam, {{compatible}} with democracy and American values. The AIFD publicly supports Israel, stating [...] "it is necessary to make a foundational position statement regarding the state of Israel. <b>We</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> support of the existing unqualified recognition {{of the state of}} Israel behind internationally recognized borders".|$|E
2500|$|... : President Barack Obama {{stated in}} Havana, Cuba, that [...] "the {{thoughts}} and prayers of the American people are {{with the people of}} Belgium and <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> solidarity with them", adding [...] "we will do whatever is necessary to help our friend and ally Belgium in bringing to justice those responsible." [...] Obama also issued an Executive Order calling for American flags to be lowered to half-staff until Friday, 25 March 2016.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't know,' stammered Brass, who perhaps had {{his reasons}} for wishing to show as fair as {{possible}} {{in the eyes of the}} notary. 'How do <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> point of time, constable, eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|Wolf Larsen had {{returned}} to the poop, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> a silent group, watching the lights rapidly cross our bow.|$|R
6000|$|... “We’d {{have known}} how <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> another hour,” Bethune grumbled, {{shifting}} his grasp {{on the wheel}} to ease his sore wrist.|$|R
60|$|The ashes floated noiselessly to {{the rocky}} floor, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> awed silence and watched them fall, too {{overcome}} for words.|$|R
6000|$|He saith, [...] "That {{the same}} spirit that was in Miriam, is also in all God's {{servants}} for the same end, both to pray for mercies <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> need of, and to praise God for mercies received." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{without waiting}} for an answer, she went on: [...] "Come, let us be setting forth, for we have far to go, and before another day is born in yonder blue should <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> the place of Life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That must be {{for another}} night," [...] said Galazi. [...] "We have not done so ill for once. Now let us search for pots and corn, of which <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> need, {{and then to the}} {{mountain}} before dawn finds us." ...|$|E
6000|$|On afternoons of drowsy calm [...] <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the {{panelled}} pew, Singing one-voiced a Tate-and-Brady psalm [...] To {{the tune}} of [...] "Cambridge New." ...|$|R
60|$|I led the {{way through}} a {{thousand}} ancient tombs, till <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the shadow of Ur the Great, and gazed at his red heaven-piercing mass.|$|R
60|$|Our knives, a few sundries, {{such as a}} compass, matches, {{a pocket}} filter, tobacco, a trowel, a bottle of brandy, and the clothes <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "Come lend us your assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> need of characters--all of us--ha! ha! ha!" [...] and {{as this was}} seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.|$|E
6000|$|... "'My friends, we {{have indeed}} made a {{discovery}} here. We {{have found in}} a palpable, compact, and imperishable state what the wisest of our fathers always regarded as a mere thing of the imagination. Humble yourselves, my friends, for <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a majestic presence. These are parallels of latitude!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear brother," [...] {{said she}} earnestly, [...] "let us go! We belong nowhere. We have not {{a foot of}} space in any church to kneel upon; but let us go to some place of worship, even if <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> the broad aisle. Poor and forsaken as we are, some pew-door will be opened to us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{impossible}} {{for us to go}} back five years? Is {{it impossible}} for us to go back to where <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> those old days at Godolphin Court?" ...|$|R
60|$|Something in {{her eyes}} {{told me that she}} wished me to follow her, and I did so. Outside the portico where <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the desolate, lighted street, she halted.|$|R
60|$|In {{another place}} the phrase: “At night <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> again,” arrested my languid attention, {{because it was}} a sea phrase. “Let’s see what it is all about,” I thought, without excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... § 3. Thus far of Descriptive Terminology, {{or of the}} {{language}} requisite for placing on record our observation of individual instances. But when we proceed from this to Induction, or rather to that comparison of observed instances which is the preparatory step toward it, <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> need of an additional and {{a different sort of}} general names.|$|E
60|$|Did I {{say that}} there was no feeling like it? Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this when <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> the perfected vigor of our life and feel that Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.|$|E
60|$|To the Parisian common man, meanwhile, {{one thing}} remains inconceivable: that now when the Bastille is down, and French Liberty restored, grain should {{continue}} so dear. Our Rights of Man are voted, Feudalism and all Tyranny abolished; yet behold <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> queue! Is it Aristocrat forestallers; a Court still bent on intrigues? Something is rotten, somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... “You might {{remove the}} handcuffs,” {{he said that}} night, as <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> {{consultation}} over him. “It’s dead safe. I’m a paralytic now. The next thing {{to watch out for}} is bed sores.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the Inn Yard {{while she}} pointed out her luggage to me, {{and when it was}} all {{collected}} I remembered--having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught the}} hand <b>in</b> his, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> that connexion, {{looking at each}} other. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> so, a long time; long {{enough for me to}} see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and leave it a deeper red.|$|R
6000|$|Since Death has {{delivered}} us utterly, naked and [...] white, Since {{the month of}} childhood is over, and we stand [...] alone, Since the beloved, faded moon that set us alight Is delivered from us and pays no heed though we [...] moan In sorrow, since <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> bewilderment, strange And fearful to sally forth down the sky's long range.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I found how {{far apart}} <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> {{one kind of}} social scale, and perhaps that ought to have overthrown all hope; but, Phoebe, it will not do so! I will not ask you to share want and privation, but I will and do ask {{you to be the}} point towards which I may work, the best earthly hope set before me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duc de Bouillon {{has lost}} his equipage; our Hussars took it at Landau [other side the Rhine, a while ago]. Here <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> mud to the ears; fifteen of the Regiment Alt-Baden have sunk {{altogether}} in the mud. Mud comes of a water-spout, or sudden cataract of rain, there was in these Heidelberg Countries; two villages, Fuhrenheim and Sandhausen, it swam away, every stick of them (GANZ UND GAR).|$|E
60|$|Some {{minutes later}} the clouds broke and the great moon was seen riding low down in a clear sky, illumining the grave mound and all the plain, save where <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> {{the shadow of the}} mount.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{notice of}} this, <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in,</b> and came all to an anchor {{in the very}} creek; and, sending our boats up the creek, found the water {{perfectly}} fresh and very good upon the ebb, about a league up the river.|$|R
60|$|This he {{proceeded}} to do. Fascinated, I listened with a sickening sensation. It was a mild afternoon <b>in</b> spring, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the deep limestone gutter {{in front of the}} parsonage, a little Gothic wooden house set in a gloomy yard.|$|R
