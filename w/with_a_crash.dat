5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann flew {{his first}} combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they {{encountered}} 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed {{by the idea}} of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, {{but by the end of}} 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E

50|$|The GameCube version, however, has one {{additional}} {{ending with the}} islanders not building a monument this time, but instead a large rocket that blasts them up into space.

The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939 when a lightning bolt struck the tower and caused five people—a celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop—to vanish from the elevator. The television then turns off and the guests are directed through to the boiler room, where they await the maintenance service elevator's arrival.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 Giro d'Italia saw the {{emergence}} of a new star, Alfredo Binda. Despite winning six legs of the event, Costante Girardengo did not win the race. Binda gained the lead after the fifth stage, after he and a few other general classification contenders attacked while Girardengo was repairing a flat tire. Binda won the Giro in his first attempt. Reigning champion Binda started off the following year's race <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in the first stage, which caused him to lose lots of time. Due to the crash, Binda worked as a domestique for his teammate Giovanni Brunero. With Binda's aid, Brunero won the whole event, while Binda won six stages.|$|E

25|$|As {{the ship}} turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash.</b> Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Malick is {{introduced}} {{on the verge}} of being fired from Holby City Hospital, after assaulting his boss on the Day Care Surgical ward. He explains to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that it was necessary to save a patient: resuscitation had been abandoned, but after forcefully taking control of the situation, Malick was able to revive them. On the proviso that he attends anger management counselling, Hanssen gives Malick a final chance and attaches him to the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). There, he soon clashes with the unit's staff: consultant Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), Foundation doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood), and ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). Relations begin to improve when Malick is left in charge of the unit for the day. Although he initially dismisses Penny's diagnoses and advice, ultimately he is forced to call on Michael for help and realises that she was right all along. He also becomes Frieda's mentor when she is accepted onto the Foundation programme. A racist patient makes a complaint about Malick; when her condition rapidly deteriorates in theatre, he walks out, causing the junior AAU staff to believe he has abandoned them. Malick soon returns <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> team and saves the patient's life. Penny develops a crush on him, but Frieda informs her he is gay.|$|E

5000|$|Hope For Men is a 2007 album by Pissed Jeans.

500|$|This was {{the first}} episode of the series written by Frank Spotnitz. Spotnitz, {{who came up with}} the idea to bring back Samantha Mulder in [...] "Colony", wrote this episode, his first {{credited}} work on the show. According to Spotnitz, he along with Chris Carter, were overly ambitious when writing this episode. Since this was Spotnitz's debut as a television writer, he got significant help from Carter to put the script together. All of the scenes originally pitched by Spotnitz were kept, except for a car chase scene that ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash,</b> and one where Mulder mistakes a federal marshal for the bounty hunter. The scenes were cut due to time restraints during filming. [...] Spotnitz later became a frequent collaborator on many of the subsequent mythology episodes of the show, as well as co-writing the two feature films.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} the B2 school Graf was, {{at the age of}} 26, {{initially}} thought to be too old for fighter pilot training and was selected for the C school for transport pilots. On 31 May 1939, Graf passed officer-candidate training at Neubiberg. Because the fighter force was in dire need for new officers, Unteroffizier (a rank equivalent to sergeant) Graf was then transferred to 2. Staffel (2nd squadron) of I./Jagdgeschwader 51 (I./JG51—1st group of the 51st fighter wing) at Bad Aibling [...] At this time I./JG51 was equipped with one of the leading fighter aircraft of the time, the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-1. Graf, who had never flown a modern fighter aircraft before, ended his first flight in a Bf109 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash.</b> When I./JG51 was briefly reequipped with the Czech-built Avia B-534 biplane in July 1939, it gave Graf an opportunity to prove his flying expertise as well as to restore his self-confidence.|$|E
500|$|During {{practice}} for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond set the fastest unofficial practice speed of the month, besting even race favorite Johnny Rutherford in the vaunted Chaparral. His hopes for the pole were dashed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in morning practice {{on the first day}} of qualifying. After repairs he qualified 19th for the race. He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. [...] "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," [...] he said. [...] "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio... at Michigan I cut one in two. I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt. So when I got an offer to drive stock cars, I took it, and it turned out I liked driving them better." ...|$|E

500|$|The race {{took place}} in windy weather. Combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash,</b> these {{conditions}} caused the peloton to break into several groups {{in the first part}} of the race. The first group was a five-rider breakaway, composed of Lieuwe Westra (...) , Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff), Josef Černý (CCC–Sprandi–Polkowice), Jonas Rickaert (...) and Simon Pellaud (...) [...] Their lead extended to eleven minutes at one point, but was quickly reduced when the pace of the main peloton increased. This broke the peloton into echelons. By the halfway stage, there was a chasing group 90 seconds behind that contained many of the race favourites, including Boonen, Boasson Hagen, Cancellara, Sagan, Tiesj Benoot and Jens Debusschere (both Lotto–Soudal), and Van Avermaet. They were chased by another group that was led by Trek–Segafredo and LottoNL–Jumbo; this group was around a minute further behind. With [...] remaining, the first chasing group caught the breakaway; [...] later, this group was in turn caught by the other chasing group. There was therefore a 50-rider group at the head of the race.|$|E
500|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered, [...] night had fallen and a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by, the Guardian struck an underwater projection <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash.</b> Caught in a sudden gust of wind, the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash.</b> For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
