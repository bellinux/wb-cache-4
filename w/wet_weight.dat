5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E

Addition of wortmannin, which inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport (8. 8 +/- 0. 5 mumol per ml per h vs. 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 mumol per ml per h) and GLUT 4 translocation [2. 79 +/- 0. 20 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> vs. 0. 49 +/- 0. 05 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> ]. In contrast, even at a high concentration (1 microM), wortmannin {{had no effect on}} contraction-mediated glucose uptake (4. 4 +/- 0. 1 mumol per ml per h vs. 4. 1 +/- 0. 2 mumol per ml per h) and GLUT 4 cell surface content [1. 75 +/- 0. 16 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> vs. 1. 52 +/- 0. 16 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> ]. Contraction-mediated translocation of the GLUT 4 transporters to the cell surface was closely correlated with the glucose transport activity and could account fully for the increment in glucose uptake after contraction. The combined effects of contraction and maximal insulin stimulation were greater than either stimulation alone on glucose transport activity (11. 5 +/- 0. 4 mumol per ml per h vs. 5. 6 +/- 0. 2 mumol per ml per h and 9. 0 +/- 0. 2 mumol per ml per h) and on GLUT 4 translocation [4. 10 +/- 0. 20 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> vs. 1. 75 +/- 0. 25 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> and 3. 15 +/- 0. 18 pmol/g (<b>wet</b> muscle <b>weight)</b> ].

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were to determine the level of oxidative stress in atrophied gastrocnemius, and to verify the effect of molecular hydrogen (H 2) saturated alkaline electrolyzed water (HSW) on gastrocnemius atrophy by modifying the redox status, indicated by 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) -like activity. Female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) the control (CONT); (2) the Hindlimb unloading (HU, for 3 weeks) given purified normal water (HU-NW); (3) the HU given alkaline electrolyzed reduced water (HU-AEW); and (4) the HU given HSW (HU-HSW). We showed that 8 -OHdG, but not MDA, significantly increased by 149 % and 145 % in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, when compared with CONT. In contrast, there was a trend toward suppression in 8 -OHdG levels (increased by 95 % compared with CONT) by treatment of HSW, though this effect was not prominent. Additionally, SOD-like activity significantly increased in both HU-NW (184 %) and HU-AEW (199 %) when compared with CONT. This result suggests the elevation of O 2 ˙ in the atrophied gastrocnemius. However, upregulation of SOD-like activity in the HU-HSW was increased by only 169 % compared with CONT, though this difference {{is too small to}} detect statistical significance. HU led to 13 % and 15 % reduction of gastrocnemius <b>wet</b> <b>weights</b> in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, compared with CONT. And the reduction of gastrocnemius <b>wet</b> <b>weights</b> in HU-HSW was attenuated by 7 % compared with CONT. The gastrocnemius <b>wet</b> <b>weights</b> in the HU-HSW group were significantly greater than those in the HU-AEW, but not statistically significant with HU-NW. These results indicate that HU causes an increase in oxidative stress, but, in this experimental protocol, continuous consumption of HSW during HU does not demonstrate successful attenuation of oxidative stress and HU-mediated gastrocnemius atrophy. ...|$|R
