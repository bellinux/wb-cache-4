5|$|In Europe, the <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the passenger pigeon in North America was at least partly due to shooting for use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, <b>wood</b> <b>pigeon</b> flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{prevalence}} and potential subclinical effects of infestation by Trichomonas gallinae in 91 hunter-harvested Common <b>Wood</b> <b>Pigeons</b> Columba palumbus from northern (n = 30) and southern (n = 61) Spain {{during the winter}} period. All animals were measured, sexed, aged, necropsied and their organs were weighed. Infestation with T. gallinae was diagnosed using three different methods: direct inspection {{for the presence of}} lesions, direct microscopic observation and culture. Of the sampled birds, 34. 2 % were positive for the presence of T. gallinae. Prevalence was significantly higher in adult <b>Wood</b> <b>Pigeons</b> than in the juvenile group, and prevalence was significantly lower in birds sampled from the north. No significant differences in prevalence were found between males and females. Culture was significantly more sensitive than the other methods of diagnosis. Parasitized birds were in poorer body condition, as revealed by their lower body mass and fat reserves. No significant variation could be detected in heart or spleen weight between parasitized and healthy birds. However, juvenile <b>Wood</b> <b>Pigeons</b> in which T. gallinae was detected had a significantly larger bursa of Fabricius. Variations in the prevalence of T. gallinae in <b>Wood</b> <b>Pigeons</b> could be related to migration as well as increased exposure through shared feed and water where these are artificially provided. We also discuss the potential effect of T. gallinae on body condition and the eventual risk for endangered predators through increased exposure to infected prey. © 2006 The Authors.

40|$|Abstract In {{late summer}} 2010 a {{mosquito}} born flavivirus not previously reported in Europe called Bagaza virus (BAGV) caused high mortality in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus).

Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} intra- and inter-specific {{variations in}} the difference between alert distances and flight distances for birds in forested habitats E. Fernández-Juricic, M. D. Jimenez, and E. Lucas Abstract: Studies of escape from predators have usually focused on fleeing. We studied intra- and inter-specific varia-tions in a previous level of decision-making during predator–prey encounters by determining {{the difference between the}} distance at which a predator is detected and the distance at which the prey flees from the predator (buffer distance). We measured buffer distances of four bird species (ground foragers) living in forested habitats (wooded recreational parks) to approaching humans. Buffer distances increased with group size and temperature, and this was probably related to dilution of the predation risk and a higher risk of heat stress, respectively. Buffer distances decreased with shrub and coniferous cover, probably because of increased visual obstruction, and increased with tree height, probably because of the increased security provided by taller trees. Grass cover increased buffer distances of <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons</b> (Columba palumbus) but decreased those of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and magpies (Pica pica); this may be related to higher food availability, i. e., vegetation in grassy areas for <b>wood</b> <b>pigeons</b> and food left by humans in area...|$|R
