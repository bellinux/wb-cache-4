50|$|The Euclid Crane and Hoist Co, {{owned by}} George A. Armington and his 5 sons, was a large, {{respected}} and profitable operation, when they introduced the Euclid Automatic Rotary Scraper in 1924 - soon {{followed by the}} Euclid Wheeler (<b>wheeled)</b> <b>scraper.</b> These earthmoving products were conceived by George's eldest son, Arthur, who envisioned a good future in designing earthmoving equipment, and steered the company into the earthmoving field. The two models of scrapers were successful, and a third model, the Euclid Contractors Special, designed to cope with hard ground, was even more successful.|$|R

50|$|George Beckwith {{was born}} in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, the second child of Orville and Louisa Beckwith. His grandfather, Warren Beckwith (b. 1833) was a captain in the Union army during the Civil War and later {{supervised}} the construction of railways in eastern Iowa. He then founded a company producing horse-drawn road-grading equipment of his own design, used {{in the construction of}} railways. Initially established in Mt Pleasant, Western <b>Wheeled</b> <b>Scraper</b> Works soon moved to Aurora, Illinois and years later became part of Austin-Western Works. The family was comfortably wealthy. George Beckwith's cousins Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith and Mary Lincoln Beckwith, children of Orville's brother Warren and Jessie Harlan Lincoln, were the last surviving descendants of Abraham Lincoln.|$|R

50|$|Aurora is on {{the edge}} of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. The city has a long {{tradition}} of manufacturing as does much of Chicago metropolitan area. Prominent manufacturers, past and present include Lyon Workspace Products, The Aurora Silverplate Manufacturing Company, Barber-Greene Company, the Chicago Corset Company, the Aurora Brewing Company, Stephens-Adamson Company, Caterpillar Inc., Allsteel Metals, National Metalwares, and Western <b>Wheeled</b> <b>Scraper</b> Works (later Austin-Western Inc.). The most prominent employer and industry was the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad (later Burlington Northern) which was headquartered in Aurora. The CB&Q Roundhouse is still standing, and is now the popular restaurant originally called Walter Payton's Roundhouse; after the Payton estate ended its involvement in 2009 it became known as America's Historic Roundhouse, and after a 2011 change in ownership, it is now known as Two Brothers Roundhouse.|$|R

In 1986 Caterpillar bought the rights to this concept and thus the [...] DD9G was created (D stands for Dual D9G). Peterson also built the first SxS D9G which has two D9Gs side-by-side, pushing a 24 ft wide bulldozer blade.|$|R

500|$|The Saskatchewan Highway Act was {{established}} in 1922, {{in compliance with the}} 1919 Canadian highway act. At the initial stages of the Saskatchewan Highway Act, [...] of highway were gravel and the rest were earth roads. The road allowances were laid out {{as a part of the}} Dominion Land survey system for homesteading. [...] In 1929, the R.M. of Wood Creek #281 conducted roadwork with three graders, 53 slush <b>scrapers,</b> 15 <b>wheel</b> <b>scrapers</b> and five ploughs. [...] Development of highways began in the 1920s and was virtually halted in the depression years of the 1930s. Early homesteaders, such as John Abrey, would do road maintenance work themselves in this era. In the 1930s seeing a car was rare, Alexander Black remembers taking 150 bushels on a grain tank with a four horse hitch. When they reached highway 2, the horses bolted through town until they snagged on the railway switch by the elevators. Travel along the Provincial Highway 5 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and rail lines. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first highway was designed on 90-degree, right-angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads.|$|R
30|$|The {{clearance}} matching of chainless haulage {{system with}} a pitch of 147  mm was studied. First of all, the variable range of meshing central distance of the shearer walk <b>wheel</b> and <b>scraper</b> conveyor pin rail was determined. Its determination principles are: under the correct meshing situation, the minimum meshing central distance can warrant the no interference and no gear jam between walk wheel and pin rail (two section pin row connection), and it is usually approximately 10  mm less than the pitch radius of the walk wheel; the maximum meshing central distance must satisfy the rational meshing, the simulation shows that the increase of the meshing central distance has little effect, based on analysis and experience, the value is taken as 15  mm larger than the corresponding pitch radius of the walk wheel; a further increase of meshing central distance would cause: imprecise rolling, impact on gears from every contact and alteration, the wear of wheel gear and rack gear, etc.|$|R

50|$|The Haulpak line {{of mining}} and quarry trucks was the best-performing sector for Wabco {{for the entire}} time they owned it and {{eventually}} the <b>scrapers,</b> <b>wheel</b> dozers, graders and front end loaders would be discontinued from the Wabco catalogue. In 1968 Wabco had become part of American Standard Company (known for bathroom fittings) {{and then it would}} become part of Dresser Industries in 1984. After a Komatsu Limited-Dresser joint venture (KDC) in 1988 was formed, the Haulpak truck line was again (partly) under new ownership, although by 1994 Komatsu had purchased all remaining shares of KDC, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Haulpak name was quietly discontinued around 1998 - 1999 and the new trucks were then known as Komatsu machines.|$|R
