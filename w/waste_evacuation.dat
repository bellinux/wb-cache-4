40|$|An {{important}} {{number of}} technological equipment and high-skilled workers {{over long periods}} of time have to be mobilized during nuclear decommissioning processes. The related operations generate complex flows of waste and high inventory levels, associated to information flows of heterogeneous types. Taking into account that more than 10 decommissioning operations are on-going in France and about 50 are expected toward 2025 : A big challenge is addressed today. The management of decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear installations represents an important part of the nuclear-based energy lifecycle, since it has an environmental impact as well as an important influence on the electricity cost and therefore the price for end-users. Bringing new technologies and new solutions into decommissioning methodologies is thus mandatory to improve the quality, cost and delay efficiency of these operations. The purpose of our project is to improve decommissioning management efficiency by developing a decision-support framework dedicated to plan nuclear facility decommissioning operations and to optimize <b>waste</b> <b>evacuation</b> by means of a logistic approach. The target is to create an easy-to-handle tool capable of i) predicting waste flows and proposing the best decommissioning logistics scenario and ii) managing information during all the steps of the process and following the progress: planning, resources, delays, authorizations, saturation zones, waste volume, etc. In this article we present our results from waste nuclear flows simulation during decommissioning process, including discrete-event simulation supported by FLEXSIM 3 -D software. This approach was successfully tested and our works confirms its ability to improve this type of industrial process by identifying the critical points of the chain and optimizing it by identifying improvement actions. This type of simulation, executed before the start of the process operations on the basis of a first conception, allow ‘what-if’ process evaluation and help to ensure quality of the process in an uncertain context. The simulation of nuclear waste flows before evacuation from the site will help reducing the cost and duration of the decommissioning process by optimizing the planning and the use of resources, transitional storage and expensive radioactive waste containers. Additional benefits are expected for the governance system of the <b>waste</b> <b>evacuation</b> since it will enable a shared responsibility of the waste flows...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current solid waste management practices in Jimeta town and provides a brief discussion on the future challenges. Jimeta is the administrative headquarter of the Adamawa state. The population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along axial route linking major cities in the northeast region. Data for this study were obtained from the Adamawa State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA) and relevant literature. Records show that waste are neither sorted nor recycled but dumped in an open dumpsite 3 km away from the city. The performance of agency regarding <b>waste</b> <b>evacuation</b> from source of generation to final disposal point has improved but not been impressive from 2004 to date. Results shows that the agency performed below average as large tonnage of solid waste can be seen at designated dumpsites thereby blocking drainage channels and access road. Thus, 11, 747 tons of solid waste was collected over the period of 4 years from 2004 - 2008. However, this figure increased to 16, 151 tons in 2009 - 2013. This achievement was as a result of change in the leadership of the management team and better funding from the government. It is advocated that solid waste management should not be left in the hands of government agency alone. The public and related stakeholders should actively participate in the management of solid waste so as to have a functional environment for working, living and playing. Keywords...|$|E

So, about 88 percent of the used waters are evacuated in the Dniester river basin (table 2). Also, {{a big part of the}} toxic substances evacuated together with the waste waters in the tributaries Răut, Bâc and Botna, reach the basin of this river. About 99 % of the waters evacuated in the Dniester river basin (except of the tributaries Răut, Bâc and Botna basins) come from the enterprises of Transnistria and Tighina town that are not controlled by the Republic of Moldova authoritie...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{greenhouse}} gases at landfill {{is a great}} point of concern. This research aims to control methane and carbon dioxide by applying novel intelligent MSW management system. The intelligent MSW management system (Intelligent QEJ Bricks) proposed in this research provides new ideas about: landfill operation, material for biogas collection, biogas transport modeling, biogas mass transfer optimization, design configuration, and automatic control system. The operation of new system includes series of cells built subsequently with porous bricks that confines waste cells. This approach implies integrated operation system that combines <b>waste</b> disposal, biogas <b>evacuation,</b> and biogas control. Bricks {{are made up of}} hydrophobic recyclable material that might be available on waste disposal site. In this research, a recyclable hydrophobic polymer (Styrofoam) was tested at laboratory to check its functionality for biogas collection. The test procedure on polymer medium entails the following findings: the permeability, the conductivity and diffusion coefficients, the convective flowrate, and the diffusive flux through polymer medium for carbon dioxide and methane. The influence of parameters such as water content, porosity, temperature variation, pressure gradient, and concentration gradient on gas movement (diffusion and convection) was also analyzed. Information obtained from the laboratory tests were formulated as knowledge bases. The fuzzy logic implicated knowledge bases and specific rules to have the output that represents the gas transport rates in hydrophobic polymer medium {{for a wide range of}} various environmental parameters. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize a transfer function that represents solutions for transfer rates for different ratios of biogas mixture. The mass and volume of biogas within the landfill time of service are determined for designing hydrophobic porous bricks for any ratio of CH 4 :CO 2 in landfill. After having the cells finished and closed the configuration of the new system satisfies confining the waste with hydrophobic porous walls that surrounds the waste and captures all available biogas generated at the landfill. The design includes a system of valves evacuating biogas from porous walls of the bricks. The process of evacuation might link the valves with a blower that is connected with a storage tank or an energy generator. The valves are controlled by fuzzy logic system that is fed by sensors-data acquisition system. The output of automatic intelligent fuzzy system is dependent on the input data from the sensor-data acquisition system...|$|R
