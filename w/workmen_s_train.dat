Of the two daytime trains running between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi, the <b>S</b> <b>trains</b> were faster. Between Helsinki and Leppävaara, S {{services}} stopped at Pasila and Huopalahti. Between Leppävaara and Kauklahti, it stops at every station. Between Kauklahti and Kirkkonummi, it stops only at Masala. From 28 May 1972 to 25 May 1974, the <b>S</b> <b>trains</b> were running between Helsinki and Kauniainen. The route was continued to Kirkkonummi on 27 September 1987. The <b>S</b> <b>trains</b> discontinued in March 2016 when two U-line-only stops {{were closed and}} the U line now runs twice an hour.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} how a {{manufacturing}} company trains their employees in 5 S and to identify the effect of 5 <b>S</b> <b>training</b> for employees. Qualitative approach and single-case study are chosen in this study. The information was collected through interview from Infineon Technologies (Kulim) Sdn. Bhd. The researcher had done an in-depth interviewed with production engineers and worker in the company. In Infineon Technologies, 5 <b>S</b> <b>training</b> conducted by lecture, in-house training and practical training test certification. The impacts of 5 <b>S</b> <b>training</b> {{can be divided into}} two elements: employees and organization. Employees will get benefits from 5 <b>S</b> <b>training</b> such as employee’s attitude changed into positive, value of cleaning, improved employee’s satisfaction, and less wastage and scrap at the workplace. Meanwhile, the organization will get benefits from 5 <b>S</b> <b>training</b> such as employees helped removed or eliminated unnecessary equipment or materials, employees will know systematizing of organization, ease in work flow, zero defects, zero waste, zero incidences or accidents, zero un-scheduled breakdowns, zero delays and zero complaints. This study was limited to the employees from the production department. Hence, the researcher expects to expand the sample size in future research...|$|R

40|$|Postsession {{strychnine}} injections {{have been}} shown to retard acquisition rates of the classically conditioned nictitating membrane response (CCNMR) of rabbits trained at a CS-US interval of 1000 msec. The particular interval value employed in CCNMR acquisition was found to be important in the magnitude of the postsession strychnine effect. Strychnine <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> at a CS-US interval= 1250 msec (nonoptimal) were significantly depressed in acquisition rates relative to saline controls, while strychnine <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> at a CS-US interval= 250 msec (optimal) were not.

40|$|Generalization {{gradients}} along a line-tilt continuum {{were obtained}} from groups of pigeons that had been trained to peck a key on different schedules of reinforcement. In Exp. I, gradients following training on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedule proved to be much flatter than gradients following the usual 1 -min variable interval (VI) training. In Exp. II, {{the value of the}} VI schedule itself was parametrically studied; <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> on long VI schedules (e. g., 4 -min) produced much flatter gradients than <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> on short VI schedules (30 -sec; 1 -min). The results were interpreted mainly in terms of the relative control exerted by internal, proprioceptive cues on the different reinforcement schedules. Several implications of the results for other problems in the field of stimulus generalization are discussed...|$|R
