2500|$|Poland was {{not alone}} in its new-found {{opportunities}} and troubles. With the collapse of Russian and German occupying authorities, virtually all of Poland's newly independent neighbors began fighting over borders: Romania fought <b>with</b> Hungary <b>over</b> Transylvania, Yugoslavia <b>with</b> Italy <b>over</b> Rijeka, Poland <b>with</b> Czechoslovakia <b>over</b> Cieszyn Silesia, <b>with</b> Germany <b>over</b> Poznań and <b>with</b> Ukrainians <b>over</b> Eastern Galicia.

Spreading Communist influences resulted in Communist revolutions in Munich (April–May 1919), in Berlin (January 1919), in Budapest (March–August 1919) and in Prešov in Slovakia (June–July 1919).

We show that, for tree automata <b>with</b> costs <b>over</b> finitely factorizing and naturally ordered semirings, cost- finiteness and boundedness are equivalent. Hence it is also decidable whether a tree automaton <b>with</b> costs <b>over</b> a finitely factorizing, monotonic, and naturally ordered semiring is bounded with respect to the natural order. With this we generalize the results of (Seidl, 1994) concerning the decidability of the boundedness of tree automata <b>with</b> costs <b>over</b> the classical semiring of natural numbers and the (max; +) -semiring of natural numbers...|$|R
