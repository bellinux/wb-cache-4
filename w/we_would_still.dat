500|$|The five doctors {{examined}} Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis {{testified that}} Terri Schiavo {{was in a}} persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified {{that she was in}} a minimally conscious state. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri [...] "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites. Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. This ruling was later affirmed by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, which stated that [...] "this court has closely examined all of the evidence in the record," [...] and [...] "we have... carefully observed the video tapes in their entirety." [...] The court concluded that [...] "...if we were called upon to review the guardianship court's decision de novo, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> affirm it." [...] This decision by the Second District Court of Appeals {{came to be known as}} Schiavo IV in later rulings.|$|E

[...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually wanted to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E

500|$|Similarly to the club's {{successful}} campaign {{the season}} before, but in complete {{contrast to his}} first tenure at the club, the 2010–11 season saw five players joining the club, while roughly five players left the club in the close season. The club started the season inconsistently, with Westley stating the season would be a [...] "massive learning curve" [...] for both himself and the players. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, Stevenage found themselves in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. However, during a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. This included winning six games on the trot, a sequence only matched by Bury. A 3–3 draw against Bury {{on the final day}} of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place. They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals, winning both legs by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. They beat Torquay United 1–0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back-to-back promotions, playing in League One for the first time in the club's history. On securing promotion, Westley said [...] "It's a fantastic feeling. The players work so hard and they deserve everything they get". During the 2010–11 season, Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Reading 2–1. In the previous round, Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3–1 at Broadhall Way. After the match, Westley said before the game he had told the players to [...] "go out and win the match 5–0. We established that if we did just 20% of what it would take to win 5–0 then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> win the game".|$|E

Urrutia attempted to distance the Cuban government (including Castro) from the growing influence of the Communists within the administration, making a series of critical public comments against the latter group. Whilst Castro had not openly declared any affiliation with the Cuban communists, Urrutia had been a declared anti-Communist since they had refused to support the insurrection against Batista, stating in an interview, [...] "If the Cuban people had heeded those words, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have Batista with us ... {{and all those other}} war criminals who are now running away".|$|E

Behavior analysis provides an account of the origins of behavior in terms of the selection of behavior within the lifetime of the individual organism (Skinner, 1981).
