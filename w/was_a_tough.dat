5|$|In the Second Round Vale drew another league {{rival in}} Southport, who battled to a 1–1 draw at Haig Avenue on 12 December, Harry Whitworth's header {{cancelling}} out Basil Hayward's opener. The Vale players later admitted they were fortunate to {{come away with}} a draw, especially seen as Colin Askey and Albert Leake {{spent much of the}} game limping. Two days later Vale recorded a 2–0 win in the replay in what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> game.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} {{with what he}} saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Johnson (November 24, 1929 – June 3, 2011) was a {{gridiron}} football {{running back}} {{known for his}} excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker. His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders. He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers. Commonly referred to as simply John Henry, an allusion to the folk hero of the same name, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> and tenacious player who performed {{at a high level}} well into the tail end of his career.|$|E

5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. Although this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{began his}} 2015 season with wrist pain {{and was not}} sure whether he would play Sydney and the Australian Open. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to play both tournaments. He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury. Del Potro played in Miami and was not seen for nearly a year, undergoing surgery again in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his own terms. His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E

25|$|The grace, strength, {{and safety}} of his marking, {{especially}} at full-back, has seldom been matched; and the consistent beauty, length, and accuracy of his drop kicking was wonderful to behold. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> tenacious, and fearless footballer, able to play through injury and, {{on at least one}} occasion, played with a broken bone in his arm (Hogan, 1996, p.224). Although predominantly a right foot kick, he could kick well with either foot.|$|E
25|$|During {{the week}} in Montpellier, Tsonga re-aggravated his knee problem. He missed the Paris Masters, {{as well as the}} {{important}} French Davis Cup final against Serbia. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> end to the season for Tsonga, as he finished the season outside the top 10 {{for the first time in}} three years, compiled a 31–16 win-loss record (his worst tally since 2007), and failed to reach a single final during the season.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{graduated}} from Dartmouth College in 1848. Like Hungerford, {{he was involved}} in a fraternity, Psi Upsilon (Zeta Chapter). After graduation, he read law for two years with a Buffalo attorney and then formed a partnership, Waters & Patterson, that made tools such as shovels and hoes. Manufacturing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> and grimy business in comparison to banking, where you spent most of the day at a desk counting currency and calculating figures.|$|E

25|$|Season 1996/97 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one {{both on and}} off the field.

Diminishing player numbers also had a {{critical}} effect on finances, and the club were forced to float the idea of merging with South Warrandyte to survive. However this option was voted against, and both clubs continued and prospered in the coming seasons.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Maxtor {{entered the}} mass market with its {{purchase}} of the assets (but not the liabilities) of bankrupt MiniScribe in Longmont, Colorado. The transition <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one as the early products of this union (notably the 7120AT 3.5-inch 120MB drive) had many quality and design problems. Later products managed to sell well despite the initial problems. In 1996, the company completely redesigned its hard drive product line by introducing its DiamondMax series with a Texas Instruments digital signal processor.|$|E
25|$|While the Angevin host placed Wolvesey Castle under siege, Empress Matilda set up her {{headquarters}} in the royal castle and Robert of Gloucester established his command post near Winchester Cathedral (then Saint Swithun's). On August 2, the bishop's men set fire to Winchester, destroying {{a large part of}} the city. Wolvesey <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> nut to crack. It was erected in 1138 and being in the corner of the city walls, could easily contact the outside world. Nevertheless, the Angevins put strong pressure on its defenders.|$|E

25|$|In the playoffs, the North Stars finally {{defeated}} their rival, the Chicago Black Hawks. Minnesota won {{the series}} 3 games to 2, then eliminated the St. Louis Blues in seven games. Only one team remained between the North Stars' second Stanley Cup Final appearance in four seasons: Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> high-scoring series, but Edmonton's star-studded lineup proved {{too much for}} the North Stars, and the Oilers swept Minnesota in four games en route to their first Stanley Cup championship.|$|E
25|$|The team's long July {{road trip}} {{finished}} in Toronto, where Worra started for an injured Hamid. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> lesson for Worra, who was beat for two free kick goals by Sebastian Giovinco in a 4-1 loss. When the team finally returned to RFK, the newly acquired Mullins {{made his first}} start for United and put his new team ahead with a header, but the team surrendered a late tying goal to the visiting Montreal Impact, not long after Montreal's star striker Didier Drogba had been sent off for a dead ball foul. The match also marked the first appearance for United by Kennedy Igboananike, {{who had just been}} acquired in a trade with the Chicago Fire.|$|E
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Second World War in 1939, Collishaw was promoted to Air Commodore and took over as Air Officer Commanding, No. 204 Group ("Egypt Group") in North Africa. He concentrated on strategy and tactics to neutralize the Italian air force and to gain aerial superiority in North Africa. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> challenge considering that his men were flying outdated Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Vickers Wellesley bombers. Soon after the war started Collishaw's men were off the mark quickly, striking at an Italian airbase destroying 18 aircraft within two days of {{the commencement}} of hostilities with only three aircraft losses. He then turned their efforts to bombing harbours, ships and troops {{to hold up the}} reinforcement of North Africa. They sunk the Italian cruiser San Giorgio and blew up an ammo dump.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The {{next year}} {{they had their}} first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett {{accepted}} a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company {{to miss out on}} big winners that had other appealing features. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $ million today) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two years the {{national}} side would sporadically play international fixtures but it would not be until the 1992 Pacific Cup when they would again begin playing with some regularity. At the 1992 Cup competition the side would show significant improvement on their previous inaugural cup effort with victories over Niue, Cook Islands, Fiji and the New Zealand Maori. This run of victories would earn them a place in the final of the 1992 Pacific Cup against the Western Samoan side but they would eventually lose a close fought match by four points 1814. The following tournament two years later would see the Tongan side show further improvement with several comfortable victories again earning them a spot in final of the Pacific Cup this time against the Fijians who had never defeated the Tongans at that time. The final <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> affair but the Mate Ma'a were again victorious over Fiji 3411 and claimed their maiden Pacific Cup title.|$|E
25|$|In October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (who {{had only}} been in power for 12 months since the {{resignation}} of Harold Macmillan) called a general election. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> election, but Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats (a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304). The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems and Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new government {{had to cope with}} a balance of payments deficit and speculative attacks on Sterling. It was the policy of the whole government, and one in which Callaghan concurred, that devaluation should be avoided {{for as long as possible}} and he managed to arrange loans from other central banks and some tax rises to stabilise the economy. Callaghan's time as chancellor was to be during a time of crisis; with high inflation, high unemployment and an unstable economy with a deficit in the budget, a deficit in the balance of import and exports and most importantly conflict over the value of the pound.|$|E
