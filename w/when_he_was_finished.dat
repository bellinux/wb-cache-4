2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment.

After he finished interrogating Engelbart, van Dam agreed the NLS demo was the greatest thing he ever witnessed. Van Dam would go on to become a leader in teaching computer graphics in the 1970s.|$|E
60|$|He was to thresh that day, {{said the}} squire; the other twelve men were already busy at it. There were twelve threshing-floors, and the twelve men {{were at work}} on six of them--two on each. Hans must thresh by himself all that was lying upon the other six floors. He {{went out to the}} barn and got hold of a flail. Then he looked to see how the others did it and did the same, but at hte first stroke he smashed the flail in pieces. There were several flails hanging there, and Hans took the one after the other, but they all went the same way, every one flying in {{splinters}} at the first stroke. He then looked round for something else to work with, and found a pair of strong beams lying near. Next he caught sight of a horse-hide nailed up on the barn-door. With the beams he made a flail, using the skin to tie them together. The one beam he used as a handle, and the other to strike with, and now that was all right. But the barn was too low, there was no room to swing the flail, and the floors were too small. Hans, however, found a remedy for this--he simply lifted the whole roof off the barn, and set it down in the field beside. He then emptied down all the corn that he could lay his hands on and threshed away. He went through one lot after another, and it was ll the same to him what he got hold of, so before midday he had threshed all the squire's grain, his rye and wheat and barley and oats, all mixed through each other. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with this, he lifted the roof up on the barn again, like setting a lid on a box, and went in and told the squire that the job was done.|$|E
