On June 29, 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their Accutane brand in the United States due to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with {{the high cost of}} defending personal-injury lawsuits brought by some patients prescribed the drug. Generic isotretinoin will remain available in the United States through various manufacturers.

Columbia/CBS were eventually mollified with the granting of tape distribution rights in North America, and record and tape distribution in the rest of the world. Another stumbling block was Capitol's insistence that they receive monetary compensation, thought to be around $400,000, for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> perceived to be vast production and distribution costs for the boxed three-record set.

The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower had been elected in 1952.
