40|$|Industrial {{vehicles}} with undercarriage with elastomeric tracks are frequently used in agriculture and forestry, which {{is connected with}} moving on deformable ground. A friction method of transmitting the drive between a drive pulley and a track, which is often applied, is sensitive to adverse ambient conditions, whereas {{the influence of the}} ground on friction feedback conditions {{in the area of the}} ground working on the drive system is significant. Deformable ground may be a source of contamination, which considerably reduces a friction coefficient on <b>wrap</b> of a <b>drive</b> pulley. The article includes the analysis of deformable ground influence on the volume of driving moment transmitted between a drive pulley and elastomeric track. It has been demonstrated that the influence of deformable ground, as a result of additional pressures working on <b>wrap</b> of a <b>drive</b> pulley may, in some circumstances, considerably increase the moment transmitted by means of friction feedback of a drive pulley with elastomeric track. Increase of driving moment may be higher than 50 %.

This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal <b>wrapping</b> process <b>driven</b> by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology. These concepts provide new capabilities for implantable and surgical devices. Strategies for bio-integrated electronics must overcomechallenges associated with the mismatch between the hard,planar surfaces of semiconductor wafers and the soft, curvi-linear tissues of biological systems. These differences in mechanics and form lead, almost invariably, to low-fidelity coupling at th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of winding drive system’s technological requirements of multi-wire cutting system and the characteristics of torque motor, the article proposes a scheme of wrap wheel with torque motor control to overcome the deficiency of the general control motor <b>driven</b> <b>wrap</b> wheel. In determination process of winding system parameter, it provides the selective calculation methods and the control strategy of the torque motor. According to processing materials, we get tension values, and then calculate the output torque, and choose a suitable torque motor and determine the control strategy. Then the design process of winding drive system finishes. Adopting the torque motor as wrap wheel control motor can make wrap device to meet the system requirements. Meanwhile it can simplify the structure of wrap device, and make the cutting-process runs smoothly...|$|R

She sent him off to get his horse at the hotel, and ran up to her room to put on her <b>wraps</b> for the <b>drive.</b> Her mother cleared away the dinner things; she pushed the table {{to the side of}} the room, and then sat down in her feather-cushioned chair and waited her husband's {{pleasure}} to speak. He ordinarily rose from the Sunday dinner and went back to his office; to-day he had taken a chair before the stove. But he had mechanically put his hat on, and he wore it pushed off his forehead as he tilted his chair back on its hind legs, and braced himself against the hearth of the stove with his feet.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn spring clutch. [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>driven</b> shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever. When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|R
2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>drive</b> sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).|$|R
40|$|Space debris {{mitigation}} and remediation are {{urgent and}} growing {{issues to be}} faced for future space operations and space exploitation durability, especially in Low Earth Orbits (LEO). In past decades, several launches have placed more than 6000 satellites into orbit, of which less than a thousand are still operational today. Active Debris Removal (ADR) topic focuses on trading-off, designing and making operational mechanisms placed on board an active chaser that can rendezvous with and grapple an inert and tumbling target, to eventually change its dynamics either directly transferring it to a graveyard orbit or providing a control device to {{be attached to the}} dead element to make it controlled up to disposal. The paper presents the design of a net-based debris capturing payload, to be embarked on a enhanced AVUM based chaser, specifically adapted for large satellites removal from LEO. he study run under ESA support, in collaboration with ELV SpA and MDA Inc. In particular, the numerical simulator, developed at Politecnico di Milano to model the net dynamics from its launch to its target <b>wrapping,</b> useful to <b>drive</b> the design of the flexible components in the payload, is discussed in details: the viscoelastic behaviour of the flexible parts is modelled and a multi-body constrained dynamics has been implemented; the dynamic simulator was already validated by mean of some preliminary experimental campaign, run at Politecnico di Milano as internal research. The results obtained by exploiting the mentioned simulator to make the whole net payload matching the AVUM enhanced I/F requirements are discussed to assess limitations and advantages in exploiting such a high thrust unit for ADR missions...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{international}} break, Arsenal resumed their Premier League campaign {{with a hard}} fought 2-1 home victory over Southampton. Despite an unfortunate own goal by Petr Čech, the Gunners responded with two unanswered goals to ensure the win. In the first half, Laurent Koscielny equalised through a bicycle kick whilst Santi Cazorla struck a penalty in the dying minutes of the match to lead Arsenal to victory. Furthermore, the match saw the debuts of Shkodran Mustafi and Lucas Pérez, with the former making the most clearances and interceptions in the match. Arsenal would begin its 19th consecutive season in the UEFA Champions League three days later with a 1-1 away draw against Paris Saint-Germain. Despite going behind after 42 seconds following an Edinson Cavani header, Arsenal bounced back in the latter stages of the game, with Alexis Sánchez rifling in Arsenal's first shot on target. Olivier Giroud, who was brought on as a substitute, picked up two yellow cards in his 27 minutes, thus causing him to miss the home match against Basel on 28 September. Arsenal would then travel to newly promoted Hull City on 17 September. The Gunners took the lead through Sánchez, who deflected in Alex Iwobi's shot. Sánchez had a penalty saved before half time after a handball by Jake Livermore, who received a red card as a result. In the second half, Arsenal went 2-0 up through a Theo Walcott chip before Hull got a goal back, with Robert Snodgrass converting his penalty when Čech took down Dieumerci Mbokani. Sánchez got his second goal of the game with four minutes later, to restore the two goal lead. Substitute Granit Xhaka scored his first goal in the last minute of stoppage time, with his 25-yard <b>drive</b> <b>wrapping</b> up a 4-1 win.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{with radio}} telescopes address key {{problems}} in cosmology, astrobiology, heliophysics, and planetary science {{including the first}} light in the Universe (Cosmic Dawn), magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the lunar ionosphere. The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>driven</b> roller. The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} driven roller. Springs preload the passive roller against the driven roller, and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to drive the antenna roller. This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user to automatically deploy the thin-film antenna at a rate proportional to the wheel speed as it drives the rover along its trajectory. The software allows Axel to deposit the film onto the ground to prevent or minimize relative motion between the film and the terrain to avoid the risk of scraping and antenna with the terrain...|$|R
