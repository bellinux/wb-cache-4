5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death it was {{probably}} bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian military leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> in 1602.|$|E
5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E

50|$|The {{definition}} of boundedness can be weakened a bit; E <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> if {{and only if}} every countable subset of it <b>is</b> <b>bounded.</b> Also, E <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> {{if and only if}} for every balanced neighborhood V of 0, there exists t such that E ⊂ tV.

5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried {{to enforce the}} law {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

50|$|In circulation, 97.0 to 99.5% of {{testosterone}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to plasma proteins, with 0.5 to 3.0% unbound. It <b>is</b> tightly <b>bound</b> to SHBG and weakly to albumin. Of circulating testosterone, 30 to 44% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to SHBG while 54 to 68% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to albumin. Testosterone that is unbound {{is referred to}} as free testosterone and testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to albumin <b>is</b> referred to as bioavailable testosterone. Unlike testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to SHBG, bioavailable testosterone <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to plasma proteins weakly enough such that, similarly to free testosterone, it may be biologically active, at least to some extent. When referenced collectively (i.e., free, bioavailable, and SHBG-bound), circulating testosterone {{is referred to as}} total testosterone.|$|R
5|$|John Neville's {{marriage}} {{caused a}} dispute with Queen Margaret: even though Isabel was over fourteen years-old (and therefore of legal age), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her ward. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a fine for his marriage to Isabel: he <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> to pay her £1,000 in ten instalments.|$|E

50|$|Dimensional analogy {{also helps}} in {{inferring}} basic properties {{of objects in}} higher dimensions. For example, two-dimensional objects <b>are</b> <b>bounded</b> by one-dimensional boundaries: a square <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by four edges. Three-dimensional objects <b>are</b> <b>bounded</b> by two-dimensional surfaces: a cube <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by 6 square faces. By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer that a four-dimensional cube, known as a tesseract, <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by three-dimensional volumes. And indeed, this is the case: mathematics shows that the tesseract <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by 8 cubes. Knowing this is key to understanding how to interpret a three-dimensional projection of the tesseract. The boundaries of the tesseract project to volumes in the image, not merely two-dimensional surfaces.|$|R
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he {{authorized}} the decision upholding {{the conviction of}} leaders of the Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals <b>was</b> <b>bound.</b> Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of Yates v.

5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} a {{concession}} on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This would allow the airline to connect the route to the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The proposal would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the concession for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the concession application, stating that Norway <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> to grant the concession to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E
