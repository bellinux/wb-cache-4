Sterne is by turns respectful and satirical of Locke's theories, using the association of ideas to construct characters' [...] "hobby-horses", or whimsical obsessions, that both order and disorder their lives in different ways. Sterne borrows from and argues against Locke's language theories (on the imprecision and arbitrariness of <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>usage),</b> and consequently spends much time discussing the very words he uses in his own narrative—with [...] "digressions, gestures, piling up of apparent trivia {{in the effort to}} get at the truth".|$|E
50|$|But {{recently}} {{in the last two}} decades a substantial amount of Kokborok literature has been in the Roman (Latin) Script. In 2004 a statewide movement called Movement for Kokborok was launched by various organisations and societies in Tripura, prominently by Kokborok tei Hukumu Mission and Twipra Students Federation demanding the inclusion of Kokborok at the University level and its adoption as an Official language of India (which had been accorded to its sister language Bodo recently). The case for Roman Script has been widened by the fact that the largest dictionary in the language has been published by KOHM in it from 1995 onwards and got a bigger second edition in 2003. The Dictionary has become a somewhat official reference of the Tripuri people for Kokborok <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>usage.</b>|$|E

The Web Corpus {{is applied to the}} task of automatic thesaurus extraction, obtaining similar overall results to using the Gigaword. The quality of synonyms extracted for each target word is dependent on the word’s usage in the corpus.

40|$|In {{practice}} of manual translation, most {{problems can be}} reduced to the <b>word</b> choice problem <b>and</b> to the problem of understanding of an unknown foreign word. We show how the lexical richness of Internet can be used to semi-automatically solve these problems. Namely, Internet search engines provide useful statistics on word <b>usage</b> frequencies, <b>word</b> combinability, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> <b>usage</b> context. However, the use of this statistics is not straightforward and requires some precautions, which we discuss in the paper. For the same reason, purely automatic application of these techniques seems still impractical, though we show that useful tools for their semi-automatic application can be developed...|$|R
50|$|The {{search engine}} also makes {{possible}} {{new forms of}} research, known as “text mining” and “data mining.” Google’s “ngrams” research tool draws on the Google Library Project corpus to furnish statistical information to Internet users about the frequency of <b>word</b> <b>and</b> phrase <b>usage</b> over centuries. This tool permits users to discern fluctuations of interest in a particular subject over time and space by showing increases and decreases {{in the frequency of}} reference <b>and</b> <b>usage</b> in different periods and different linguistic regions. It also allows researchers to comb over the tens of millions of books Google has scanned in order to examine “word frequencies, syntactic patterns, and thematic markers” and to derive information on how nomenclature, linguistic <b>usage,</b> <b>and</b> literary style have changed over time.|$|R
40|$|Grammatical error {{correction}} (GEC) systems strive to correct both global errors in <b>word</b> order <b>and</b> <b>usage,</b> <b>and</b> local errors in spelling and inflection. Further developing upon recent work on neural machine translation, we propose a new hybrid neural model with nested attention layers for GEC. Experiments {{show that the}} new model can effectively correct errors of both types by incorporating <b>word</b> <b>and</b> character-level information,and that the model significantly outperforms previous neural models for GEC as measured on the standard CoNLL- 14 benchmark dataset. Further analysis also shows that {{the superiority of the}} proposed model can be largely attributed {{to the use of the}} nested attention mechanism, which has proven particularly effective in correcting local errors that involve small edits in orthography...|$|R

Being based on a large catchphrase encyclopedia, the proposed system evaluates each catchphrase’s candidates considering the <b>words,</b> structure <b>and</b> <b>usage</b> of onomatopoeia. That is, candidates are selected whether they contain onomatopoeia and they use specific catchphrase grammatical struc-tures. Subjective experiments show that inserted onomatopoeia is effective for making attractive catchphrases...|$|R

Perhaps the most important act of Benedict XIV's pontificate was the promulgation of his famous laws about missions in the two bulls, Ex quo singulari and Omnium solicitudinum. In these bulls he ruled on the custom of accommodating non-Christian <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>usages</b> to express Christian ideas and practices of the native cultures, which had been extensively done by the Jesuits in their Indian and Chinese missions. An {{example of this is}} the statues of ancestors - there had long been uncertainty whether honour paid to one's ancestors was unacceptable 'ancestor worship,' or if it was something more like the Catholic veneration of the saints. This question was especially pressing {{in the case of an}} ancestor known not to have been a Christian. The choice of a Chinese translation for the name of God had also been debated since the early 17th century. Benedict XIV denounced these practices in these two bulls. The consequence of this was that many of these converts left the Church.|$|R
