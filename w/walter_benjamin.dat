25|$|At {{the same}} time that Eliot was affirming Baudelaire's {{importance}} from a broadly conservative and explicitly Christian viewpoint, left-wing critics such as Wilson and <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> were able to do so from a dramatically different perspective. Benjamin translated Baudelaire's Tableaux Parisiens into German and published a major essay on translation as the foreword.|$|E
25|$|From 1937 to 1939, Mayer was {{a member}} of the Collège de Sociologie, founded by Georges Bataille, Michel Leiris and Roger Caillois in 1937. There he held a lecture about the secret {{political}} societies in German Romanticism and demonstrated how these secret societies already anticipated Nazi symbolism. Other exiles at the Collège were <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> and Paul L. Landsberg.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, Agamben opposes Foucaults {{concept of}} [...] "biopolitics" [...] to right (law), as he defines {{the state of}} exception, in Homo sacer, as the {{inclusion}} of life by right under the figure of ex-ception, which is simultaneously inclusion and exclusion. Following <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamins</b> lead, he explains that our task would be to radically differentiate [...] "pure violence" [...] from right, instead of tying them together, as did Carl Schmitt.|$|R

25|$|Dairy Queens were {{a fixture}} {{of social life}} in small towns of the Midwestern and Southern United States during the 1950s and 1960s.

25|$|Hans Mayer, {{along with}} <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin,</b> {{who was also}} {{with him at the}} Collège de Sociologie, and some others, belongs to the most {{important}} literary critics of the 20th century. Perhaps there is some correlation to a former competitive situation, which Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote about in an obituary, which shows Mayer's life in an unflattering light. Reich-Ranicki describes the story of Hans Mayer's life as a tragic story, as the story of a person who did not find a home anywhere.|$|E

Despite these valid points, Foster admits that the collaboration between artists and communities have often resulted in illuminating results, such as recovering suppressed histories.|$|R

25|$|The {{popularity}} of the new aesthetic led to traditionalist architects adopting Constructivism, as in Ivan Zholtovsky's 1926 MOGES power station or Alexey Shchusev's Narkomzem offices, both in Moscow. Similarly, the engineer Vladimir Shukhov's Shukhov Tower was often seen as an avant-garde work and was, according to <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> in his Moscow Diary, 'unlike any similar structure in the West'. Shukhov also collaborated with Melnikov on the Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage and Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Garage. Many of these buildings are shown in Sergei Eisenstein's film The General Line, which also featured a specially built mock-up Constructivist collective farm designed by Andrey Burov.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a leading}} member of the Frankfurt School of {{critical}} theory, whose work {{has come to be}} associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin,</b> Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.|$|E
25|$|Haywood's {{military}} career included service in three wars. His interest in military combat began when his friends recalled tales of their {{service in the}} Eighth Illinois, Black National Guard Regiment. During World War I, he served with the Eighth Regiment, a black United States regiment. In the Spanish Civil War, like many Americans there, he fought for the Popular Front with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the International Brigades. Haywood held the position of Regimental Commissar in the XV International Brigade during the Battle of Brunete. While in Spain he, Langston Hughes and <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> Garland broadcast from Madrid {{in support of the}} Republican cause.

25|$|Hughes's poetry was {{frequently}} {{published in the}} CPUSA newspaper and {{he was involved in}} initiatives supported by Communist organizations, such as the drive to free the Scottsboro Boys. Partly as a show of support for the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War, in 1937 Hughes traveled to Spain as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American and other various African-American newspapers. In August 1937 he broadcast live from Madrid alongside Harry Haywood and <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> Garland. Hughes was also involved in other Communist-led organizations such as the John Reed Clubs and the League of Struggle for Negro Rights. He was more of a sympathizer than an active participant. He signed a 1938 statement supporting Joseph Stalin's purges and joined the American Peace Mobilization in 1940 working to keep the U.S. from participating in World War II.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the initial}} {{industrial}} musicians preferred to cite artists or thinkers, rather than musicians, as their inspiration. Simon Reynolds declares that [...] "Being a Throbbing Gristle fan was like enrolling in a university course of cultural extremism." [...] John Cage was an initial inspiration for Throbbing Gristle. SPK appreciated Jean Dubuffet, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Baudrillard, Michel Foucault, <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin,</b> Marshall McLuhan, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Gilles Deleuze. Cabaret Voltaire took conceptual cues from Burroughs, J. G. Ballard, and Tristan Tzara. Whitehouse and Nurse with Wound dedicated some of their work to the Marquis de Sade; the latter also took impetus from the Comte de Lautréamont.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Benoît Peeters {{thought that}} The Broken Ear was {{a return to}} [...] "pure adventure" [...] from the [...] "quasi-documentary realism" [...] of The Blue Lotus, and that in this Adventure, {{politics}} remains [...] "in the second line", and that instead Hergé let [...] "the narrative rip and succeeds marvellously." [...] Elsewhere, he praised the work as having a [...] "formidable dynamism" [...] and an [...] "unequaled vitality", containing a [...] "revolution" [...] in narrative structure. He thought that it served as a [...] "perfect metaphor" [...] for the theories of German philosopher <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> published in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936), which Hergé had not read.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{vision of}} {{a society in which}} class, money and {{personal}} ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: [...] "I have learned more [...] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin</b> and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said 1984: [...] "I’m sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [...] the way that country and its society works." [...] In 1970 Roland Barthes published S/Z, a detailed analysis of Balzac's story Sarrasine and a key work in structuralist literary criticism.|$|E

500|$|For Simmel, culture {{referred}} to [...] "the cultivation of individuals through {{the agency of}} external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern (rather than primitive or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamin,</b> {{and other members of the}} Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between [...] "producers" [...] and [...] "consumers" [...] evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The [...] "cultural turn" [...] of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.|$|E

5000|$|This {{changed with}} the October 1929 {{publication}} of his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz which earned him national and global fame. One {{of the best known}} appraisals of the novel is <b>Walter</b> <b>Benjamins</b> essay, [...] "Die Krisis des Romans" [...] ("The Crisis of the Novel") which sees in Berlin Alexanderplatzs radical use of montage a solution to the impasses of the traditional novel. Döblin soon began transforming Berlin Alexanderplatz into a radio play and agreed to cowrite the screenplay for the film version that premiered on 8 October 1931. The early 1930s marked the high point of Döblins fame. During this time he busied himself with lectures, readings, and the effort to contribute to a collective intellectual response to the growing power of the National Socialists. Just over a month after Hitlers ascension to power, Döblin left Germany, crossing into Switzerland on 2 March 1933.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper focuses {{upon the}} {{transformative}} role {{of art and}} the methodological approach of working with artists to conduct ethnographic research with refugees and asylum seekers. In exploring the space or hyphen between ethnography (sociology) and arts based practice (photos, installations, textual practice) I suggest that the combination of biography/narrative (ethnography) and art (mimesis) becomes a "potential space " for transformative possibilities. More specifically, draw-ing upon <b>Walter</b> <b>BENJAMIN's</b> (1992) The Storyteller I will discuss the methodological contribution of combining biography/narrative with art forms (ethno-mimesis) in creating a "potential space", a reflective/safe space for dialogue and narratives to emerge around the themes of transnational identities, home and belonging. The importance of renewing methodologies for the work we do within the area of forced migration, humiliation, "egalization " and human rights (LINDNER, 2006), the role of the arts in processes of social inclusion, and the vital importance for creating spaces fo...|$|R
