Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates.|$|E

5|$|Van der Byl {{took over}} {{at a time when}} South Africa was putting {{increasing}} pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule.

Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> of poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court {{rather than in the}} royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.|$|E

5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’.

5|$|The Renaissance {{began in}} times of {{religious}} turmoil. The late Middle Ages {{was a period of}} political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> variously of simony, nepotism and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to bother him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> of cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>accused</b> by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
