Both he and the other agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off, but Dillinger was determined to shoot it out.|$|E
25|$|Somerset {{exploited}} Essex' declarations {{to take a}} five-wicket win despite rain dominating at Colchester, Somerset's fourth win of the season. After {{the first}} day was over, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but good contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up - William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 - gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They powered on to 400 before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster made 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth made 76 not out before the close of day three to set Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out. André Nel removed Michael Wood for a duck again, but Arul Suppiah added a quick 29, and former England Under-19 player Hildreth settled in well. He made his second unbeaten score of the match, this time worth 125, guiding Somerset past the winning target in 66.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Danish Kaneria bowled 24 of Essex' 66 overs, but to little effect, ending with one wicket for 80 runs, while Nel got William Durston for a duck to end with four wickets for the match - all ducks.|$|E
25|$|Somerset {{exploited}} Essex' declarations to {{take their}} fourth win of the Championship season despite rain curtailing play by nearly 33% at Colchester. After the first day was over with only three overs bowled and Alastair Cook dismissed for a duck, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but double-digit contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up – William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 – gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They made their way to 400 and the five batting points before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster added 87 to his overnight score to end with 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth scored twelve boundaries for an unbeaten 76 at the close of day three to see Somerset to 112 for 2.

40|$|Freezing was one {{alternative}} way {{to maintain}} {{the quality of the}} fish. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the amount of nutrients lost from frozen fish drip non <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines and <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines on a long pull at different low storage temperatures of 2 - 5 °C. The method used was experimental laboratory with the basic design of completely randomized design (CRD) with factorial pattern and repeated 3 times. Parameters measured were driploss test, the fat, water, protein and provitamin A content in the drip,  SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis and organoleptic test. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that treatment of non <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines and <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines fish freezing and storage time gave a significant effect (P< 0, 05) on driploss; fat, moisture, protein, provitamin A content in the drip;  Morphological image test with SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and organoleptic value. Driploss frozen fish of non <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines damaged 2 times greater than  <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines, Value provitamin in the drip of non <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines frozen fish in the begunning of storage that was  185. 28 ± 9. 85 µg/ 100 g and in the endof  storage was 257. 23 ± 17. 00 µg/ 100 g and organoleptic value of non <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines was 7. 91 ± 0. 90 and <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> spines 7. 53 ± 1. 06 in the end of storage...|$|R
2500|$|The {{freshman}} then [...] "pops to" [...] {{attention and}} [...] "sounds off", loudly greeting the upperclassman with [...] "Howdy, Ms. Smith, Ma'am!" [...] From that point on, the freshman {{is expected to}} remember the name, hometown, and major of the upperclassman at any future meeting, {{and is expected to}} greet him or her appropriately. If the fish does not recall an upperclassman's name, he or she must <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> again. Freshmen must also observe a complex set of rules governing when and where <b>whipping</b> <b>out</b> to and greeting upperclassmen is appropriate. For example, fish in the band must <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> to other bandsmen anywhere on campus, but they need not <b>whip</b> <b>out</b> to non-band cadets unless they are on the Quad.|$|R

He learned to play with his brothers, playing with a [...] "gum-wood bat and a piece of banksia root chiselled down to make a ball." [...] He learned to bowl because his older brothers dominated the batting rights. His bowling action was far from the classic leg spin bowler's run-up and delivery, indeed, according to Wisden, [...] "he was asked to make up the numbers in a Sydney junior match and, with a method that at first made everyone giggle, <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> the opposition". From a young age, O'Reilly was a tall and gangly player.|$|E

500|$|Another {{well-documented}} gunfight {{resulted in}} the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way. Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being [...] "in a fever of excitement at the time." [...] Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws' bullets tore at Davis's clothing, but caused only two slight flesh wounds. Within moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying {{on the ground and}} Davis's pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> his Bowie knife, and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke {{was last}} seen {{at the head of}} the bridge, where he {{received}} a sabre wound from a Carlist officer on one of his legs and fell from his horse. Clarke, with his left arm still in a sling from a wound received at Oriamendi, became prisoner and was executed the following day at Tolosa. One of Clarke's subordinates, Captain Larkham, was shot and killed by a sharpshooter while involved in a sword duel with a Carlist officer. After the action on the bridge, the Scotchs and two Rifles companies were cut off from the village's center. One of the Rifles companies keeping watch on the Carlist main breastwork, commanded by Captain Courtenay and two subalterns, was almost <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> by the Spanish rebels, with only five survivors. The British stragglers fled in disarray, only to be killed by the rebels or died from exhaustion. The remains of Clarke's column, meanwhile, [...] sought shelter in the local church. The thick walls of the building provided a good protection against gunfire, and in its stores were plenty of food and supplies, but the 25 soldiers eventually surrendered to the Carlists on 16 September, on the promise of mercy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, {{at the age}} of 26, Leonard Keith Lawson {{took five}} June Dally-Watkins {{photographic}} models into the Terrey Hills bush in north Sydney and, at gunpoint, raped two and sexually assaulted the others. He was condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted to 14 years' jail and he was released after serving only half the term. [...] On 7 November 1962, while painting a portrait of 16-year-old Manly girl, Jane Bower, in his flat at Collaroy, Lawson bound her arms, sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death. The next day, he burst into the chapel of the Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School at Moss Vale, taking schoolgirls hostage. [...] In the siege, a struggle ensued and his gun discharged, killing 15-year-old Wendy Sue Luscombe, who was sitting in the pews. Lawson was sentenced to life imprisonment. [...] On 15 December 1972, a group of dancers arrived at Parramatta jail to give a concert for the inmates. Lawson, on privileges, was in the audience. At the end of the performance, he <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> a knife and jumped to the stage, holding the blade to the throat of dancer Sharon Hamilton in what prison warders believe was an escape attempt.|$|E
2500|$|Wyatt Earp recounted {{one event}} during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock were in Fort Griffin, Texas, {{during the winter}} of 1878, looking for {{gambling}} opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange. The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday’s death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the San Francisco Enquirer. According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey [...] "monkeying with the dead wood" [...] or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to [...] "play poker", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday <b>whipped</b> <b>out</b> a knife from his breast pocket and [...] "caught Bailey just below the brisket" [...] or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.|$|E

Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth.
