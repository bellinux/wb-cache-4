2500|$|In 2000, McCartney {{said the}} initial {{idea for the}} song began with Bobby Rydell's hit [...] "Forget Him" [...] with its call and {{response}} pattern, and that [...] "as often happens, you think of one song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea {{but at least we}} then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it—John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars." [...] It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hotel room one day and wrote the song. I {{talked to him about}} what I was trying to say and one thing led to another. We came back and recorded a vocal." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{travelled}} to Gera, where Dr. Christoph Schwabe met me [ [...] . ] It was a cold, windy day, and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} <b>the</b> fireplace and talked {{for over two}} hours about his way toward music therapy, the development of music therapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German Democratic Republic (GDR), different influences and experiences within that field before 1989 and {{the changes that have}} taken place since then...|$|R
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> silently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sealed {{house and}} Abu-Shaker {{reported}} what was happening[...] [...]The rioters had arrived. We heard them growling cries of murder [...] [...]We also heard the voiced of Abu-Shaker:'Get out of here! You won't enter here! You won't enter here!." [...] They pushed him. He was old, maybe 75 years old, {{but he had}} a strong [...] body. He struggled. He lay <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> entrance to the home, by the door, and cried out. [...] "Only over my dead body will you pass through here! Over my corpse!" [...] One rioter wielded his knife over Abu-Shaker and yelled. 'I will kill you, traitor|!" [...] The knife struck him. Abu-Shaker's leg was cut. His blood was spilt. He did not emit any groans of pain. He did not shout, he only said.'Go and cut! I am not moving!" [...] The rioters consulted with each other: {{there was a moment of}} silence. Later we heard them leaving. We knew we had been saved. We wanted to bring our savior inside and bandage his wound and thank him. He refused and said that others might arrived and that his task has not ended yet." ...|$|R
40|$|Friday, July 27, 2007 9 : 09 a. m. Ivan {{forgot about}} our first, scheduled, {{interview}} which I {{had set up}} while at break-fast with Dave at Jerry’s. I really doubt I ever would have gotten {{to talk to the}} guy if I didn’t have that <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> beginning. We were just sitting there drinking coffee and Dave said, “That’s the guy you should be interviewing” and waved Ivan over. When I called to confirm our meeting Ivan said that he had corporate stuff that day (Thursday) but could do the interview Friday morning before my departure to Paisley. That sounded fine and at 9 the next morning <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> booth closest to the door. Ivan had seemed like a reserved guy before and I was sort of dreading another dental surgery interview like a few of the guys here have given me. Maybe it was the 5 or six cups of coffee we both drank but he got to be very lively and our topics of conversation flowed from fishing to the restaurant, Vietnam and to Lakeview in general. He was comfortable speaking and good at doing so. My only regret is the noise level on the recording. It made transcription difficult and, I’m sure, accuracy suffered...|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins] Tuesday 10 / 10 / 44 Dearest darling— Although I’ve {{had only}} 5 hrs. sleep, I’m none the worst for {{it this morning}} (6 : 45 a. m.). However, since it has rained for 2 {{continuous}} days (this may make the third) I can honestly say the weather gets me down more than the hours I keep. The nursery school (Emanual) has turned out almost the way I expected. There {{is a little too}} much routine 2 ̆ 6 discipline—it does go against “my grain;” but it is a convenient place to work (relatively easy to get to 2 ̆ 6 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart of a shopping district) 2 ̆ 6 Mrs. Bennett, head teacher, seems to want to cooperate with hrs. 2 ̆ 6 stuff. Mrs. B. is quite a remarkable woman since she has a husband who has long sieges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital 2 ̆ 6 is slowing [sic] fading away 2 ̆ 6 she manages him, plus a home, plus a job 2 ̆ 6 plus 3 kids, ages 16, 13 2 ̆ 6 10. I definitely admire her. They have several good volunteers at the Center among which there is a refuge Fr. woman married to an Am. man. Interesting—huh? I haven’t gotten to really talk to her as yet. However, all the pd. help is part time except Bennett 2 ̆ 6 myself, which puts me 2 nd in command. There is: Mrs. Cox, very old, who has no patiences [sic] 2 ̆ 6 makes me sick. She has no reason to work except her own morale. Mrs. Kubak, who is middle-aged, 2 ̆ 6 quite good. Miss Haas—(counsin [sic] to Jean Haas—OSU— 1938 — 42) who goes to Reserve part-time—she only works 4 hrs. per day. We have about 35 children 2 ̆ 6 several colored kids. Mrs. Cox is definitely prejudiced which maybe another reason why I dislike her. Riding a Rapid 2 ̆ 6 writing is no joy—but I love you enough to attempt it. Mort had a marvelous time in Columbus—and how! However, he is no longer interested in Eunice Perelman, but is interested in an old g. f. —“Pookie” Weinstein, A. E. Phi. By the way, Arline Bellin just got married to her Lt. (j. g.) Nat Pritcher. Met Mort 2 ̆ 6 Uk in town last night 2 ̆ 6 I took them out to the Hickory Grill for dinner. Then, we shopped 2 ̆ 6 Uk bought a dress. At 9 we went to hear the Don Cossack Chorus. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> about <b>the</b> middle of the last balcony. Just as the program commenced a man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last row of the last balcony either fainted or had a heart attack. It “kind of” ruined the program—but I doubt if anything could ruin the program. I hate a Chorus, but this one is not a Chorus—it is a full orchestra. They produce every sound found in an orchestra—Mort, Uk 2 ̆ 6 I both thought it amazing. They, also, had 2 marvelous Russian dancers who were extremely lumber 2 ̆ 6 did beautifully <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rosataka 2 ̆ 6 other dances. Honey, I’m finishing this at work, so must get one. I love you madly, as usual. Ever yours— Edith P. S. The human organism is funny—huh?—I’m thinking of what happened to “that man” last night. Wilkie’s death is, also, a great loss—he could have been a great man [...] 2 ̆ 6 his ideas would have been sound enough to win him the post war election—anyhow, my vote. [Transcription ends...|$|R
