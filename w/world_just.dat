40|$|Belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world</b> {{hypothesis}} {{is defined as}} the belief that the <b>world</b> is a <b>just</b> place where people generally get what they deserve. It states that individuals have a need to believe that they live in a just world; they believe in a world where people get what they deserve and where people deserve what they get. Individuals believe that who work hard or who perform good acts obtain rewards for their actions, while the sinners and the laggards receive punishments instead. Similarly, individuals want to believe that positive outcomes, whether money, success, or happiness, are obtained only by good people and, conversely, that negative outcomes only happen to bad persons. Justice beliefs have been hypothesized as adaptive for dealing with day-to-day stres. <b>Just</b> <b>world</b> beliefs protect individuals from the daily negative psychological consequences of living in what is realistically an unjust <b>world.</b> In addition, <b>just</b> <b>world</b> beliefs are thought to enhance feelings of security to the extent that if the individual satisfies the conditions for being "good," he or she is protected from injustice. The belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world,</b> like other positive illusions, should contribute to the maintenance of one's mental health. Belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world's</b> is discussed in two ways: personal belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world's</b> answers the question “how much justly is the world to me?”, whereas the belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world's</b> in general answers the question “how much justly is the world?...|$|R

5000|$|To {{explain these}} studies' findings, Lerner theorized {{that there was}} a {{prevalent}} belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world.</b> A <b>just</b> <b>world</b> is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world</b> as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a <b>just</b> <b>world</b> functions as a sort of [...] "contract" [...] with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior.
