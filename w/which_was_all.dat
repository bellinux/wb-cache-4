5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 1649, the {{negotiations}} with the Cossacks fell through, and the Polish-Lithuanian military begun gathering near the borders with the rebellious Ukraine, a major camp was in Zbarazh, where Wiśniowiecki would arrive as well in late June, after gathering a new army of 3,000 in Wiśnicz, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> he was able to afford at that time, as due to most of his estates being overrun by the Cossacks. Wiśniowiecki's arrival raised the morale of the royal army, and despite having no official rank, both the common soldiers and the new regimentarz promised to take his advice, and even offered him the official command (which he refused). During the Siege of Zbarazh Wiśniowiecki was thus not the official commander (role was taken by regimentarz Andrzej Firlej) but most historians agree he was the real, if unofficial, commander of the Polish-Lithuanian army. The siege would last until the ceasefire of the Treaty of Zboriv. Wiśniowiecki's command during the siege was seen as phenomenal, and his popularity among the troops and nobility rose again, however the King, still not fond of him, gave him a relatively small reward (the land grant of starostwo przasnyskie, much less when compared to several others he distributed around that time). Needing Wiśniowiecki's support in December that year, the King granted him once again a temporary hetman nomination, and several more land grants. In April 1650, Wiśniowiecki had to return his temporary hetman office to Mikołaj Potocki, recently released from Cossack's captivity. During December that year, in light of the growing tensions with Muscovy, Wiśniowiecki's military faction succeeded in convincing the Sejm to pass a resolution increasing the size of the army to 51,000, the largest army since the Cossack unrest begun two years ago.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{had begun}} {{planning}} a counterattack during the Australian advance on Finschhafen. The {{main part of}} the 20th Division was moved down from Madang as the Japanese began concentrating their forces around Sattelberg, with the main force arriving there on 11 October. The Japanese plans became known to the Australians through captured documents and by mid-October 1943 the Australian 24th Infantry Brigade had been brought up to reinforce the 20th. When the Japanese counterattack came, signalled by a bonfire on Sattelberg, the first wave fell upon the 24th Brigade around Jivevaneng on 16 October but the attack, having been put in a piecemeal fashion, was pushed back. The next day Japanese aircraft attacked Allied forces around Scarlet Beach and this was followed shortly an amphibious landing <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> but destroyed at sea by fire from American and Australian anti-aircraft and machine-guns. It was during this assault that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the actions for which he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Only a small number of Japanese managed to make it ashore amidst the devastating fire and, by the following day, these all had been killed or wounded by Australian infantry conducting mopping up operations.|$|E

Six poles and 10 race wins (including three of the first four), took him to his first GP title, {{by a margin of}} 125 points (equivalent to five victories) over Dani Pedrosa, which he built {{during the second half of}} the season. His worst finish was a 6th place at Motegi, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> he needed to clinch the title that day, taking the first premier class title for an Italian or a non-Japanese {{manufacturer}} since Phil Read's title for MV Agusta in 1974.

25|$|Throughout {{these early}} stages of development, much of the {{understanding}} of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily LASNEX. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the Shiva laser project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to electrons rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.|$|E

25|$|Back home to {{play the}} Houston Astros on May 25, Kershaw allowed a 2-run homer to J. D. Martinez {{in the third inning}} and were unable to {{overcome}} it in a 3–1 defeat. The following day, L.A. again managed to avoid losing three in a row as A. J. Ellis hit a three-run walk-off homer in a 6–3 victory. The Dodgers beat the Astros on May 27, 5–1 behind Chris Capuano who allowed only two hits in seven innings. Jerry Hairston, Jr. had 5 hits in 5 at-bats and backup catcher Matt Treanor homered in the win. The Dodgers bats were silent on Memorial Day as they only scored two runs against Milwaukee Brewers starter Shaun Marcum and lost 3–2. Nathan Eovaldi made his first start for the Dodgers (replacing the injured Ted Lilly) on May 29 and promptly allowed a two-run homer by Ryan Braun {{in the top of the}} 1st, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the Brewers needed to defeat the Dodgers 2–1. The Dodgers lost their third straight game (for the first time in the 2012 season) when they fell to the Brewers 6–3 the next day. In only his second day back after spending 15 days on the disabled list, Matt Kemp re-injured his left hamstring while scoring in the 1st inning. After receiving the news that Kemp would likely be out for all of June, the Dodgers meekly lost to the Brewers 6–2 to end the homestand. The series marked the first time the Dodgers were swept in a four-game series at home since 1993 and the first time they were ever swept by the Brewers in any series.|$|E
25|$|Back on the road, the Dodgers {{were shut}} out by Oakland Athletics starter Brandon McCarthy and Aaron Harang struggled, walking 8 batters in only 4 innings and {{allowing}} 3 {{runs in the}} 1st <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> Oakland needed in the 3–0 victory. The Dodger offense continued to stumble the following day, losing again to Oakland, this time by a score of 4–1. Clayton Kershaw allowed only one run on three hits in eight innings in the finale but the Athletics still swept the Dodgers thanks to a walk-off home run by Yoenis Céspedes off Josh Lindblom {{in the bottom of}} the ninth that gave them a 4–1 win. The Dodgers traveled to Anaheim to begin another series with the Angels on June 22. They took an early 5–0 lead, partially thanks to a 3-run homer hit by Bobby Abreu, but lost the game 8-5 to extend their losing streak to four games. The Dodgers ended their skid and picked up a win the next day as Chris Capuano allowed only one run in 7 innings to pick up his ninth win and Dee Gordon was 2-4 with a triple, a stolen base and 2 runs scored in the Dodgers 3–1 win over the Angels. The Dodgers dropped the finale of the Freeway Series when they lost 5–3. This continued the Angels streak of beating the Dodgers in interleague series that has continued since 2006. The Dodgers next traveled to San Francisco for a divisional series against the second place Giants. However, rookie Nathan Eovaldi struggled, allowing 7 runs in the first 2 innings and 8 total in his 5 innings of work and the Dodgers lost 8–0 to see their lead over the Giants in the division drop to 2 games. Clayton Kershaw allowed only 2 runs against the Giants the next day, but the team was again shut down offensively (this time by Ryan Vogelsong) as they lost 2–0. This was the first time the Dodgers had been shut out in back-to-back games against the Giants since 1987. The Dodgers woes continued the next day as they were shut out 3-0 by Tim Lincecum and the Giants. The Dodgers, who were shut out in 3 straight games in the series and fell into a tie with the Giants for first place in the division, extended their scoreless streak to 30 innings. This was the first time one team had thrown three straight shutouts against the Dodgers since the 1937 Boston Braves did it to the Brooklyn Dodgers.|$|E

500|$|The second {{inauguration of}} Ulysses Grant's Presidency {{was held on}} Tuesday, March 4, 1873, commencing the second {{four-year}} term his presidency. {{it was the only}} term of Henry Wilson as Vice President.

[...] The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. President Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began..|$|E
