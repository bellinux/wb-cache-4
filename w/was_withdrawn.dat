Those units surviving in the early 1970s were designated as British Rail Class 405 under the TOPS computer system.|$|R
5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was given the same name; this <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of two Chinooks designated the Rotary Wing Group operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades the helicopters had received proved successful, and {{allowed them to}} operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in September 2006 the helicopters remained {{in the country and}} were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in Urozgan Province. The detachment <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received upgrades, which included new engines and blue force tracker equipment. During subsequent years the detachment <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> to Australia during the Afghan winters, and redeployed each spring. By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 the helicopters had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for and sustaining the Rotary Wing Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.|$|E

5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> to be stripped of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy.

5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
