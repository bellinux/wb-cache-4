25|$|According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic {{said nothing}} upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but {{stood up and}} walked, in order to {{demonstrate}} the falsity of Zeno's conclusions. To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.|$|E

The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you.

25|$|Descending to the basement, he soon {{encounters}} {{the spirits}} of three of Abbot's most famous occupants. Dr. Killjoy (voiced by John Armstrong) was a psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an insane asylum on the island in the 1920s. Obsessed with discovering <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Torque, Killjoy appears as an image projected from 16 mm film projectors. Hermes T. Haight (John Patrick Lowrie) was the executioner in Abbot for twenty-seven years, before he committed suicide in the gas chamber. He appears as a green vapor formed {{into the shape of}} a human. Hermes is determined to drive Torque into unleashing the evil inside him. Horace P. Gauge (John Armstrong) was an inmate who was executed in the electric chair for murdering his wife during a conjugal visit. Full of guilt for his actions, he claims Carnate drove him to it, and wants to help Torque realize his decency. He appears in the form of electricity. They teach Torque how to unleash the anger inside himself and transform into a powerful monster, although the transformation is only in Torque's mind.|$|E

500|$|... "Ugly" [...] is {{the seventh}} {{episode of the}} fourth season of House and the seventy-seventh episode overall. It aired on November 13, 2007. The episode {{revolves}} around a teenager named Kenny Cyrus with a major facial deformity. He is set to get surgery in order to remove the deformity, but has a heart attack {{just prior to the}} surgery. Dr. Gregory House, who still has not hired a new diagnostic team out of six interns, tries to figure out <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Kenny. Kenny was being filmed by a documentary crew during the process of the surgery, so House has to find out <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Kenny while being filmed by the crew.|$|E

[...] Cocks also criticised the actors, saying that Moore [...] "lacks all Connery's strengths and has several deep deficiencies", while Lee was [...] "an unusually unimpressive villain".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{revolves}} around Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) noticing {{a man named}} Jeff (Paul Rae) in the emergency room, whom he thinks is [...] "too nice".

Meanwhile, Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), thinks the other diagnostic team members don't respect him, while Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek) and House try to create a deal in which they can both spend time with Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard).|$|E

A terrible fit of anger was beginning to loose its hold upon him. His breathing was labored in gasps and sobs. Unutterable stupidity of his father--horrible cruelty of his position! What had he ever done in all his life to suffer under such a curse? Yet almost he clung to his wrath, for it had been righteous. That thing, that infernal twist in the brain, that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his father. His father who had been fifty years in the United States!

The two discover that while Mulder's condition has made him unresponsive, it has given him telepathic powers. Scully, working in Africa, witnesses several strange events relating to the wreck before returning to Washington.|$|E
500|$|During Stewart's {{appearance}} on CNN's Crossfire, Stewart criticized that show {{and said that}} it was [...] "hurting America" [...] by sensationalizing debates and enabling political spin. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on The Daily Show, Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a [...] "fake news" [...] comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. [...] "You're on CNN!" [...] Stewart said, [...] "The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls! <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> you?" [...] Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because [...] "you can't interview Bill Clinton, Richard Clarke, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Dole, etc., etc., and still say you're just a comedian." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review in The Sunday Telegraph, historian Noel Malcolm suggested that Dalrymple [...] "is spreading his net too widely, so that 'sentimentality' comes {{to stand for}} any moralising view that does not satisfy his own scrutiny; it's not that these things should not be criticised, merely that sentimentalism {{may not be the}} key to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> them". Malcolm also questioned Dalrymple's views on modern educational theory, writing [...] "these ideas have long and complex histories, in which sentimentalism {{is only part of the}} story. The 'progressive' attack on discipline, and on traditional institutions such as the family, was concerned as much with power-structures and class as it ever was with sentiment or human goodness", and took issue with Dalrymple's assessment of Rousseau. [...] In a short negative review of the book in The Independent on Sunday, which appeared after the book's 2011 paperback release, Brandon Robshaw wrote, [...] "There is some good sense here, but it's vitiated by the pompous, peevish tone, the futile nostalgia for an airbrushed past, unnecessary sideswipes (at John Rawls, for example, or climate science) and by the poor editing". In an ambivalent review on the website MercatorNet, Francis Phillips wrote [...] "The book leaves one with the impression that it is a somewhat hotchpotch compendium of views and articles already well rehearsed by the author—though nonetheless true for all that. What is disheartening is his bleak attitude towards human nature; having diagnosed the disease he is at a loss to suggest a remedy".|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

5000|$|The organisers of {{the online}} {{petition}} criticised the apology as [...] "inadequate", stating that it [...] "dodges the issue of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the original article, fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for how this piece happened, holds nobody to account for its publication and offers no reassurance that this won't happen again".|$|R

2500|$|Woolf {{speaks of}} {{criticism}} as being vague rather than concrete. In her criticism within [...] "Modern Fiction" [...] of H.G.
