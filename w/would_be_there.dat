However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|Aaron Copland wrote Connotations {{to fulfill}} a {{commission}} from Leonard Bernstein for the opening concert of the New York Philharmonic's new home in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Since this hall was slated as {{the first part of}} Lincoln Center for completion, its inauguration was considered especially momentous. Among the guest list of 2600 for the first concert and the white-tie gala which would follow it were John D. Rockefeller III (chairman of Lincoln Center), Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, United Nations Secretary General U Thant and prominent figures in the arts that included of Metropolitan Opera General Manager Rudolf Bing, violinist Isaac Stern and actress Merle Oberon. Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber, Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Richard Rodgers, William Schuman and Roger Sessions. United States President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie had also been invited. Their initial inability to attend caused some consternation, since they had voiced their support for American culture. At the last minute, Jackie Kennedy said she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as they said that 50,000 Copperheads <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> for the event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson {{may have been a}} double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not}} know which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail. He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship {{for the people of}} Houston. On the July 10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not know}} which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to watch.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{military}} has proposed {{building a new}} aircraft carrier berth on Guam and moving 8,600 Marines, and 9,000 of their dependents, to Guam from Okinawa, Japan. Including the required construction workers, this buildup would increase Guam's population by 45%. In a February 2010 letter, the United States Environmental Protection Agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall, sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs. By 2012, these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 Marines stationed on the island, two thirds of whom <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> on a rotational basis without their dependents.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E
25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E

Foster went early in the first session, and {{although}} the final two batsmen Angus Fraser and Nick Cook both absorbed a few overs each to help Smith move onto 143, neither really bothered the scorers, Fraser out for 2, and Cook was 0 not out when Smiths wicket finally fell, caught by Hohns off Merv Hughes. England all out for 260 early on day two.|$|E
25|$|The Allied High Command (SHAEF) {{requested}} the Free French force in {{question to be}} all-white, if possible, but this was very difficult {{because of the large}} numbers of black West Africans in their ranks. General Leclerc sent a small advance party to enter Paris, with the message that the 2e DB (composed of 10,000 French, 3,600 Maghrebis and about 350 Spaniards in the 9th company of the 3rd Battalion of the Régiment de Marche du Tchad made up mainly of Spanish Republican exiles) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> the following day. This party was commanded by Captain Raymond Dronne, and was given the honour to be the first Allied unit to enter Paris ahead of the 2e Division Blindée. The 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers-Marins Commandos formed from the Free French Navy Fusiliers-Marins that had landed on Sword Beach were also amongst the first of the Free French forces to enter Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} the show was created in 2007 by The Coca-Cola Company, when musical {{performances}} were held on a concert-like platform in Brazil. In 2008, the concept was adopted by Vital Signs member Rohail Hyatt, who planned to launch a Pakistani version of the show. The inaugural season premiered in June {{in front of a}} live audience. The show was produced by him, along with his wife Umber Hyatt and band members Shahzad Hasan & Rizwan-ul-Haq. It was an immediate success, receiving critical acclaim and frequently being rebroadcast on numerous television and radio stations in the country. In season 2, live audiences were excluded and performances were held in a closed studio platform, a format which continues to this day. Hyatt remained as executive producers {{for the show}} until season 6, stepping aside in 2013 after five years. They were replaced by Strings members Bilal Maqsood and Faisal Kapadia until on 29 October 2017, Strings announced Season 10 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> last production.|$|E

25|$|In India, Ganesh Savarkar had {{organised}} {{an armed}} {{revolt against the}} Morley-Minto reforms of 1909. The British police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime. Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Madame Cama's home in Paris. He was nevertheless arrested by police on 13 March 1910. In {{the final days of}} freedom, Savarkar wrote letters to a close friend planning his escape. Knowing that he would most likely be shipped to India, Savarkar asked his friend to keep track of which ship and route he would be taken through. When the ship SS Morea reached the port of Marseille on 8 July 1910, Savarkar escaped from his cell through a porthole and dived into the water, swimming to the shore in the hope that his friend <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to receive him in a car. But his friend was late in arriving, and the alarm having been raised, Savarkar was re-arrested.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E
