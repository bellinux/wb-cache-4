5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{believed}} that comets were atmospheric phenomena, {{due to the}} fact that they could appear outside of the Zodiac and vary in brightness over the course of a few days. Pliny the Elder {{believed that}} comets <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> with political unrest and death.|$|E

5|$|Not {{all aspects}} of {{existence}} were seen as deities. Although many deities <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> with the Nile, no god personified {{it in the way}} that Ra personified the sun. Short-lived phenomena, like rainbows or eclipses, were not represented by gods; neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Sewerage & Water Supply {{authority}} {{took over}} control of the pumping station from 1901 until 1910, when both the prison and town <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> to Perth's metropolitan water supply. The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} park center opened in 2001 {{and the park}} was expanded on 23 August 2003.

5|$|The two-story station {{building}} {{was destroyed by}} a fire on June 11, 1983. The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism; the fire was judged to be of suspicious origin. The MBTA did not replace the building, but handicapped-accessible platforms were installed in 1992 and <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> with footbridges.|$|E
50|$|A Klein {{geometry}} (G, H) is geometrically oriented if G <b>is</b> <b>connected.</b> (This {{does not}} imply that G/H is an oriented manifold). If H <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> it follows that G <b>is</b> also <b>connected</b> (this <b>is</b> because G/H is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>connected,</b> and G → G/H is a fibration).|$|R

5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E
5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E

50|$|The {{semantics}} {{of power}} graphs are as follows: if two power nodes <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> by a power edge, {{this means that}} all nodes of the first power node <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> to all nodes of the second power node. Similarly, if a power node <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> to itself by a power edge, this signifies that all nodes in the power node <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> to each other by edges.|$|R

5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> via separate {{leads to}} a motorized switch that selected {{each one of the}} inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C airborne radar design from 1942–43.|$|E
5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
