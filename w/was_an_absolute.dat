5|$|Flanders had {{a strict}} Congregationalist {{religious}} beginning, which evolved with his experience into {{a belief in}} “moral law.” He felt that “recognition of moral law {{is as much a}} necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.” In Flanders’s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that all cultures hold in common. For him it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> standard. He spoke of a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in everything he did.|$|E

From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, along with one of their hosts; they were later driven across the county to stay at Ophir Hall for about six weeks {{in order for a}} cataract operation could be performed by a New York doctor on the king's left eye.

25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. People either loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha was a genius at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record that speaks for itself. Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books far more often had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E
