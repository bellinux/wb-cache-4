5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of}} this body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E

500|$|Upon Alston's death, MLB {{commissioner}} Peter Ueberroth {{referred to}} {{him as one of}} baseball's greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on {{how easy it was to}} play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Longfellow's {{personality}} {{has become}} part of his reputation. He has been presented as a gentle, placid, poetic soul, an image perpetuated by his brother Samuel Longfellow who wrote an early biography which specifically emphasized these points. As James Russell Lowell said, Longfellow had an [...] "absolute sweetness, simplicity, and modesty". At Longfellow's funeral, his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson called him [...] "a sweet and beautiful soul". In reality, his life was much more difficult than was assumed. He suffered from neuralgia, which caused him constant pain, and he also had poor eyesight. He wrote to friend Charles Sumner: [...] "I do not believe anyone can be perfectly well, who has a brain and a heart". He had difficulty coping with the death of his second wife. Longfellow <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> reserved, and private; in later years, he was known for being unsocial and avoided leaving home.|$|E

500|$|In June 1968 he {{returned}} to England, settling in Selsey after resigning his post in Armagh. During the NASA Apollo programme, presenting on the Apollo 8 mission, he said that [...] "this {{is one of the}} great moments of human history", only to have his broadcast interrupted by the children's programme Jackanory. He was a presenter for the Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 missions, and a commenter, with Cliff Michelmore and James Burke, for BBC television's coverage of the Moon landing missions. Moore could not remember his words at the [...] "Eagle has landed" [...] moment, and the BBC has lost the tapes of the broadcast. A homemade recording reveals that the studio team <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> during the landing sequence, leaving the NASA commentary clear of interruptions. Some 14 seconds after [...] "contact" [...] Burke says [...] "They've touched". At 36 seconds he says [...] "Eagle has landed". Between 53 and 62 seconds he explains the upcoming stay/no-stay decision and NASA announces the T1 stay at 90 seconds after contact. At 100 seconds the recorded sequence ends. Thus any real-time comment Moore made was not broadcast live and the recording ends before Burke polls the studio team for comment and reaction. Moore participated in TV coverage of Apollo missions 12 to 17.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the artists}} {{attending}} those meetings was painter John Opper, who {{said in an interview}} that Swinden <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> shy, and inhibited. He also said that Swinden was one of the best painters in the group. [...] "His paintings were very powerful, very strong. You would think he would be one of those robust persons like Gorky, for instance. But he was the opposite of Gorky. He was very withdrawn." [...] Around this time, Swinden may have painted abstracts exclusively. But later, according to Irving Sandler, [...] "it was sort of a mixture between figurative and geometric abstraction. It was a kind of hard-edge figure towards the end." ...|$|E

Anselmo's father, Phil, owned and operated a restaurant in Metairie called Anselmo's, which closed following the wake of Hurricane Katrina due to financial troubles. Anselmo has said in various interviews that he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> and secluded as a child. He spent some time working on fishing boats as a young man. As a teen, Anselmo accidentally started a fire in his parent's house while pulling a prank on his sister.

2500|$|As a child, Archie <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> {{but very}} mischievous - {{especially}} {{when he was with}} his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, “Archie, my smart boy, never give up your smartness; that goes for you and your brother Quentin." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... I thought we were dead. John raised his hands, said he was sorry. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet.</b> My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Los Angeles, Morris Kight (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), Reverend Troy Perry (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) {{gathered}} {{to plan a}} commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, [...] "as ambiguous as we could be." [...] But Rev. Perry recalled the Los Angeles Police Chief Edward M. Davis telling him, “As far as I’m concerned, granting a permit {{to a group of}} homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to a group of thieves and robbers.” Grudgingly, the Police Commission granted the permit, though there were fees exceeding $1.5 million. After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the “constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.” From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike what we see today, the first gay parade <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet.</b> The marchers convened on McCadden Place in Hollywood, marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard. The Advocate reported [...] "Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard." ...|$|E
