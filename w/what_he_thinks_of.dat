25|$|Dalton {{has been}} with the show since season 4 and takes part in the vast {{majority}} of the show's main storylines. He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations. He also takes his fatherhood very seriously, often trying to pass on his ideas and wisdom to other people (most notably Harold). He generally tells people exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> them, even if it means offending them.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy expresses {{her deep}} infatuation with Schroeder and asks him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> {{the idea of}} {{marriage}}. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: [...] "My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician" [...] ("Schroeder"). Sally is sad because her jump rope tangled up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> me, really? He {{must have}} felt {{interested}} in me, else {{he would not have}} sent me my necklace. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> my marriage? What notions has he to make him so grave about things? Why is he come to Diplow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yus, you are,' {{repeated}} Mrs. Blakeston, advancing menacingly, so that Liza shrank back. 'An' wot's more, 'e treats yer like one. I know 'oo give yer thet black eye; thet shows <b>what</b> <b>'e</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> yer! An' serve yer bloomin' well {{right if}} 'e'd give yer one in both eyes!' ...|$|R
50|$|Kramer again gets Jerry into trouble, by {{revealing}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> truly <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Susan Ross's old college roommate Sally Weaver (Kathy Griffin).|$|R
6000|$|MARGARET. [much annoyed] Father: do {{please be}} {{commonly}} civil to a gentleman {{who has been}} of the greatest service to me. <b>What</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> us? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{heard his}} name? Not heard of young Duncan Macmorrogh, {{the first man}} of the day, by far; not heard of him? Go and ask the Marquess of Sheepshead <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> him. Go and ask Lord Two and Two <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> him. Duncan dines with Lord Two and Two every week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's detestable. He's {{conceited}} and presuming {{beyond all}} endurance. I don't care <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> me. But it's his manner towards you that I can't tolerate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, Father John, I can't help <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Thady. As to his {{thinking}} of me, I'm quite satisfied with that, and I suppose that's enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Too old {{to enter}} {{on a new}} field of duties,"' read Mrs. Prendergast, indignantly. 'Why, he is but forty-four! <b>What</b> did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> us for coming here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} are, aunt. <b>What</b> would <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me if, at some future time, he should have to find that I {{had been in his}} way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS SPAULDING: [...] "No matter. There's {{no excuse}} for me. I listened simply because I was a woman, and couldn't help it; and, oh, <b>what</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it exceedingly--if you act from conviction. Then of course only; but {{of one thing}} I'm myself convinced--of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> {{yourself}} and feels for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll call up Mr. Powell and see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> it," [...] {{answered}} Dick. And {{a little}} later he was in communication with Songbird's uncle over the telephone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Charley,' {{returned}} his sister, detaining {{his hand as}} he withdrew it, 'I think you had better stay. I think Mr Headstone had better not say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> saying.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, of you, {{and your}} father, and Mr. John. You have travelled, {{and are more}} than half European; but <b>what</b> can <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> those who have never left America?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes, I need. He doesn't {{know that}} I've been {{laughing}} about him to you; but, don't you see, I laughed {{when we met}} Dick; and <b>what</b> can <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{back and}} tell us {{as soon as you}} can," [...] {{commanded}} Mrs. Joyce. [...] "I'm crazy to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did last night, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He won't tell me. But he {{has found}} it out. You know how you stand in his opinion--I leave you to imagine <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Clara's conduct in coming here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Here {{is another}} opportunity, gentle Reader, for playing a [...] trick on your {{innocent}} friend. Put the proposed Syllogism before [...] him, {{and ask him}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the Conclusion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He cannot!' said Ethel. 'Don't {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> it himself? He said to papa {{last year that}} your father would as soon have sent Leonard to the hulks as to the Vintry Mill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that will}} never do, Harry. Why, <b>what</b> would <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> us if <b>he</b> comes in and finds us sitting down in his parlour just as if the place belonged to us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, I {{promised him}} I would," [...] said she; [...] "and <b>what</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me?--what must <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me, {{to throw him}} off so cruelly, so harshly, after all that's past?--Oh, aunt! I must see him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, <b>what</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me?" [...] ejaculated Margaret; but {{nevertheless}} I fancy {{that there must}} have been some elation in her bosom when she regarded herself and the freckled muslin in the glass.|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{believe in}} these {{innocent}} {{people who do}} not know what they are doing half their time. Ask any London magistrate <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the lady who explains that she picked up the diamond brooch:- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> it?' thought Soames, {{who knew}} well enough {{that this group}} was hopelessly vieux jeu; hopelessly of the last generation. There was no longer any sale at Jobson's for such works of art.|$|E
60|$|MARY. Have I changed? Not even in thought. My father, Walter says, shall {{live and}} die with us. He shall only have gained another son. And you--you know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> you; you know what I would do for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Let it be so. Perhaps {{you will}} go away now and leave me to myself. I have got a bad headache, and I can't talk any more. Oh dear, oh dear, <b>what</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|HOTCHKISS. Polly: I ask you on {{my knees}} to let me make George's {{acquaintance}} in his home this afternoon; and I shall remain {{on my knees}} till the Bishop comes in and sees us. <b>What</b> will <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you then? ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, he {{dismissed}} {{the first class}} to their experiments in practical philosophy, and eyed Nicholas with a look, half cunning and half doubtful, {{as if he were}} not altogether certain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him by this time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who would?' said Elizabeth; 'I {{am afraid}} I cannot tell you <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> your sense, but of this I am sure, {{that he must}} think you the choicest damsel of his acquaintance, and wish his daughters were more like you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow me!" [...] she said, {{sweeping}} round, with an imperious gesture. [...] "You {{shall see}} my son! You shall hear {{from his own}} lips <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> this--intrusion. Perhaps you will leave the Abbey at his bidding, if not at mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Sneer. Pray, Mr. Puff, how came Sir Christopher Hatton {{never to}} ask that {{question}} before? Puff. What before the play began?-how the plague could he? Dang. That's true, i'faith! Puff. But you will hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the matter. Sir Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! {{very nice}} and pretty indeed," [...] replied Mrs. Blyth, rather absently and confusedly. She knew {{as much of}} Madonna's history as her husband did; and was {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the present which young Thorpe proposed giving to their adopted child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} {{a new face}} among us, since you returned?" [...] were his sister-in-law's first words. Randal {{answered}} {{that he had seen}} Miss Westerfield. The inevitable question followed. <b>What</b> did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her? [...] "I'll tell you in a week or two more," [...] he replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} come and see my father," [...] she said. [...] "I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, it is all so strange. Hendrika, take the child to my hut and give her milk, then put her into my bed; I will come presently." ...|$|R
