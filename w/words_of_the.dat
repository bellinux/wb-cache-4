A <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{day is a}} transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the HAVE QUICK system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, time <b>of</b> day and net number are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes.|$|R

5|$|In the {{previous}} year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center {{found out that}} 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the first <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was filmed and {{released}} in 2000. Filmed inside a nightclub, the video begins with Durand entering the stage while simultaneous images of the band using instruments appear. Durand then {{stands in front of}} a microphone, preparing for an upcoming verse. Various shots of an audience, background dancers and singers, and trumpet performers are also shown. After the second chorus, the clip focuses on Durand, who is now mouthing some of the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song; the final chorus resumes the simultaneous images setup.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's {{translation of the}} biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition {{as he had done}} with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E

Gehn is {{stranded}} when Atrus and Catherine {{destroy all}} linking books on Riven, escaping by using a book Ti'ana wrote for them, leading to the Age of Myst. Atrus drops the Myst linking book into a massive disturbance on Riven known as the Star Fissure; the book falls through the fissure {{to be picked up}} by the Stranger in Myst. The closing <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book are the opening narrative from the video game.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis in the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% {{of respondents said they}} liked the anthem.|$|E

5|$|In the Gospel of Luke the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat are {{spoken by}} Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation. It is a chosen {{opportunity}} {{to give more}} than ordinary attention to the Magnificat canticle in liturgy, while the feast celebrates the event tied to its origin.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused. It concluded (in line with previous {{cases such as}} Davis v.

5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, in the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
