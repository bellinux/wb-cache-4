During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu.

On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'.

After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marks the}} return of Nicholas Lea as Alex Krycek. In {{previous}} episodes, Krycek {{was one of the}} series' main antagonists. However, in [...] "Essence", he temporarily switches sides. As such, portraying actor Lea explains the character's motivation: [...] "Toward the end, he realizes that it's possible that the world could completely go down the tubes—then he's got a stake in trying to keep that from happening. That's <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> giving the information to Mulder so that he can use it." ...|$|E
25|$|Donald Keene has {{speculated that}} {{his love of}} music {{affected}} the poetry he was writing in 1922, as this was <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> collecting records of western music, particularly Bach and Beethoven. Much of his poetic tone derives from synesthesia involving music becoming color, especially after the period 1921 and 1926 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> listening to music of Debussy, Wagner and Strauss.|$|R

The lyrics 'Return to power draws near' is because he's waiting to get strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then 'Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears' is everybody's blood flowing into him. So basically, 'Raining Blood' is all the angels' blood falling on him." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{intolerant}} of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning foreign languages. In the episode [...] "My Future Self n' Me" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> [...] "Parental Revenge Corp", he speaks Spanish to his Latino workers, though {{he may have}} learned the language merely from a practical standpoint {{in order to better}} exploit a labor pool. He also knows German, and once spoke a few phrases while dressed up as Adolf Hitler while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German. Cartman can also be seen speaking broken German with an American accent in Season 15 Episode 2 [...] "Funnybot". Conversely in one episode ("Major Boobage") Cartman acts as an Oskar Schindler character for the town's cats, a rare case of a subplot based on Cartman's altruism.|$|E

When East of Eden debuts, Warner is furious that he does not show up at the premiere.

500|$|Mitsuda names his {{favorite}} works as the soundtracks to the Chrono series, Xenogears, Xenosaga Episode I, {{and the original}} album Kirite, though {{he also says that}} all of his soundtracks are [...] "representational works", as they represent who he was as a composer when he made them. His favorite pieces overall are [...] "The Girl Who Closed Her Heart" [...] and [...] "Pain" [...] from Xenosaga Episode I and pieces from Kirite. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> to compose a soundtrack, he first takes one month to gather information and artwork about the game world and scenario, so that his music will fit in with the game. He also finds it easier to be inspired if he has a visual representation. Mitsuda claims that he does not save his best work for more popular games, as he tries to compose each piece to correspond to how {{it is going to be}} used in a specific game. He also tries to compose good pieces even for games he feels do not live up to them, so that they will be a redeeming point about the game for the players. The majority of his video game soundtracks are for role-playing games, but he likes projects that are different from what he has done before and is interested in working in other genres.|$|E
500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E

2500|$|... "Panic" [...] drew {{negative}} reaction from critics who construed Morrissey's lyrics {{to have a}} racist connotation.

[...] Fletcher says that the lack of any explicit indication the song was about radio meant [...] "Panic" [...] "could be construed as reviving the racist and homophobic '' campaign of late 1970s America." [...] Scritti Politti's Green Gartside accused the song and the band of being racist.|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{theatrical}} {{release of}} the film differs slightly from the US release in plot and running time.

She says she has been [...] "waiting for him, everywhere and since forever." [...] When he awakens the next morning, she is gone without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was meant to be an allegorical figure representing death. This scene was removed from the final US version, reducing the film from 105 minutes to 98 minutes. Newman felt that the scene gave the film [...] "an allegorical lift" [...] but the studio was afraid that the audience would not understand.|$|E
