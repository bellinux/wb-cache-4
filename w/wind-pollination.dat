However, [...] "dioecy has proven difficult to explain simply as an outbreeding mechanism in plants that lack self-incompatibility". Resource-allocation constraints may be important {{in the evolution of}} dioecy, for example, with <b>wind-pollination,</b> separate male flowers arranged in a catkin that vibrates in the wind may provide better pollen dispersal. In climbing plants, rapid upward growth may be essential, and resource allocation to fruit production may be incompatible with rapid growth, thus giving an advantage to delayed production of female flowers. Dioecy has evolved separately in many different lineages, and monoecy in the plant lineage correlates with the evolution of dioecy, suggesting that dioecy can evolve more readily from plants that already produce separate male and female flowers.|$|E

This is because Ulmus pumila has <b>wind-pollination</b> as its primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination through insects.

40|$|Abstract: It {{was shown}} {{that most of}} the fertilizations were the result of {{cross-pollination}} by insects and <b>wind-pollination</b> in buckwheat might be below 1. 3 % from the fertilization ratio in buckwheat, although the <b>wind-pollination</b> could become up to 1. 8 % occasionally. It has been believed that the main pollinators in buckwheat are honeybees and flies which are flying insects. But it was demonstrated in this study that the walking insects, for example ants, must not be ignored as the pollinators in buckwheat. This result indicated that the interruption of pollination not only by flying insects but also by walking insects is important in breeding and seed propagation. The sum of the seed-set pollinated only by the flying insects and only by the walking insects exceeded the seed-set pollinated by both insects. So it seemed that buckwheat were pollinated more than the potential seed-set in this experimental site in Nagoya. The walking insects pollinated more actively than the flying insects in the summer cultivation, although the magnitudes of pollination by flying and walking insects were almost the same in the autumn cultivation. Not only the flying insects but also the walking insects should be valued in buckwheat cultivation...|$|E

In this study, the forest refuge theory is examined at the molecular level in Milicia excelsa, a dioecious tree with a continuous range throughout tropical Africa. Eight nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and two sequences and one microsatellite from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) showed a deep divide between samples from Benin and those from Lower Guinea. This suggests that these populations were isolated in separate geographical regions, probably for several glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, and that the nuclear gene pools were not homogenized despite M. excelsa's <b>wind-pollination</b> syndrome.

Similar levels of dioecy (21 %) and patterns of flowering phenology were observed to those reported for rainforests elsewhere.

The showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers of the model species Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) are highly specialized for bee pollination. In A. majus, CYCLOIDEA (CYC), DICHOTOMA (DICH), RADIALIS (RAD), and DIVARICATA (DIV) specify the development of floral bilateral symmetry. However, it is unclear to what extent evolution of these genes has resulted in flower morphological divergence among closely related members of Plantaginaceae differing in pollination syndrome. We compared floral symmetry genes from insect-pollinated Digitalis purpurea, which has bilaterally symmetrical flowers, with those from closely related Aragoa abietina and wind-pollinated Plantago major, {{both of which have}} radially symmetrical flowers. We demonstrate that Plantago, but not Aragoa, species have lost a dorsally expressed CYC-like gene and downstream targets RAD and DIV. Furthermore, the single P. major CYC-like gene is expressed across all regions of the flower, similar to expression of its ortholog in closely related Veronica serpyllifolia. We propose that changes in the expression of duplicated CYC-like genes led to the evolution of radial flower symmetry in Aragoa/Plantago, and that further disintegration of the symmetry gene pathway resulted in the <b>wind-pollination</b> syndrome of Plantago.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has strong genetic and adaptive differentiation despite life history characteristics that promote high levels of gene flow and can homogenize intraspecific differences, such as <b>wind-pollination</b> and self-incompatibility. To better understand how historical and contemporary factors shape variation in switchgrass, we use genotyping-by-sequencing to characterize switchgrass from across its range at 98 042 SNPs. Population structuring reflects biogeographic and ploidy differences within and between switchgrass ecotypes and indicates that biogeographic history, ploidy incompatibilities and differential adaptation each have important roles in shaping ecotypic differentiation in switchgrass. At one extreme, we determine that two Panicum taxa are not separate species but are actually conspecific, ecologically divergent types of switchgrass adapted to the extreme conditions of coastal sand dune habitats. Conversely, we identify natural hybrids among lowland and upland ecotypes and visualize their genome-wide {{patterns of}} admixture. Furthermore, we determine that genetic differentiation between primarily tetraploid and octoploid lineages is not caused solely by ploidy differences.

This suggests that polyploidy in switchgrass is promoted by admixture of diverged lineages, which may be important for maintaining genetic differentiation between switchgrass ecotypes where they are sympatric.

30|$|Despite the {{occurrence}} of successful insect pollination, the pollinator activity is easily influenced by environmental condition, and almost no visiting insect was observed on rainy or cloudy days in this study. In Meigu Dafengding Natural Reserve, the flowering period of T. sinense is just coincident with the rainy season (June to August), which has {{a negative impact on}} the flower-visiting behavior of insects. In addition, the density of airborne pollen grains declined completely 8  m away from the canopy, and the average inter-tree distance is 15 [*]±[*] 6  m due to the decrease of population density, which may {{have a negative effect on}} <b>wind-pollination</b> for this species. Thus, the successful reproduction for T. sinense may only rely on self-pollination or geitonogamy in most cases, which would result in autogamous and geitonogamous selfing. However, selfing would result in inbreeding depression or reduction of genetic diversity, and then decreasing the ability of the population to adapt in response to environmental change (Buza et al. 2000, Gaudeul & Till-Bottraud 2003), which would be unfavorable to natural regeneration of T. sinense. Thereby, the decrease of population density and harsh environmental condition during flowering and pollination might be one of crucial reasons resulting in endanger for this species. The urgent task is to comprehensively analyze the factors resulting in poor ability to regenerate naturally during genetic and developmental process of T. sinense, and to formulate effective protective measures. Especially, it is necessary to enlarge its population and individual number as soon as possible through artificial intervention.|$|E

An understanding of the suitability of extant habitats for pollinating species is crucial for planning management actions to protect and manage these service providers. In a highly modified agricultural ecosystem, we tested the effect of different pollination treatments (open, autonomous self- and <b>wind-pollination)</b> on pod set, seed set, and seed weight in field beans (Vicia faba). We also investigated the effect of semi-natural habitats and flower abundance on pollinators of field beans. Pollinator sampling was undertaken in ten field bean fields along a gradient of habitat complexity; CORINE land cover classification was used to analyse the land use patterns between 500 – 3000 m around the sites. Total yield from open-pollination increased by 185 % compared to autonomous self-pollination. There was positive interactive effect of local flower abundance and cover of semi-natural habitats on overall abundance of pollinators at 1500 and 2000 m, and abundance of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) at 1000 – 2000 m. In contrast, species richness of pollinators was only correlated with flower abundance and not with semi-natural habitats. We did not find a link between pod set from open-pollination and pollinator abundance, possibly due to variations in the growing conditions and pollinator communities between sites. We conclude that insect pollination is essential for optimal bean yields and therefore the maintenance of semi-natural habitats in agriculture-dominated landscapes should ensure stable and more efficient pollination services in field beans...|$|E

Within the core ‘‘higher’ ’ hamamelids three subclades were resolved, Myricaceae, (Casuarina-(Ticodendron-(Betulaceae))), and (Rhoiptelea-Juglandaceae).

Eight nuclear microsatellites (nuSSRs) and two sequences and one microsatellite from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) showed a deep divide between samples from Benin and those from Lower Guinea. This suggests both that these populations were isolated in separate geographical regions, probably for several glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, and a poor mixture of gene pools despite M. excelsa’s <b>wind-pollination</b> syndrome. The divide can also be related to seed dispersal patterns, which should be largely determined by the migration behaviour of M. excelsa's main seed disperser, the frugivorous bat Eidolon helvum. Within Lower Guinea, a north-south divide, observed with both markers despite weak genetic structure (nuSSRs: FST= 0. 035, cpDNA: GST= 0. 506), suggested the existence of separate Pleistocene refugia in Cameroon and the Gabon/Congo region. We inferred a pollen-to-seed dispersal distance ratio of 1. 76, consistent with wide-ranging gene dispersal by both wind and bats. Simulations in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework suggested low nuSSR and cpDNA mutation rates but imprecise estimates of other demographic parameters, probably due to a substantial gene flow between the Lower Guinean gene pools.

Comparative studies of these species with shared life history traits can help identify evolutionary factors that have played most important roles in determining genetic diversity within and between populations in ocean-current dispersed mangrove tree species. We sampled 935 individuals from 54 natural populations for genotyping with 13 microsatellite markers to investigate the level of genetic variation, population structure, and gene flow on a broad geographic scale in Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, and R. stylosa across the IWP region. In contrast to the pattern expected of long-lived woody plants with predominant <b>wind-pollination,</b> water-dispersed seeds and wide geographic range, genetic variation within populations was generally low in all the three species, especially in those peripheral populations from geographic range limits. Although the large water-buoyant propagules of Rhizophora have capacity for long distance dispersal, such events might be rare in reality, as reflected by {{the low level of}} gene flow and high genetic differentiation between most of population pairs within each species. Phylogeographic separation of Australian and Pacific island populations from SE Asian lineages previously revealed with DNA sequence data was still detectable in R. apiculata based on genetic distances, but this pattern of disjunction was not always evident in R. mucronata and R. stylosa, suggesting that fast-evolving molecular markers could be more suitable for detecting contemporary genetic structure but not deep evolutionary divergence caused by historical vicariance. Given that mangrove species generally have small effective population sizes, we conclude that genetic drift coupled with limited gene flow have played a dominant role in producing the current pattern of population genetic diversity in the IWP Rhizophora species, overshadowing the effects of their life history traits. Recent population fragmentation and disturbances arising from human activities could further endanger genetic diversity in mangrove trees...|$|E
40|$|Although Mauritia flexuosa (Arecaceae) plays {{a pivotal}} role in the ecology and economy of the Amazon, and occurs in a variety of habitats, {{little is known about the}} {{influence}} of habitat on the reproductive biology of this palm. My dissertation focuses on the reproductive biology of M. flexuosa in three habitats in Roraima, Brazil: undisturbed forest, undisturbed forest-savanna ecotone, and savanna disturbed by plantations of the exotic tree, Acacia mangium. First, I calculated sex ratios and linked precipitation patterns with phenology. Sex ratios were female-biased. Precipitation was negatively associated with flowering, and positively associated with fruiting. Habitat appears to have no significant influence on phenology of M. flexuosa, although short-term climate variation may affect phenology of this species. Second, I examined floral biology, observed floral visitors, and performed exclusion experiments to determine the pollination system of M. flexuosa. Fruit set did not differ significantly between the visitor exclusion treatment and the control, but was significantly lowest in the wind + visitor exclusion treatment, suggesting that this dioecious palm is anemophilous, independent of habitat. Third, I identified the abiotic and biotic factors explaining variation in fruit mass, seed mass, seed number per fruit, and total fruit yield among habitats. Soil moisture and flooding during the wet season were the best predictors of fruit and seed output. The number of leaves, diameter at breast height, and height were all accurate predictors of reproductive output, but crown volume did not accurately predict fruit yields. Results re-evaluate traditional assumptions about <b>wind-pollination</b> in the tropics, and highlight abiotic and biotic factors responsible for variation in reproductive output of M. flexuosa, with implications for effective management of this palm. Finally, I interviewed harvesters and vendors to document the traditional knowledge and market dynamics of the fruit of M. flexuosa, buriti. Traditional knowledge corroborated results from scientific studies. Vendors argued that the price of buriti must increase, and must fluctuate with varying supply. With appropriate economic incentives to vendors/harvesters, Roraima may expand its market infrastructure for buriti, effectively stimulating the regional economy and practicing sustainable harvesting. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{pollination}} drop (PD) is {{a characteristic}} feature of many wind-pollinated gymnosperms. Although accumulating {{evidence shows that}} the PD plays {{a critical role in}} the pollination process, the mechanism of PD withdrawal is still unclear. Here, we carefully observed the PD withdrawal process and investigated the underlying mechanism of PD withdrawal, which will aid the understanding of <b>wind-pollination</b> efficiency in gymnosperms. Results In Ginkgo biloba, PDs were secreted on the micropyle during the pollination period and persisted for about 240 [*]h when not pollinated under laboratory conditions. The withdrawal of an isolated PD required only 1 [*]h for evaporation, much less than a PD on the living ovule, which required 100 [*]h. When pollinated with viable pollen, PDs withdrew rapidly within 4 [*]h. In contrast, nonviable pollen and acetone-treated pollen did not cause PD withdrawal. Although 100 % relative humidity significantly inhibited PD withdrawal, pollinated PDs still could withdraw completely within 48 [*]h. Pollen grains of Cycas revoluta, which {{are similar to those of}} G. biloba, could induce PD withdrawal more rapidly than those of two distantly related gymnosperms (Pinus thunbergii and Abies firma) or two angiosperms (Paeonia suffruticosa and Orychophragmus violaceus). Furthermore, pollen of G. biloba and C. revoluta submerged immediately when encountering the PD, then sank to the bottom and entered the micropyle. The saccate pollen of P. thunbergii and A. firma submerged into the PD, but remained floating at the top and finally accumulated on the micropyle after PD withdrawal. In contrast, pollen of the angiosperms P. suffruticosa, Salix babylonica, and O. violaceus did not submerge, instead remaining clustered at the edge without entering the PD. Conclusions We conclude that PD withdrawal is primarily determined by the dynamic balance between evaporation and ovule secretion, of which pollen is a critical stimulator. When conspecific pollen grains were submerged in the PD, ovule secretion was subsequently terminated and active absorption occurred. These processes cooperated to influence PD withdrawal. In addition, pollen grain behavior within PDs varied dramatically among taxa, and PDs played a role in distinguishing and transporting pollen in G. biloba. </p...|$|E

Thirty-five new palynomorph species and two genera are described and illustrated. Critical palynomorph types are systematically described, compared to other species, and documented stratigraphically. ^ Middle Triassic conifer pollen and spores recovered from a cored section of the Al Aziziyah Formation are separated into two discrete suites. On the basis of new appearances of diagnostic species, Suite I is assigned to the early Ladinian, and Suite II is assigned to the late Ladinian. ^ Palynological analysis of outcrop material and several boreholes permits the establishment of three palynozones within the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous sediments of western Libya. Palynomorph assemblages of these biozones range in age from the Callovian (Middle Jurassic) to the Berriasian (Early Cretaceous). ^ Spore and pollen assemblages from subsurface Kiklah Formation (Albian) are often associated with dinoflagellates and allow recognition of three distinct assemblage zones. Zone III, which is late Albian in age, is further separated into two subzones on the basis of appearance of characteristic species. ^ Paleogeographic distribution of palynomorphs is analysed to assess the previously proposed dates and boundaries, and to interpret the continental to marginal marine depositional system characteristic of the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sequence in northwestern Libya. The 2 ̆ 2 Nubian Sandstone 2 ̆ 2 facies in the As Sarir region and in the Murzuq Basin, traditionally considered of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, are divided on the basis of pollen and spores into four assemblage zones. Environments of deposition and paleogeography of these facies are interpreted in the light of new findings. Palynomorph assemblages indicate that 2 ̆ 2 Nubian Sandstone 2 ̆ 2 in western Libya was deposited by braided streams, flowing from the southern highlands. ^ Application of local biostratigraphy for species-level comparisons with coeval microfloras from other parts of Northern Gondwana, particularly North Africa, Gabon Basin, and Brazil, confirms extension of the West African-South American (WASA) Province into North Africa. Sparse Laurasian palynomorphs may indicate that the West African-South American/Boreal floral boundary crossed into North Africa. ^ Developed regional correlations and palynostratigraphy are used to test hypotheses on paleogeography, place and time of origin, and adaptive radiation of the early angiosperms. The new data are used to improve knowledge on the first appearance of specific microfloras and the geographic and geologic conditions of the African craton during the Mesozoic. Palynostratigraphic data support the concept that initial angiosperm evolution took place in semiarid environment of the tropical and subtropical regions before migration poleward. Occurrence of small smooth tricolpate pollen in the Aptian and Albian sediments of Libya and Egypt supports the pseudoanthial theory, and suggests that <b>wind-pollination</b> was well-established, at least, as early as the Aptian. However, coexistence of these psilate species with large coarsely sculptured insect-pollinated pollen add credibility to the idea that angiosperms are polyphyletic in origin. ...|$|E
