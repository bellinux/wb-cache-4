5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E

25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, {{he points to the}} fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

500|$|The {{film is a}} shot-for-shot {{adaptation}} of the comic book, similar to the film {{adaptation of}} Sin City.

Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal [...] "Frank Miller world" [...] of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, {{he was able to}} introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that [...] "Dilios is a guy <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> not to wreck a good story with truth."
