5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E

He was sent to Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to a treatment retreat for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete. Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked his <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> supervisory role at the center.

The next day, trainee rider Rüdiger Selig won a {{selective}} sprint finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche, beating out former Tour de France green jersey winner Baden Cooke and a field including seven first-division teams. Viganò nearly joined him on the podium, taking fourth place.

5|$|Tipu then {{ordered the}} {{destruction}} of all 27 churches in Canara. According to oral tradition, the Idgah mosque in Mangalore was constructed with stones from the destroyed Milagres Church. Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses, offices, or homes for wealthy Muslims. A popular fortification in Mangalore, the Sultan Battery, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river, was constructed with stones taken from destroyed churches. The bells from the demolished churches eventually found their <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> number of temples in the area. After being informed of the impending roundup by a friend in Tipu's government, Fr.

5|$|In 2012–13, Benfica's {{run in the}} Champions League run was not so successful, {{and they}} dropped again to the Europa League. In this tournament, however, the team excelled and reached their ninth European final, 23 years after their last appearance. On 17 May 2013, Benfica played the final against the Champions League holders Chelsea, losing 2–1 with an injury-time header from Branislav Ivanović and {{extending}} the club's run of European final losses to seven. In an almost identical 2013–14 season, Benfica competed in the Europa League after failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, and advanced all the <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second successive final. In the progress, they eliminated Juventus in the semi-finals, after a tense match in Turin, where the final was to be played. On 15 May 2014, Benfica faced the 2006 and 2007 winners Sevilla, missing usual starters Enzo Pérez, Lazar Marković and Eduardo Salvio, who were suspended due to yellow card accumulation. The match ended goalless after 120 minutes of play and was decided through a penalty shootout, which Benfica lost 4–2 after Rodrigo and Óscar Cardozo had their penalty kicks stopped by Beto. For the eight time – and second in two years – Benfica were unable to lift a European trophy. In the following season, they returned to UEFA's prime tournament, but did not progress further than the group stage {{for the fourth time}} since 2010. In 2015–16, Benfica reached their fourth knock-out stage of the Champions League. They eliminated Zenit Saint Petersburg in the last 16, and qualified for the quarter-finals for their 18th time, where they lost 3–2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} {{right of way}} of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad that included a northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times.

The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E
5|$|US2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for {{the first}} time north of {{downtown}} Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield {{on the south side of}} Sunday Lake, meeting M‑28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River. US2 and M‑64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770vehicles, compared to the overall average of 5,188vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M‑64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic.|$|E
