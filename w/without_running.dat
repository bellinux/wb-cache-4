5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Typhoon Ioke caused extensive {{damage to the}} island's power grid, leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged. The combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70% of the buildings in the territory, many of which with moderate roof damage. All low-lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand, and the territory was left <b>without</b> <b>running</b> water. Communications were downed on the island, with satellite dishes and cables destroyed. Damage to the infrastructure was extensive, though repairable and less than expected. Damage on the island was estimated at $88million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. <b>Without</b> <b>running</b> water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Flood of 1993, {{heavy rains}} {{throughout}} June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers {{to rise above}} flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during {{the early morning hours}} of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people <b>without</b> <b>running</b> water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.|$|E
25|$|Many Jews were {{deported}} to Transnistria from Bessarabia and Bukovina. During the period 19411944, 200,000 Romani people and Jews became {{victims of the}} Romanian occupation of Transnistria. Not being Romanian territory, Transnistria {{was used as a}} killing field for the extermination of Jews. Survivors say that in comparison with the Holocaust of Nazi Germany, where deportations were carefully planned, the Romanian government did not prepare to house thousands of people in Transnistria, where the deportees stayed. The people were instead placed in crude barracks <b>without</b> <b>running</b> water, electricity or latrines. Those who could not walk were simply left to die.|$|E
25|$|While {{growing up}} in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 1960s, La Luz’s {{grandfather}} used {{to take him to}} the tobacco, coffee and sugarcane fields in Puerto Rico where he witnessed first hand the plight of poor Puerto Ricans who were toiling these fields to earn their meager livelihoods. Having seen the swollen bellies of their children who were malnourished and whose fathers pushed relentlessly to work the fields while living in the poorest of conditions – many in shacks <b>without</b> <b>running</b> water, electricity and with poor hygienic conditions – La Luz began to understand the importance of working for the sensible human rights of those who had no voice. The fight for basic rights and justice for all people, no matter who they were or where they were from became his life’s passion.|$|E

They see Jake prowling around their cottage. Marwood suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed {{in the interest of}} safety, but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher is going to come after them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded with a punctured tyre.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 February 1942, Jacob Jones {{departed}} New York harbor and steamed southward along the New Jersey coast to patrol and search the area between Barnegat Light and Five Fathom Bank. Shortly after her departure, she received orders to concentrate her patrol activity in waters off Cape May and the Delaware Capes. At 1530 she spotted the burning wreckage of tanker R. P. Resor, torpedoed the previous day east of Barnegat Light; Jones circled the ship for two hours searching for survivors before resuming her southward course. Cruising at a steady 15 knots through calm seas, she last reported her position at 2000 and then commenced radio silence. A full moon lit the night sky and visibility was good; throughout the night the ship, completely darkened <b>without</b> <b>running</b> or navigation lights showing, kept her southward course.|$|E
25|$|The National Assembly is a unicameral legislature. It has 33 {{members who}} are elected for 5-year terms. Elections take place within a multi-party system; in 2009, the American NGO Freedom House ranked the Republic of Artsakh above the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan with respect to civil and {{political}} rights. Five parties have members in the parliament: the Free Motherland party has 15 members, ARF has 8 members, Democratic Party of Artsakh has 7 members, Movement 88 has 2 members and the National Revival party has one member. A number of non-partisan candidates have also taken part in the elections, with some success; in 2015, two of the 33 members to the National Assembly took their seats <b>without</b> <b>running</b> {{under the banner of}} any of the established political parties in the republic. Elections in Artsakh are not recognised by international bodies such as the European Union and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as numerous individual countries, who called them a source of increased tensions.|$|E

25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material <b>without</b> <b>running</b> the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle.|$|E
25|$|T-72UA1: {{this is a}} {{relatively}} simple upgrade developed for smaller defense budgets of {{the nations of the}} developing world, but one that has seen commercial success. The original V-46 engine was replaced with a newer 5TDFMA two-stroke diesel making 1,050hp (775kW) and fitted with an enhanced cooling system for use in tropical environments, which allows the tank to be operated for extended periods at temperatures exceeding 55°C. The tank was also equipped with an EA-10-2 APU with an output of 10kW, allowing the vehicle's systems to be fully powered when stationary <b>without</b> <b>running</b> the main engine, thus drastically reducing fuel consumption. An air-conditioner remains optional. Protection is enhanced with the use of Nozh ERA tiles on the turret while retaining the Kontakt-1 tiles on the hull (however Nozh tiles are compatible with Kontakt-1 mounting points and can be retro-fitted). The main gun, stabilizer and FCS remain unchanged compared to the T-72B. Ethiopia purchased the T-72UA1 with 72 tanks delivered in 2011 and 99 in 2012. The Ukrainian army became a customer in 2014 in response to an immediate need following the eruption of the War in Donbass. It is believed that less than 30 vehicles were ordered.|$|E
25|$|Women {{serve on}} National Assemblies. Bahá'í {{elections}} are secret ballots and electees are chosen <b>without</b> <b>running</b> for office on plurality {{up to the}} number of members of the institution. That women could be elected was in development by 1909 when the Baha'i temple unity executive board was elected in the United States. Of the nine members chosen, three were women, with Corinne True (later appointed as a Hand of the Cause) serving as an officer. The all-male administrative bodies finally were completely dissolved by `Abdu'l-Bahá in his visit to America in 1912. By 1925 the executive board evolved into the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada. There were specific developments in the eastern Bahá'í communities in 1951. At this time women were allowed to be and were elected according to the rules of Bahá'í administration to local assemblies of the Bahá'í Faith in Egypt. (indeed some were elected officers in 1952.) However, as late as the 1970s one observer could only count two women delegates out of the more than one hundred attending the national Baha'i convention in Teheran. Yet when the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Iran were arrested and executed in 1981, the chairperson was a woman, Zhinus Mahmudi. However a statistical review across continents and for the Baha'is world population shows a general upward track of women being elected to national assemblies (see graphs.) A similar pattern exists for women serving in appointed positions.|$|E
