5|$|A {{document}} of Inchaffray Abbey, {{preserved in the}} original (as opposed to a later copy), recorded that Bishop <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> been involved in settling a dispute involving Inchaffray, an abbey which lay in his diocese. Inchaffray's dispute was with Naomhán Mac Eóghainn (Nevin MacEwen) and his wife Mairead (Mariota). Under Abbot Symon de Scone, previous Abbot of Inchaffray, the abbey had given some lands in exchange for 40marks to Mairead's father Maol Mhuire (Malmoran) of Glencarnie.|$|E
5|$|In 1075, Walter {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of the force that {{prevented}} Roger de Breteuil from joining up with the other rebels during the Revolt of the Earls. <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> joined forces with Wulfstan the Bishop of Worcester, Æthelwig the Abbot of Evesham Abbey, and Urse d'Abetot the Sheriff of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In the {{administration}} of his diocese, Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents. This system was modelled on that which Hubert <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> introduced into the chancery, with separate registers for each archdeaconry, and registers, or rolls, for charters and memoranda, much like the Charter Roll or Memoranda Roll of the royal chancery. He also undertook {{a survey of the}} endowments of the vicarages within his diocese.|$|E

5|$|James Crofts, later Scott (1649–1685), created Duke of Monmouth (1663) in England and Duke of Buccleuch (1663) in Scotland. Ancestor of Sarah, Duchess of York. Monmouth {{was born}} {{nine months after}} Walter and Charles II first met, and was {{acknowledged}} as his son by Charles II, but James II suggested {{that he was the}} son of another of her lovers, Colonel Robert Sidney, rather than Charles. Lucy <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> a daughter, Mary Crofts, born after James in 1651, but Charles II was not the father, since he and Walter parted in September 1649.|$|E
5|$|Ludlow Castle was {{probably}} founded by Walter de Lacy around 1075. <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> arrived in England in 1066 {{as part of}} William fitzOsbern's household during the Norman conquest of England. FitzOsbern was made the Earl of Hereford and tasked with settling the area; at the same time, several castles were founded in {{the west of the}} county, securing its border with Wales. Walter de Lacy was the earl's second in command, and was rewarded with 163manors spread across seven counties, with 91 in Herefordshire alone.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E

5|$|In 1223, King HenryIII {{met with}} the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth at Ludlow Castle for peace talks, but the {{negotiations}} were unsuccessful. The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter's activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, Ludlow Castle {{was taken over by}} the Crown for a period of two years. This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry's enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000marks for the return of his castles and lands. During the 1230s, however, <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay. As a result, in 1238 he gave Ludlow Castle as collateral to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.|$|E
5|$|Later, he {{attended}} the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and graduated in 1926 as the senior class Salutatorian. At Penn, he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi, and he also {{served as president of}} the Phi Deuteron Charge. Upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science his father gave him a cabin cruiser that slept eight. He was also Junior and Senior class president. O’Malley originally enrolled at Columbia University in New York City for law school, but after his family lost their money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he switched from Columbia Law School to night school at Fordham University. Edwin O'Malley's dry goods business was failing and <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> to help run the business.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkist Edward IV gave Farleigh Hungerford Castle to {{his brother}} Richard, then Duke of Gloucester, in 1462. Edward and Richard's brother George Plantagenet may have taken up {{residence}} at the castle; his daughter Margaret was certainly born there. Richard became king in 1483 and gave the castle to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk. Meanwhile, the late Robert's youngest son, Sir <b>Walter,</b> <b>had</b> become a close supporter of Edward IV; nonetheless, he joined the failed revolt of 1483 against Richard and ended up detained in the Tower of London. When Henry Tudor invaded England in 1485, Walter escaped custody and joined the invading Lancastrian army, fighting alongside Henry at the Battle of Bosworth. Victorious, the newly crowned Henry VII returned Farleigh Hungerford to Walter in 1486.|$|E

5|$|Between 1430 and 1445 Walter {{expanded}} the castle considerably. An outer court {{was built to}} {{the south side of}} the original castle, with its own towers and an additional gatehouse which formed the new entrance to the castle. These new defences were less strong than those of the original inner court, and indeed the eastern gatehouse was not crenellated at the time. A barbican was built, extending the older gatehouse to the inner court. The new court enclosed the parish church, which became the castle chapel, with a replacement church being built by Walter in the village. <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> the chapel decorated with a number of murals, depicting scenes from the story of Saint George and the Dragon; Saint George was a favoured saint of Henry V, and associated with the prestigious Order of the Garter, of which Walter was a proud member. A house was built next to the chapel for the use of the chantry priest. Walter also legally combined the two parishes of Farleigh in Somerset and Wittenham in Wiltshire, which formed part of his castle's park, altering the county boundaries of Somerset and Wiltshire in the process. As a village, Wittenham disappeared completely.|$|E
5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> William Bell remove a piece of his brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E

25|$|Walter's {{daughter}} Gretel {{was murdered}} on August 21, 1939 in Berlin by her husband, who then killed himself; his motive was jealousy over her growing {{relationship with the}} Italian bass singer Ezio Pinza. Walter's wife fell into a permanent depression and died in 1945, and Walter blamed himself for the tragedy, as his daughter had met Pinza only because <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> made special efforts to hire him to sing the role of Don Giovanni.|$|E
25|$|About 1186 <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> {{witnessed}} {{with his}} father the land grant of Maud de Hagarnel to the priory of Brecon. About 1190 Devereux granted 12 acres of land near Berrington (Hereford) to the same priory ‘for the love he bore his lord, William de Braose the younger.’ This identifies Walter Devereux {{as a member of}} the military retinue of the Braose family. Devereux also witnessed the grant of land by William de Bradfelde of lands in Bradfield, Petercroft, Laneglege, lands near Mara, Estlege, and in Weteroft near the chapel to the priory of Brecon. In 1211, Walter Devereux was listed as having held 1/2 knight's fee of the honor of Brecon.|$|E

25|$|According to biographical {{research}} by Hugh Noel Williams (1870–1925), Charles had not arrived at The Hague {{until the middle}} of September 1648 – seven months before the child's birth (but he met Lucy for the first time nine months before) — and some unfounded voices whispered that Lucy <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> in the summer of 1648 been mistress of Colonel Robert Sidney, a younger son of the Earl of Leicester. When the child grew to manhood, contemporaries observed that he bore a strong resemblance to Sidney. The unfounded voices had probably originated from the Duke of York, brother of King Charles II, who was afraid of his nephew's potential claim to the throne.|$|E
25|$|The {{widely publicized}} case of Christine and Walter Collins was {{depicted}} in the 2008 film Changeling. In March 1928, Christine Collins reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing. Five months later a boy named Arthur Hutchins came forth claiming to be Walter. When Mrs. Collins tried to tell the police that the boy was not her son, she was committed to a mental institution under a Section 12 internment. It was later determined that <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> actually fallen victim to a child rapist/murderer in the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Arthur Hutchins eventually {{admitted that he had}} lied about his identity {{in order to get to}} Hollywood and meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix.|$|E
25|$|At 08:35am on 13 March 1928 Endeavour {{took off}} from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, with minimal fuss as <b>Walter</b> <b>had</b> told only two friends and Elsie had {{registered}} under the pseudonym of 'Gordon Sinclair'. Approximately five hours later, at 13.30pm the Chief lighthouse keeper at Mizen Head on the south west coast of Cork Ireland saw the monoplane over the village of Crookhaven, on the great circle course for Newfoundland. A French steamer later reported seeing them still on course, but nothing else is known. A crowd of 5,000 is reputed to have waited at Mitchel Field, Long Island. In December 1928, eight months later, {{a single piece of}} identifiable undercarriage washed ashore in North West Ireland.|$|E
