50|$|By implication, {{the class}} is also {{described}} as not <b>having</b> <b>the</b> features +continuant or +voice. This means that all sounds with either the feature +continuant (able to be lengthened in pronunciation) or +voice (pronounced with vibration of the vocal chords) are excluded from the class. This excludes all natural classes of sounds besides voiceless stops. For instance, it excludes voiceless fricatives, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> feature +continuant, voiced stops, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> feature +voice, and liquids and vowels, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> features +continuant and +voice.|$|R

5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> adverbial form well.|$|E

After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, the striking new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall, was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by Lauridtz Jensen.|$|E
