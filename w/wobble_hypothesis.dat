40|$|Background: Animal {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically encode one tRNA {{for each}} synonymous codon family, {{so that each}} tRNA anticodon essentially has to wobble to recognize two or four synonymous codons. Several factors have been hypothesized to determine the nucleotide at the wobble site of a tRNA anticodon in mitochondrial genomes, such as the codon-anticodon adaptation <b>hypothesis,</b> the <b>wobble</b> versatility <b>hypothesis,</b> the translation initiation and elongation conflict <b>hypothesis,</b> and the <b>wobble</b> cost <b>hypothesis.</b> Principal Findings: In this study, we analyzed codon usage and tRNA anticodon wobble sites of 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes to evaluate features of the wobble nucleotides in tRNA anticodons. The strand-specific mutation bias favors G and T on the H strand in all the 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes. A bias favoring G and T is also visible in the third codon positions of protein-coding genes and the wobble sites of anticodons, rejecting that codon usage bias drives the wobble sites of tRNA anticodons or tRNA anticodon bias drives the evolution of codon usage. Almost all codon families (98. 9 %) from marine bivalve mitogenomes support the <b>wobble</b> versatility <b>hypothesis.</b> There are a few interesting exceptions involving tRNA Trp with an anticodon CCA fixed in Pectinoida species, tRNA Ser with a GCU anticodon fixed in Mytiloida mitogenomes, and the uniform anticodon CAU of tRNA Met translating the AUR codon family.

40|$|Abstract Background Fungal {{and animal}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically have one tRNA for each synonymous codon family. The codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis {{predicts that the}} wobble nucleotide of a tRNA anticodon should evolve towards maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing with {{the most frequently used}} codon within each synonymous codon family, whereas the <b>wobble</b> versatility <b>hypothesis</b> argues that the nucleotide at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in wobble pairing, i. e., the tRNA wobble nucleotide should be G for NNY codon families, and U for NNR and NNN codon families (where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G and N for any nucleotide). Results We here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on tRNA anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the wobble costs associated with different wobble base pairs. This novel approach allows the relative cost of wobble pairing to be qualitatively evaluated. A comprehensive study of 36 fungal genomes suggests very different costs between two kinds of U:G wobble pairs, i. e., (1) between a G at the wobble site of a tRNA anticodon and a U at the third codon position (designated M U 3 :G) and (2) between a U at the wobble site of a tRNA anticodon and a G at the third codon position (designated M G 3 :U). Conclusion In general, M U 3 :G is much smaller than M G 3 :U, suggesting no selection against U-ending codons in NNY codon families with a wobble G in the tRNA anticodon but strong selection against G-ending codons in NNR codon families with a wobble U at the tRNA anticodon. This finding resolves several puzzling observations in fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that U 3 :G wobble is energetically more favorable than G 3 :U wobble. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{the genetic}} code, there are 43 = 64 {{possible}} codons (tri-nucleotide sequences). For translation, {{each of these}} codons requires a tRNA molecule with a complementary anticodon. If each tRNA molecule paired with its complementary mRNA codon using canonical Watson-Crick base pairing, then 64 types (species) of tRNA molecule would be required. In the standard genetic code, three of these 64 mRNA codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) are stop codons. These terminate translation by binding to release factors rather than tRNA molecules, so canonical pairing would require 61 species of tRNA. Since most organisms have fewer than 45 species of tRNA, some tRNA species must pair {{with more than one}} codon. In 1966, Francis Crick proposed the <b>Wobble</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> to account for this. He postulated that the 5' base on the anticodon, which binds to the 3' base on the mRNA, was not as spatially confined as the other two bases, and could, thus, have non-standard base pairing. Crick creatively named it for the small amount of play that occurs at this third codon position. Movement ("wobble") of the base in the 5' anticodon position is necessary for small conformational adjustments that affect the overall pairing geometry of anticodons of tRNA.|$|E

The detailed 3-D atomic structures {{of a series of}} proteins, and how they function, were deduced. These included myoglobin, hemoglobin and chymotrypsin, the last by David Blow. The genetic code, from evidence around the world, was assembled by Crick. Punctuation signals in the messenger RNA — where to start translating the RNA into a protein sequence, and where to stop — were discovered. Crick suggested how the tRNA molecules — his original adaptors — read the messenger in his <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Sanger devised new methods for sequencing RNA molecules and then later for DNA molecules (for which he received a second Nobel prize in chemistry in 1980). Much later, this line was extended to include determining the sequence of whole genomes, in which John Sulston played a key role. How tRNA precursor molecules are processed to give a functional tRNA was elucidated by John Smith and Sid Altman, and this later led to the discovery of ribozymes. The atomic structure of the first tRNA molecule was solved and zinc fingers discovered by Klug (who received the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1982). The structure of the ATP synthase was solved by John E. Walker and Andrew Leslie, for which Walker shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1997.

40|$|Systematic {{studies of}} basal {{nonsense}} suppression, orthogonality of tRNAPyl variants, and cross recognition between codons and tRNA anticodons are reported. E. coli displays detectable basal amber and opal suppression but shows a negligible ochre suppression. Although detectable, basal amber suppression is fully inhibited when a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) -tRNAPyl_CUA pair is genetically encoded. trnaPyl_CUA is aminoacylated by an E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase {{at a low}} level, however, this misaminoacylation is fully inhibited when both PylRS and its substrate are present. Besides that it is fully orthogonal in E. coli and can be coupled with PylRS to genetically incorporate a NAA at an ochre codon, tRNAPyl_UUA {{is not able to}} recognize an UAG codon to induce amber suppression. This observation is in direct conflict with the <b>wobble</b> base pair <b>hypothesis</b> and enables using an evolved M. jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNAPyl_UUA pair and the wild type or evolved PylRS-tRNAPyl_UUA pair to genetically incorporate two different NAAs at amber and ochre codons. tRNAPyl_UCA is charged by E. coli tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, thus not orthogonal in E. coli. Mutagenic studies of trnaPyl_UCA led to the discovery of its G 73 U form which shows a higher orthogonality.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{relative}} stabilities, {{in the form}} of complex lifetimes, of complexes between the tRNAs complementary, or nearly so, in their anticodons. The results show striking parallels with the genetic coding rules, including the wobble interaction and the role of modified nucleotides S 2 U and V (a 5 -oxyacetic acid derivative of U). One important difference between the genetic code and the pairing rules in the tRNA-tRNA interaction is the stability in the latter of the short wobble pairs, which the <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis</b> excludes. We stress the potential of U for translational errors, and suggest a simple stereochemical basis for ribosome-mediated discrimination against short wobble pairs.

40|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the adaptor {{molecule}} {{responsible for}} bringing the correct amino acid to the ribosome during protein synthesis. tRNA contains a number of modified nucleosides, which are derivatives of the four normal nucleosides. A great variety of modifications {{are found in the}} anticodon loop, especially at the first (wobble) position of the anticodon. According to Crick’s <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> a uridine at the wobble position of tRNA recognize codons ending with A and G. Uridine- 5 -oxyacetic acid (cmo 5 U 34), found at the wobble position of six species of tRNA in Salmonella enterica, have been predicted to expand the codon recognition of uridine to include U-ending, but not C-ending codons. To study the function of cmo 5 U 34 we have identified two genes, cmoA and cmoB, which are required for the synthesis of cmo 5 U 34 in tRNA. We have shown that the proline, alanine and valine tRNAs containing cmo 5 U 34 are capable of reading codons ending with any of the four nucleotides, while the threonine tRNA is not, and the importance of having cmo 5 U is different for the different tRNAs. In addition, we found that cmo 5 U is important for efficient reading of G-ending codons, which is surprising considering the <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> which states that uridine should read G-ending codons. The dominant + 1 frameshift suppressor sufY suppresses the hisC 3737 + 1 frameshift mutation. We have demonstrated that sufY induces frameshifting at CCC-CAA (Pro-Gln), when tRNAPro[cmo 5 UGG] occupies the P-site. sufY mutants accumulate novel modified nucleosides at the wobble position of tRNAs that should normally have (c) mnm 5 s 2 U 34. The presence of an extra sidechain (C 10 H 17) on the wobble nucleoside of tRNAGln[(c) mnm 5 s 2 U] leads to slow decoding of CAA codons, inducing a translational pause that allows the P-site peptidyl-tRNAPro[cmo 5 UGG] to slip into the + 1 frame. We have characterized 108 independent frameshift suppressor mutants in the gene encoding tRNAPro[cmo 5 UGG]. The altered tRNAs are still able to read all four proline codons in the A-site, but induce frameshifts after translocation into the P-site. Some of the mutations are in regions of the tRNA that are involved in interactions with components of the P-site. We hypothesize that the ribosomal P-site keeps a “grip” of the peptidyl-tRNA to prevent loss of the reading frame...|$|E

Similar to tRNA(CUA) (Pyl), tRNA(UUA) (Pyl) is also orthogonal in E. coli and can be coupled with PylRS to genetically incorporate BocK at an ochre mutation site. Although tRNA(UUA) (Pyl) is expected to recognize a UAG codon based on the <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> the PylRS-tRNA(UUA) (Pyl) pair does not give rise to amber suppression that surpasses the basal amber suppression level in E. coli. E. coli itself displays a relatively high opal suppression level and tryptophan (Trp) is incorporated at an opal mutation site. Although the PylRS-tRNA(UCA) (Pyl) pair {{can be used to}} encode BocK at an opal codon, the pair fails to suppress the incorporation of Trp at the same site. tRNA(CCU) (Pyl) fails to deliver BocK at an AGG codon when co-expressed with PylRS in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|According to Crick's <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> tRNAs with uridine at the wobble {{position}} (position 34) recognize A- and G-, but not U- or C-ending codons. However, U in the wobble {{position is}} almost always modified, and Salmonella enterica tRNAs containing the modified nucleoside uridine- 5 -oxyacetic acid (cmo 5 U 34) at this position are predicted to recognize U- (but not C-) ending codons, in addition to A- and G-ending codons. We have constructed a set of S. enterica mutants with only the cmo 5 U-containing tRNA left to read all four codons in the proline, alanine, valine, and threonine family codon boxes. From the phenotypes of these mutants, we deduce that the proline, alanine, and valine tRNAs containing cmo 5 U read all four codons including the C-ending codons, while the corresponding threonine tRNA does not. A cmoB mutation, leading to cmo 5 U deficiency in tRNA, was introduced. Monitoring A-site selection rates in vivo revealed {{that the presence of}} cmo 5 U 34 stimulated the reading of CCU and CCC (Pro), GCU (Ala), and GUC (Val) codons.

Two natural suppressor tRNAs were purified from uninfected tobacco plants {{on the basis}} of their ability to promote readthrough over the corresponding UAG termination codon in vitro. In a reticulocyte lysate the yield of 183 -K readthrough protein increases from ˜ 10 % in the absence of added tobacco plant tRNA up to ˜ 35 % in the case of pure tRNATyr added.

40|$|Recombination {{occurring}} during meiosis {{is critical}} for creating genetic variation and plays {{an essential role in}} plant evolution. In addition to creating novel gene combinations, recombination can affect genome structure through altering GC patterns. In maize (Zea mays) and other grasses, another intriguing GC pattern exists. Maize genes show a bimodal GC content distribution that has been attributed to nucleotide bias in the third, or wobble, position of the codon. Recombination may be an underlying driving force given that recombination sites are often associated with high GC content. Here we explore the relationship between recombination and genomic GC patterns by comparing GC gene content at each of the three codon positions (GC 1, GC 2, and GC 3, collectively termed GCx) to instances of a variable GC-rich motif that underlies double strand break (DSB) hotspots and to meiocyte-specific gene expression. Surprisingly, GCx bimodality in maize cannot be fully explained by the codon <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> High GCx genes show a strong overlap with the DSB hotspot motif, possibly providing a mechanism for the high evolutionary rates seen in these genes. On the other hand, genes that are turned on in meiosis (early prophase I) are biased against both high GCx genes and genes with the DSB hotspot motif, possibly allowing important meiotic genes to avoid DSBs. Our data suggests a strong link between the GC-rich motif underlying DSB hotspots and high GCx genes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{ab initio}} model for gene {{prediction}} in prokaryotic genomes is proposed based on physicochemical characteristics of codons calculated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The model requires a specification of three calculated quantities for each codon: the double-helical trinucleotide base pairing energy, the base pair stacking energy, and {{an index of}} the propensity of a codon for protein-nucleic acid interactions. The base pairing and stacking energies for each codon are obtained from recently reported MD simulations on all unique tetranucleotide steps, and the third parameter is assigned based on the conjugate rule previously proposed {{to account for the}} <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis</b> with respect to degeneracies in the genetic code. The third interaction propensity parameter values correlate well with ab initio MD calculated solvation energies and flexibility of codon sequences as well as codon usage in genes and amino acid composition frequencies in ∼ 175, 000 protein sequences in the Swissprot database. Assignment of these three parameters for each codon enables the calculation of the magnitude and orientation of a cumulative three-dimensional vector for a DNA sequence of any length in each of the six genomic reading frames. Analysis of 372 genomes comprising ∼ 350, 000 genes shows that the orientations of the gene and nongene vectors are well differentiated and make a clear distinction feasible between genic and nongenic sequences at a level equivalent to or better than currently available knowledge-based models trained on the basis of empirical data, presenting a strong support for the possibility of a unique and useful physicochemical characterization of DNA sequences from codons to genomes...|$|E
40|$|Five serine {{and three}} leucine isoaceptor tRNAs were {{purified}} from the asporogenic yeast Candida cylindracea, in which codon CUG is translated as serine instead of leucine, and their primary structures were determined. From the <b>wobble</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> {{it was assumed}} that one of the tRNA(Leu) species (Leu 1), with the anticodon CmAA, corresponded to the UUG leucine codon, and that the remaining two leucine tRNAs (Leu 2 and Leu 3), with the same IAG anticodon sequence would decode the CUU, CUC and CUA codons as leucine, but not the CUG codon; this was clarified by an in vitro translation experiment with C. cylindracea using synthetic mRNAs containing the CUA or CUG codons. One of the serine tRNAs (Ser 1) has already been demonstrated to have the anticodon CAG and to be responsible for translation of the codon CUG in C. cylindracea. Three of the other species of tRNA(Ser) (Ser 2, 3 and 4), with the anticodon sequences cm 5 UGA, IGA and CGA, can translate all four codons in the UCN codon box, while the remaining species (Ser 5), with the anticodon GCU, corresponds to AGU and AGC serine codons. The gene sequences for these five serine and three leucine tRNAs were also determined, with the finding that only tRNA(Ser) CAG (Ser 1) has an intron. At least five different types of tRNA(Ser) CAG genes exist in the genome of C. cylindracea. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking regions of these tRNA(Ser) CAG genes indicated that the tRNA(Ser) CAG gene has duplicated at least three times on the genome. The existence of multiple genes for tRNA(Ser) CAG on the genome may account for the observation that codon CUG is used very frequently in C. cylindracea. All of these tRNASerCAG genes contain the CCA sequence in their 3 ' termini, suggesting the possibility that during their multiplication process {{in the evolution of the}} C. cylindracea genome, the tRNA(Ser) CAG molecule was integrated into DNA via reverse transcription...|$|E
