In Saint James Parish, emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August11. Late on August11, emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish. In Saint Elizabeth Parish, 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish. A total of $1.5million (JMD; US$17,000) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm. The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{rainfall}} thresholds {{can be the}} key {{to ensuring}} effective debris-flow forecasting. They are significant {{for the study of the}} trigger mechanisms of debris flows, for the forecast of the characteristics of future events, and for the development of engineering guidance for mitigation. Using a hydrological approach, we first calculated the flood peak discharge at different frequencies and then the corresponding rainfall thresholds for the initiation of different scales of debris flows in Zhouqu County, China. This was followed by the establishment of a functional relation between the intensity and duration of rainfall events that trigger debris flows of different <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> in two initial soil conditions (dry and moist). This, in turn, yielded four <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> and two preliminary <b>warning</b> <b>levels.</b> For the two early soil conditions (dry and moist) in the Sanyanyu Gully of Zhouqu County, the <b>Level</b> I (red) <b>warning</b> values for rainfall triggering debris flow are 56 and 51 mm h(- 1), respectively; the <b>Level</b> II (orange) <b>warning</b> values are 41 and 38 mm h(- 1), respectively; the <b>Level</b> III (yellow) <b>warning</b> values are 32 and 30 mm h(- 1), respectively; and the <b>Level</b> IV (blue) <b>warning</b> values are 24 and 22 mm h(- 1), respectively. The <b>Level</b> V preliminary <b>warning</b> values are 17 and 16 mm h(- 1), respectively; and the <b>Level</b> VI preliminary <b>warning</b> values are 10 and 9. 5 mm h(- 1), respectively. The rainfall intensity and duration were found to exhibit a power function relation, I = alpha D-beta, where the values of alpha and beta vary with the <b>warning</b> <b>levels.</b> Rainfall events capable of triggering debris flows in the new thresholds and intensity-duration relations presented here can be used for forecasting purposes and in operational geohazard warning systems. These research results also provide a scientific basis for regional hazard mitigation and reduction in Zhouqu County...|$|R

40|$|Governments, aid {{organizations}} and researchers {{are struggling with}} the complexity of detecting and monitoring drought events, which leads to weaknesses regarding the translation of early warnings into action. Embedded in an advanced decision-support framework for Doctors without Borders (Médecins sans Frontières), this study focuses on identifying the added-value of combining different satellite-derived datasets for drought monitoring and forecasting in Ethiopia. The core {{of the study is}} the improvement of an existing drought index via methodical adaptations and the integration of various satellite-derived datasets. The resulting Enhanced Combined Drought Index (ECDI) links four input datasets (rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation status). The respective weight of each input dataset is calculated for every grid point at a spatial resolution of 0. 25 degrees (roughly 28 kilometers). In the case of data gaps in one input dataset, the weights are automatically redistributed to other available variables. Ranking the years 1992 to 2014 according to the ECDI-based <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> allows for the identification of all large-scale drought events in Ethiopia. Our results also indicate a good match between the ECDI-based drought <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> and reported drought impacts for both the start {{and the end of the}} season...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence {{that exposure to}} air pollution is harmful to health. In the USA, ambient air quality is monitored by Federal and State agencies for regulatory purposes. There are limited options, however, for people to access this data in real time, which hinders an individual’s ability to manage their own risks. This paper describes a new software package that models environmental concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), coarse particulate matter (PM 10) and ozone concentrations {{for the state of}} Oregon and calculates personal health risks at the smartphone’s current location. Predicted air pollution risk levels can be displayed on mobile devices as interactive maps and graphs color-coded to coincide with Environmental Protection Agency air quality index categories. Users have the option of setting air quality <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> via color-coded bars and are notified whenever <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> are exceeded by predicted levels within 10 km. We validated the software using data from participants as well as from simulations, which showed that the application was capable of identifying spatial and temporal air quality trends. This unique application provides a potential low-cost technology for reducing personal exposure to air pollution which can improve quality of life, particularly for people with health conditions, such as asthma, that make them more susceptible to these hazards...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The thermal {{environment}} in living spaces has been worse because {{of global warming}} and urban heat islands, {{and the risk of}} heat disorders has also increased recently. In order to prevent heat disorders, Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) were used as the index of {{thermal environment}} condition. In Japan, Ministry of the Environment offers the hourly WBGT on the web site, which is calculated from meteorological data at each meteorological observation station. Therefore, the WBGT data is not spatially continuous data. In this study, we developed the method for estimating WBGT using remote sensing data by combining bio-geophysical parameters in order to obtain continuous spatial distribution of WBGT in Japan. This method used the Multi-functional Transport Satellite- 2 (MTSAT- 2) data, clear-sky solar radiation data, normalized difference vegetation index data, and elevation data as the variables of WBGT estimate formula. The estimation accuracy was evaluated by RMSE, an overall accuracy, and a kappa coefficient. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficients were calculated using confusion matrix when the observed and estimated WBGTs were classified into several <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> of heat disorders based on WBGT criteria of heat disorder prevention guidelines. The RMSE was approximately 2. 7 degree Celsius, the overall accuracy was over 64 %, and kappa coefficient was 0. 49. Thus, it was revealed that it was difficult to use estimated WBGT values directly for heat disorder prevention, but the maps of heat disorder <b>warning</b> <b>levels</b> could be created using MTSAT- 2 data with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
