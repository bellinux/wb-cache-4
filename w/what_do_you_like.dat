At this time Lucy's {{wardrobe}} was not yet of a nature to need much work over its ravages. The Dormer girls had hardly known where their frocks had come from when they wanted frocks,--hardly with more precision than the Tringle girls. Frocks had come--dark, gloomy frocks, lately, alas! And these, too, had now come a second time. Let creditors be ever so unsatisfied, new raiment will always be found for mourning families. Everything about Lucy was nearly new. The need of repairing would come upon her by degrees, but it had not come as yet. Therefore there had seemed, to the anxious aunt, to be a necessity for some such question as the above.|$|E

[...] The class answered: [...] "We like playing games." [...] "What games?" [...] They told me, and I began then and there to write them down. In the afternoon whilst teaching mathematics in Edinburgh {{part of the school}} inside Edinburgh's boundary, I also found time to jot down some more games. From then on I collected every sort of rhyme or playing jingle, and my collection grew."The U.S. folk-song collector Alan Lomax made audio recordings of the Norton Park pupils during the first of his three field trips to Scotland in 1951, 1953 and 1957. These can be heard on the still widely available CD entitled Singing in the Streets: Scottish Children’s Songs. Lomax was a major inspiration behind the founding of the School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh University in the same year the film was first shown.|$|E

A panel featuring editors Ann Close and Joy Johannesson and publisher Michael Pietsch concludes the program.

40|$|Well-being is a {{state of}} general “wellness” which can make us lazy in our efforts to improve the world. I have {{proposed}} “well-becoming” as a more active, procedural way to conceptualize the quest for well-being. Inspired by a colloquium recently in Finland I wish to explore how we can “well be-love” or do “well be-loving,” in a Barbara Frederickson positive psychology way that enhances our health and happiness as she describes in her book Love 2. 0 (2013). I believe that {{one of the ways that}} this happens in my classes is through singing short songlets, with call and response routines, which begin as speed dictations that students help each other with and then turn into short conversational routines. I will be singing with the audience several songlets which basically answer some our most enduring questions in our lives and whose answers give us guidance and hope: How are you? How do you have a good life? How do you succeed? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like?</b> What do you love? Who do you love? What should we notice? What is good advice? These can then become call and response short conversation with our students. I will have further documentation about the benefits of singing from a variety of disciplines.

40|$|Teaching English as {{a foreign}} {{language}} is something challenging. Teachers of foreign language should have good language skills of the second language they teach because they provide the main language input for the students who may have limited exposure outside of classroom. A good teaching and learning process does not only put the qualified teachers as a single main source but also involves the students in that process. The teachers actually can use the students’ knowledge to construct or build their understanding by asking them some questions such as <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> giving them some clues like before we make a descriptive text we should make… [...] , or providing some variations in their teaching to create the students understanding. The scaffolds facilitate the students’ ability to build on prior knowledge and internalize new information. The objective {{of the study is}} to identify and classify the teachers’ scaffolding talks by describing the types of scaffolding talks the teachers use in their classes, functions of each scaffolding talks and the reasons of using such scaffolding talks. This research is qualitative. It was conducted at first grade of bilingual class of SMP 01 Tayu. The numbers of this subject are two English Teachers. The data were collected from classroom observation and interview. The data from observation were analyzed whether they belong to scaffolding talks or not. The functions of scaffolding talks were classified through components provided by Turney et al. the data from interview were transcribed and interpret to know the reasons of using such scaffolding talks. Based on the data obtained, it is reported that the teachers used scaffolding talks through the teaching and learning process. The types of scaffolding that used by the teachers were inviting students’ participation, inviting students to contribute clues, verifying and clarifying students’ understanding and providing model. The functions of scaffolding talks performed by the teachers in the classrooms were explaining for example simple present tense is used to express everyday activities. Questioning like could you make the simple present tense in negative form?, Reinforcement such as good, excellent, nice or signaling ok and introductory procedures and closures. The teachers used almost of the lesson to explaining and questioning, sometime they gave reinforcement to their study but thy only spent a little time to attract their students’ attention and motivation to the topics. The teachers used such scaffolding talks are to make their students more understand and keep the students motivation and interest to their lesson...|$|E
