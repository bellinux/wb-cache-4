In Phase A, 24 parents were observed measuring child height using <b>written</b> <b>instructions</b> and an easy-to-read tape measure; after each of 3 testing rounds, instructions were refined based on observed errors and parent versus researcher measurements.

40|$|Combining {{traditional}} analytical {{narrative and}} postmodern presentation of polyphonic voices, my study engages {{in a historical}} examination of English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> in Chinese colleges since 1862. The present study is primarily concerned about (1) how socio-cultural changes in Chinese society shaped pedagogical discourse; (2) what was the relationship between theory, research and practice; and (3) what was the relationship between Chinese and English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction.</b> Over {{one and a half}} century, college students in China invariably bore the burden of having to think and write in the “foreign devil 2 ̆ 7 s” mindset while breathing in the Chinese cultural milieu. After the Opium Wars, Chinese students began to be exposed to the Western rhetorical tradition, particularly scientific rhetoric as manifested in science and technology textbooks. Systematic English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> in Chinese colleges surfaced {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century. In foreign mission colleges, equal emphasis was placed on English literature and composition; while in some state universities, translation was also emphasized, revealing a nationalistic project, i. e., to expose more Chinese people to Western learning through translated works so as to build a strong nation. Starting from the 1910 s, English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> in both state and private schools was unified under current-traditional rhetoric, resulting from the conflation of Western and Chinese rhetorical traditions. In Maoist China (1949 – 1976), English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> was reduced to a rudimentary level due to various international and domestic political movements. In the late 1970 s, English was once again required in colleges as a vital means for introducing Western technology and investment in the country. In the late 1980 s, English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> in colleges witnessed some improvement. In the 1990 s, English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction,</b> as considered by many people in China, adopted a modern version of the eight-legged essay type of pedagogy and encouraged college students to write English in hybridized styles. My dissertation concludes this historical narrative by calling attention to the uniqueness of the history of English <b>writing</b> <b>instruction</b> in China, and suggesting that similar historical inquires at other locales are needed for composition studies when it works to address writing issues of both national and international nature. ...|$|R
