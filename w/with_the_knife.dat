5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung at him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with his other hand. He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and was {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. Most of the episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences. [...] For example, Elaine's father, a published author, was inspired by Richard Yates, author of Revolutionary Road, who Larry David had met while dating his daughter. [...] Tierney's performance as Elaine's father was praised by the cast and crew. However, they were taken aback by his eccentric behavior, and {{it was discovered that}} he stole a knife from the set which Jerry Seinfeld noticed. Lawrence then joked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> in a manner resembling Psycho towards Jerry. The majority of the episode was filmed on December 4, 1990. [...] "The Jacket" [...] premiered on American television on February 6, 1991, on NBC, it gained a Nielsen rating of 10.4/16 and was praised by critics.|$|E

[...] Yunkin stated that he had not participated in the murder. Yunkin stated that while he was under the {{impression}} that Lambert and Buck were going to cut Show's hair <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> as a prank, he did help provide an alibi and helped to dispose of evidence. This testimony would later change as Lambert and Buck both recanted their initial testimonies, with Lambert stating that an abusive Yunkin had encouraged her to harass and assault Show.|$|E
2500|$|Kater built a {{reversible}} pendulum (shown at right) {{consisting of a}} brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular [...] "knife" [...] blades (a) near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod (b,c). In operation, the pendulum is hung {{in front of a}} precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration g very accurately.|$|E

He then came to the town of Daura (located in modern day Katsina State), where he entered a house and asked an old woman for water. She informed him that a serpent named Sarki (sarki is the Hausa word for king) guarded the well and that the people were only allowed to draw water once a week. Bayajidda set out for the well and killed the serpent with the sword and beheaded it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> the blacksmiths had made for him, after which he drank the water, put the head in a bag, and returned to the old woman's house.

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife,</b> resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{believed it}} had a strong case {{despite the lack of}} known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon. Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Nicole Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was {{getting ready to go to}} bed herself when she opened the front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Ron Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm choke-hold. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife,</b> severing her carotid artery. They argued further that Simpson left a [...] "trail of blood" [...] from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.|$|E
