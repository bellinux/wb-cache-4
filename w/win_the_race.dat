5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Gianni Bugno.

5|$|If Crash, Coco or Crunch <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> Velo, {{having lost}} his {{influence}} over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots. Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo {{in exchange for}} sending the Bandicoots back to Earth. If Cortex, N. Gin or Tiny <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power {{in an attempt to}} return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives (all of which resemble Krunk), Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.|$|E

5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto went on to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race {{at the back of the}} pack and passed the entire field within four laps to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E

5|$|Luis Gómez, an El Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg {{entered the}} round as the {{defending}} race winner and championship leader, with a twenty-four-point advantage over teammate Lewis Hamilton.
