500|$|F.E.A.R. was {{announced}} at an E3 2004 pre-show, though its existence as an untitled project was revealed {{prior to this}} announcement. The game's first trailer later premiered at E3 2004 and was well received by critics. During the E3 2004 showing, F.E.A.R.s lead designer, Craig Hubbard, stated that the game [...] "... evolved out of a concept we started developing right after [...] that we've been dying to work on." [...] Monolith Productions' director of technology, Kevin Stephens, later elaborated that this concept was [...] "... to make an action movie in a first-person shooter, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> feel like an action star." [...] To this effect, the team focused on immersing the player, using elements like a silent, nameless protagonist with an unknown background, and allowing the player to see the protagonist's body when looking down or sideways.|$|E
500|$|Elvis Costello and Brian Eno's track, [...] "My Dark Life", {{came about}} {{as a result of}} album {{producer}} David Was asking Costello to provide a song that would sound like [...] "'you went into the studio with Brian Eno"—the two musicians had recently met at a film screening at Paul McCartney's home, and reconvened to record the song the following week. R.E.M. and author William S. Burroughs collaborated on a new version of [...] "Star Me Kitten", a song that had originally appeared on the band's 1992 album Automatic for the People. Rob Zombie has described his collaboration with Alice Cooper on the song [...] "Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)" [...] as one of the [...] "great moments <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> feel like you've made your dreams come true". Zombie and Cooper were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1997 for the song, losing out to Rage Against the Machine's [...] "Tire Me".|$|E

500|$|While Radiohead has {{expressed}} anti-war sentiments in the past—including {{a contribution to}} the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] marks {{the first time that a}} Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to the point <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need to read the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, co-writer Cargill {{stated that}} Marvel felt some initial {{ideas for the}} film from him and Derrickson {{highlighted}} {{too much of the}} [...] "weird stuff" [...] associated with the character to feature in an origin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films. In October 2016, Derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel, saying, [...] "I love the character, I love the visual possibilities, and I know the comics so well— the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." [...] He would like to follow the example of The Dark Knight and [...] "bring in a villain <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> got to go deep [...] a more visceral experience". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange solo film. Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing Clea appear in a potential sequel. By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, Locke & Key.|$|E

The head coach of Northwestern University's women's swim team was quoted {{just prior to the}} Olympics that year as saying, [...] "Anita has technically a perfect breaststroke. The breaststroke is very much a lower body stroke <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> use your legs. She uses her body perfectly and gets the most out of her stroke technique-wise". Nall went on to swim the breaststroke leg of the 4 × 100 m medley relay at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, winning the team gold medal and becoming the youngest American gold medalist in swimming since 1976.|$|E

2500|$|... "Adieu" [...] ("Farewell"), is a 1960s-inspired pop song, {{featuring}} a double bassline and [...] "stomping" [...] percussion in the vein of Bo Diddley. It was released as the album's first single on September 19 and topped CBC Radio 3's The R3-30 singles chart for two consecutive weeks in November. Lyrically, [...] "Adieu" [...] deals with what Martin {{describes as the}} phase of [...] "the break-up <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> just want the other person to disappear... {{you want to stop}} thinking about them", though she also clarifies that [...] "it's a general break-up song, it doesn't talk about one person in particular". A music video for the song, directed by Jérémie Saindon, features Niels Schneider as Martin's boyfriend whose infidelity provokes her to enact revenge on his various partners, and eventually him as well. The concept was inspired by the 1960s sitcom Bewitched and styled with touches of both retro and modern.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{incorporates}} jargon {{from the}} est {{training in the}} work. He alternates between referring to the reader as [...] "an ass" [...] or [...] "baby". The book contains short segments on various themes titled: [...] "Total Acceptance and Responsibility", [...] "Winners and Losers", and [...] "The Game of Life". Chapter headings include: [...] "How to Get All the Cheese in Life" [...] and [...] "How to Get <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> Want to Go in Life". Frederick {{emphasizes the importance of}} self-awareness, writing: [...] "You are the Supreme being, in Spirit". He attempts to convince the reader that life should be considered a game, and that it is more desirable to win at a goal than it is to be right about it. Frederick's thesis is that individuals cause all events which occur in their lives, and that they should work to consciously control their circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|Part IV explores its titular issue, [...] "Mind as Program". What is the self: the mind, or the body? Can they be separated? Can the {{location}} of the consciousness be separate from one's physical location. In that case, <b>where</b> are <b>you,</b> <b>really?</b> Dennett's fantastical account of being separated from his brain and David Sanford's response tackle these issues. In this section the mind is considered as software: as patterns of thought and action, as separate from the physical body housing it as a piece of software is from the machine it runs on.|$|R

60|$|It {{was against}} usage for {{students}} in the lower grades to visit the upper classes when they were at work; but Charmian contrived stolen glimpses of the still-life rooms and the rooms where they were working from the draped models. For the first time Cornelia saw the irregular hemicycle of students silently intent upon the silent forms and faces of those strange creatures who sat tranced in a lifeless immobility, as if the long practice of their trade had resolved them into something as impersonal as the innumerable pictures studied from them. She even penetrated with Charmian to the women's life-room, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> could not go while the model was posing, and where they had to time their visit {{at the moment when}} the girls had left off for lunch, and were chattering over their chocolate. They had set it out on the vacant model-stand, and they invited their visitors to break bread with them: the bread they had brought to rub out their drawings with. They made Cornelia feel as much at home with them on the summit they had reached, as she felt with the timidest beginners in the Preparatory. Charmian had reported everywhere that she had genius, {{and in the absence of}} proofs to the contrary the life-class accepted her as if she had. Their talk was not very different from the talk of the students in the lower grades. They spoke of the Synthesis, and asked her how she liked it, but they did not wait for her to say. They began to descant upon their instructors, and the pictures their instructors had last exhibited at the Academy or the American Artists; and the things that the old Synthesis pupils had there. Cornelia learned here that even actual Synthetics had things in the exhibitions, and that in the last Academy a Preparatory girl had sold a picture; she determined that before the winter was over she would at least give the Academy a chance to refuse the picture of another Preparatory girl.|$|E

Dick, H. G. Wells or whoever ... that kind of mind-bendy science-fiction <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can <b>really</b> attack themes in a new way.
