500|$|Knowles {{has always}} been {{compared}} by the media to her sister, Beyoncé, whom she considers one of her role models. She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to [...] "God Given Name": [...] "I'm not her and never will be" [...] – which was purposely set as the album's opening track to show their differences. In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence. In {{an interview with the}} Daily Mail, Knowles commented: [...] "People think there should be this great rivalry between us, but there's never been any competition. There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters." [...] Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it [...] "involves a lot of pressure". Knowles countered by saying, [...] "It's good to have her advice, but <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> different goals".|$|E
500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> a sister-brother thing going on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E

5000|$|... "When {{we started}} singing {{again in the}} 80s and the 90s, <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a good act.... We rehearsed religiously, we had our own band, we kept with the times in terms of {{technology}} and so on, with sound equipment and amplification, and <b>we</b> <b>really</b> put on a really good show." ...|$|R
2500|$|Of course, it's not {{actually}} necessary {{to exclude the}} entire line segment from z = 0 to ∞ to construct a domain in which Γ(z) is holomorphic. All <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to do is puncture the plane at a countably infinite set of points {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle {{one or more of}} the poles of Γ(z), giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. By cutting the complex plane we ensure not only that Γ(z) is holomorphic in this restricted domain– we also ensure that the contour integral of Γ over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.|$|E
2500|$|... "One" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in February 1992 as a benefit single, {{with all of}} the band's royalties being donated to different AIDS research organisations for each country in which the single {{was released}}. The group's manager Paul McGuinness commented on their decision: [...] "The band feels that [...] is the most pressing issue of the day, and <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to focus people's attention to the AIDS plague that has been with us for 10 years." [...] To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title Achtung Baby at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters. The single's liner notes explain that Wojnarowicz [...] "identifies himself and ourselves with the buffalo, pushed into the unknown by forces we cannot control or even understand".|$|E
2500|$|Shimojo {{commented that}} the balance {{checking}} basically went on until someone said [...] "Stop it, stop it, <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to launch it now". He attributes this work to why Advance Wars is so highly revered. In designing maps, he comments {{that it is impossible}} to please everyone, explaining that some people prefer maps where they start out weak and grow stronger, while others prefer to start out strong and tear through their opponent. His goal was to ensure that there were enough maps that people could say [...] "Here we go, here’s one of my maps. This is what I was waiting for". The mechanic of unlocking maps was introduced into the game as a means of getting gamers to play the game for longer. However, in an interview discussing why the feature was removed in the future title , a developer commented that it prevented people who were too busy to spend the time unlocking levels, and that there were better ways to keep players interested.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the shrill double whistle {{from the porch}} of the great house drew a dark cab to the dark portal. And then a thing {{happened}} that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> not expected. Mr Wimpole and Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh came out at the same moment.|$|R
25|$|In the meantime, the 82d Airborne Division {{arrived from}} the States on May 10 and camped near the 509th at Oujda. We were {{attached}} to them. The 82d would not buy our Scout Platoon idea, but they sure found out in a hurry after Sicily that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> something that was needed.|$|R
60|$|We were {{perfectly}} secured at Bassorah, by having frighted away the rogues, our comrades; {{and we had}} nothing to do but to consider how to convert our treasure into things proper to make us look like merchants, as we were now to be, and not like freebooters, as <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> been.|$|R
2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, I mean--I mean--my dear fellow, {{you know}} what I mean! Whether you had better do it." [...] This was the very thing I had not {{intended}} to do, for I saw how wise my wife's plan was, and how <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> nothing {{more to do with}} the matter, after having satisfied the utmost demands of humanity.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed," [...] Gervaise replied earnestly. [...] "But I {{should be}} glad, sir, {{if you will}} allow that the time should begin to count afresh from our present start. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> but {{a short period of}} service, for we wasted a week at Genoa, and ten days on our journey back here, so that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> no more than a month's active service." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} to say, mother!' said the elder girl, 'and Fraulein said {{you ought to}} know. Uncle Alwyn is come home, and Mrs. Egremont. And please, are we to call her Aunt Egremont, or Aunt Alwyn, or what?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Hershey {{later called}} the film [...] "a {{lot of fun}} even though it's terribly {{crippled}} by Roger Corman and the violence and sex. But between the actors and Marty Scorcese the director, {{we had a lot}} of fun. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> characters down but one tends to not see all that, because you end up seeing all the blood and sex." ...|$|R

6000|$|An arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff {{emerged from}} it, {{and the three}} of us sat and stared at the houses without {{speaking}} a word. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> nothing to say.

6000|$|... "Yes. That {{was what}} I {{wanted to tell}} you when I 'phoned to you to come down today. By the way, I can't realize that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> {{telephones}} in Avonlea now. It sounds so preposterously up-to-date and modernish for this darling, leisurely old place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{were better}} had we done this more early, {{for a light}} might now prove dangerous, should <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> altered the course in this intense darkness. There is no remedy, however, and the risk must be taken. I will first try the lead again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the sake}} of science, William," [...] I interrupted, laying {{a hand on his}} arm, [...] "I must beg you not to relate it. The comet will in a few minutes be behind the roof of yonder lodging house. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> no time for the story." ...|$|E

[...] - Lead guitarist Jimmy Stafford, reflecting on tensions within the band between the [...] "For Me, It's You" [...] era and their hiatus.|$|R
5000|$|One of Abbie Hoffman's {{well-known}} publicity stunts {{took place}} in 1967, when he led members of the Yippie movement to the Exchange's gallery. The provocateurs hurled fistfuls of dollars toward the trading floor below. Some traders booed, and some laughed and waved. Three months later the stock exchange enclosed the gallery with bulletproof glass. Hoffman wrote a decade later, [...] "We didn't call the press; at that time <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no notion of anything called a media event." ...|$|R
5000|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 3.0/5, stating, [...] "The show {{certainly}} did its job of making us laugh, but <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> {{high hopes for}} the finale to a great season." [...] Ariel Ponywether of FireFox gave the episode a C saying that [...] "'Judge Me Tender' is a surprisingly bland way to end the season. Not horribly offensive, it’s also not terribly funny, but it is somewhat touching. Watch this otherwise-average episode for the Marge/Homer subplot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} from what my man {{tells me that}} he did not state the case quite fairly to you.

6000|$|... "Then, Marianne," [...] said Bob, [...] "we have {{something}} to start with, at all events. There are my English Classics and English Poets, and my uniform editions of Scott and Thackeray and Macaulay and Prescott and Irving and Longfellow and Lowell and Hawthorne and Holmes and a host more. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> something pretty there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "Now, {{that is a}} basis to work upon, and we know where we stand. You can take a little rest, and let the second mate find the island.

6000|$|... "Poor Pa!" [...] said Caddy {{to me on}} {{the night}} before the great day, when <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> got things a little to rights. [...] "It seems unkind to leave him, Esther. But what could I do if I stayed! Since I first knew you, I have tidied and tidied over and over again, but it's useless.
