5|$|Bart {{talks to}} Edna after class {{and starts to}} feel worse {{about what he did}} when he is unable to console her. He tells the family <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done, and the Simpsons then write a romantically poetic and {{diplomatic}} letter to tell her how Woodrow must leave, which makes Edna feel better.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that their view of the Bible and its teachings were quite different than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the other}} {{corrections}} by later hands {{there are not}} a few instances in which the original scribe altered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> first written. The corrected form of text often agrees with codices: D, N, X, Y, Γ, Θ, Π, Φ and majority of the minuscule manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Corbally {{replaced}} William Pearson Tolley as chancellor at Syracuse and reorganized the school's administration {{structure to}} match <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> experienced at Ohio, adding a provost and multiple vice president positions {{as opposed to}} the single vice chancellor position that the university had before.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when they see it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much {{and the whole thing}} is so absolutely inconsistent with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already cabled.|$|E
5|$|Oda {{revealed}} that he originally planned One Piece to last five years, {{and that he had}} already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected. Oda stated that the ending would be <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{very good}} to me. If you knew it all,--if you could {{understand}} how good <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been! I'll try and tell you some day. It is not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done that makes me love him so,--but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> thoroughly understood, and <b>what,</b> so understanding, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not done, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not said. It {{is a case of}} sympathy. If ever there was a gentleman uncle Christopher is one. And I used to dislike him so, at one time!" ...|$|R
50|$|His finest tribute though {{comes from}} Hubert Howe Bancroft's who renders this, It were well {{to judge a}} man not alone by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> accomplished, but also by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> conscientiously tried to perform.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am mindful. What is it? Do {{you intend}} telling me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been to you. Let {{me say that}} it is useless. He is a man, as you and I are women." ...|$|R
5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.|$|E
5|$|Abra {{arrived back}} in Holby {{towards the end}} of series 8, {{immediately}} becoming embroiled in an illegal porcine kidney transplantation on renal patient Pete Golding. When Ric discovered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done, the deception strained their friendship, and Abra came close to losing his job. Eventually, Ric decided the pressure of covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Christy {{accepted}} an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at {{a salary of}} $5,000 per annum, twice <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing {{was hard to find}} in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{can look}} into a man's heart and judge all {{the sources of}} his actions? There are mixed {{feelings}} there, no doubt. Remorse for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done; regret for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> lost;--something, perhaps, of the purity of love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did the {{pin prick}} you? I'll catch the little rogue, and hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{to say for}} himself. Ah, here he is--I've caught him! I'll hold him fast. Lie still in my lap, and we will hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to say.|$|R
50|$|Greenberg <b>has</b> said <b>he</b> {{hears the}} music {{performed}} inside his head, like many composers, and often several musical pieces simultaneously, {{and he is}} then able to simply notate <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> listened to, and rarely needs to make corrections to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> notated.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} pantomime Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E
5|$|Danzig was saved, but {{the next}} year the {{strengthened}} in the Ducal Prussia Swedish army took Brodnica, and early in 1629 defeated the Polish units at Górzno. Gustavus Adolphus from his Baltic coast position laid an economic siege against the Commonwealth and ravaged <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> conquered. At this point allied forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein were brought in {{to help keep the}} Swedes in check. Forced by the combined Polish-Austrian action Gustavus had to withdraw from Kwidzyn to Malbork, in process being defeated and almost taken prisoner by Koniecpolski at the Battle of Trzciana.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E

5|$|Four {{months after}} the birth of the child and just days before {{deployment}} to Iraq, Brown was served with notice of the proposed adoption. Brown signed the document, believing that he was relinquishing rights to Maldonado. Brown, once he realized <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> signed, immediately tried to retrieve the document, and after that failed, contacted the Judge Advocate General at Fort Sill for assistance. Seven days after being notified of the proposed adoption by the Capobiancos, Brown obtained a stay of the adoption proceedings under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and he deployed with his Army unit to Iraq.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, {{followed}} Baden-Powell's {{struggle to}} hold Mafeking, {{and when the}} siege was broken, {{he had become a}} national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting and wilderness survival, Aids to Scouting, that owed much to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned from discussions with Burnham.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E
5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he {{would go back to}} sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
