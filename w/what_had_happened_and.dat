5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, {{as he did}} {{not explain}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> {{that the only way}} to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) {{immediately}} arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E
5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet {{to one of his}} bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{initiated}} {{an offensive}} into East Prussia in October 1944, {{but it was}} temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes {{had taken place in}} East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.|$|E

5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> shook his head.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff.

There he was met by Mablung of Doriath, who confirmed the words of Brandir were true. In despair and shame Túrin fled back to Cabed-en-Aras and cast himself upon the point of his sword Gurthang.|$|E

25|$|The {{developing}} scandal led to inquiries into {{practices at}} the BBC and the National Health Service. It was alleged that rumours of Savile's activities had circulated at the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, but no action had been taken. The Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised for <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> on 16 October 2012 appointed former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith {{to review the}} culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there, and Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, was appointed to look at why the Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission in December 2011.|$|E

25|$|While much of {{the live}} Montreal {{audience}} immediately understood <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> responded angrily, television viewers had been left largely confused as Jim Ross promptly wrapped up the event on commentary and Survivor Series went off the air four minutes ahead of schedule with the parting image of Michaels holding the belt aloft as he disappeared backstage. Rumors and expressions of surprise and shock pervaded the Internet almost immediately after the match ended. Some observers considered it a creative and all-time great match finish. Observers of professional wrestling speculated whether the entire episode would result in WCW becoming the dominant brand in Canada, where {{a large majority of}} fans had remained loyal to WWF, especially as the Hart family was working with the company.|$|E
25|$|The French cycling union, the Union Vélocipédique Française, {{heard from}} dozens of {{competitors}} and witnesses and in December disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers: Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Hippolyte Aucouturier. The UVF did not say precisely <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> the details were lost when Tour archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and never seen again. Stories spread of riders spreading tacks {{on the road to}} delay rivals with punctures, of riders being poisoned by each other or by rival fans. Lucien Petit-Breton said he complained to an official that he had seen a rival hanging on to a motorcycle, only to have the cheating rider pull out a revolver.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October, the Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised for <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> said further {{internal}} investigations {{would take}} place.

As {{a result of the}} shelving of the Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities (see above), there were complaints on Newswatch. On 11 October 2012, the Director-General asked BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie to look into staff concerns over the dropping of the item. He announced a review of BBC policy on child protection, and an enquiry into its culture and practices, focusing on the years Savile worked there.|$|E
