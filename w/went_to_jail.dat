5|$|Chapman {{purchased}} land in Portland from Stephen Coffin and Daniel H. Lownsdale in 1850, {{which he}} then cleared {{and built a}} home. This is now {{the site of the}} Multnomah County Courthouse. In Portland, he was a promoter of the city and helped to get Canyon Road built to ensure the city would become the commercial center of Oregon. Chapman practiced law, and in October 1851 he was held in contempt of court by Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt. Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred, but never <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> and the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson. Chapman had accused Pratt of mistreating lawyers in an affidavit.|$|E

25|$|Burton {{was born}} in Indianapolis, the son of Bonnie L. (née Hardesty) and Charles W. Burton. His father, a former policeman, was abusive to his mother, and never held a job for very long. The family moved constantly, living in trailer parks, cabins, and motels. In June 1950, some years after the couple divorced, his mother {{went to the police}} and got a {{restraining}} order against his father. He responded by kidnapping Burton's mother. Burton and his younger brother and sister were briefly sent to the Marion County Children's Guardian Home. After his mother escaped, Burton's father <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> for two years. Burton's mother remarried, and Burton and his younger brother and sister had happier teenage years.|$|E
25|$|The IWW first {{attracted}} {{attention in}} Goldfield, Nevada in 1906 {{and during the}} Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. The town of Spokane, Washington had outlawed street meetings, and arrested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a Wobbly organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, {{large numbers of people}} descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town. In Spokane, over 500 people <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> and four people died. The tactic of fighting for free speech to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in Fresno, Aberdeen, and other locations. In San Diego, although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen mounted a particularly brutal counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Wuornos hitchhiked to Florida, {{where she}} met 69-year-old yacht club {{president}} Lewis Gratz Fell. They married that same year, and the announcement of their nuptials was printed in the local newspaper's society pages. However, Wuornos continually involved herself in confrontations at their local bar and eventually <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> for assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading {{him to get a}} restraining order against her. She returned to Michigan where, on July 14, 1976, she was arrested in Antrim County and charged with assault and disturbing the peace for throwing a cue ball at a bartender's head. On July 17, her brother Keith died of esophageal cancer and Wuornos received $10,000 from his life insurance. Wuornos and Fell annulled their marriage on July 21 after only nine weeks. In August 1976, Wuornos was given a $105 fine for drunk driving. She used Keith's inheritance money to pay the fine and spent the rest within two months by using it to buy luxuries including a new car, which she wrecked shortly afterwards.|$|E

[...] Darden had been married to Sheryl from 1972–1977 when they divorced. [...] He had previously been $5000 in arrears until being briefly jailed {{for failure to}} pay and cursing the judge.

Foxx contributed to his character's appearance, suggesting full-scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style. Foxx described the appearance as [...] "a guy who maybe <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> for a minute and now he's living in his own time capsule.

Keating <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> when he could not post a $5 million bond. He was convicted in December 1991 of 17 counts of fraud, racketeering, and conspiracy. Mother Teresa {{asked the court to}} show leniency to Keating, in recognition of the considerable sums he had donated to her charitable operations. In April 1992, California Superior Court Judge Lance Ito gave Keating the maximum 10-year prison sentence, quoting Woody Guthrie, to wit [...] "More people have suffered from the point of a fountain pen than from a gun." [...] Keating was sent to the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution, Tucson to serve his time.|$|E

500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} hear from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Henry asks Emma {{about his}} father. Emma tells Henry that {{his dad was}} a trainee fireman who used to {{frequent}} the diner where she worked. The two of them [...] "hung out" [...] a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry before she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail.</b> Once there, she tried {{to tell him about}} Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should never know the truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he said no one else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E
500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail.</b> He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, she caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] and told her to quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.|$|E
