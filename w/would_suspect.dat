5|$|Raju and his team, now {{disguised}} as Sabarimala pilgrims, rent a van {{hoping to catch}} Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is {{waiting for him in}} the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E

25|$|Christie {{adapted the}} book as a play {{of the same name}} in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only {{eliminating}} Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a natural child) of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 2006, law {{enforcement}} officials said that blood spatter {{had been found in}} Hans Reiser's house and car. Forensic testing (including DNA analysis) could neither confirm nor rule out Nina Reiser as the source of the blood. Officials had not located the missing passenger seat of his car. They also indicated that they had found in the car two books on homicide investigation purchased by Reiser on September 8 — five days after his wife's disappearance: , by David Simon, and Masterpieces of Murder, by Jonathan Goodman. Daniel Horowitz, a high-profile defense attorney, joined the defense team but dropped the case on November 28, citing Reiser's inability to pay for his services. Namesys's employees stated that Reiser felt the police <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> him from the start. Reiser was arraigned on Thursday, October 12, where he delayed entering a plea until his next court appearance on November 28. He was held without bail. On November 28, Reiser entered a not guilty plea and invoked his right to a speedy trial, forcing the state to schedule a preliminary hearing for December 11.|$|E

500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little guy! Who <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a pain in her ass." [...] Shari Elliker, a WBAL (AM) disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut (guest star season 2, main cast season 3–5: part 1)– {{works for}} Gus as an {{all-purpose}} cleaner and hitman, and also works for Saul {{as a private}} investigator. The character of Mike {{has been compared to}} Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction, which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: [...] "I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain't my cleaner. But throughout this world, you <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> there had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2012 a 1921 50 {{cents in}} MS-65 {{condition}} {{is valued at}} $250,000 to $350,000. [...] Despite a mintage of 206,398 coins, {{there was a very}} low demand for 50-cent coins in the 1920s. The belief {{is that most of the}} 50-cent coins from 1920 and 1921 were melted (amounting to approximately 480,392 coins). [...] The reason for the melting was that new coins were needed for 1929 and if coins from 1920 and 1921 were released into circulation, people <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> counterfeit coins. According to legend, only 50 of these coins still exist (with only 3 known in mint state), and most of those are from Specimen Sets that were sold to people who visited the RC Mint.|$|E
