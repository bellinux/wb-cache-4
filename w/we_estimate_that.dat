2500|$|Hipparchus could confirm his {{computations}} {{by comparing}} eclipses {{from his own}} time (presumably 27 January 141 and 26 November 139 according to [...] ), with eclipses from Babylonian records 345 years earlier (Almagest IV.2; [...] ). Already al-Biruni (Qanun VII.2.II) and Copernicus (de revolutionibus IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is actually about 5 minutes longer than the value for the eclipse period that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus. However, the timing methods of the Babylonians had an error of no less than 8 minutes. [...] Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the eclipse period to the nearest hour, {{and used it to}} confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than try to derive an improved value from his own observations. From modern ephemerides and taking account of the change in the length of the day (see ΔT) <b>we</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the error in the assumed length of the synodic month was less than 0.2 seconds in the 4th century and less than 0.1 seconds in Hipparchus's time.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{session of}} the General Assembly passed a bill {{exempting}} certain veterans' organizations from the registration and reporting requirements that apply to most charities that solicit donations in Virginia. The bill was introduced {{at the request of}} Bobby Thompson, director of the U.S. Navy Veterans Association (USNVA), who made large contributions to certain Republican candidates. After the bill passed both the House and Senate, newspaper accounts of that charity's questionable practices caused a sponsor of the bill to request McDonnell to veto it, but he signed the bill into law anyway. As a result, the organization, which was under investigation in New Mexico (which barred the USNVA before the Virginia bill was signed), Florida, and Missouri, as well as other non-profit veterans' organizations, did not have to report to Virginia on how they spend the donations that they receive. McDonnell later donated to charity the $5,000 campaign contribution that he had received from Thompson. In August 2010, Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray announced that a nationwide arrest warrant had been issued for Thompson, who had stolen the identity and Social Security number of a victim who was not connected to the USNVA. Corday stated, [...] "We know he bilked Ohioans out of at least $1.9 million, and <b>we</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> nationally he collected at least $20 million." ...|$|E

For instance, when we praise our Revolution of 1688, though the nation in that act was on the defensive, and was justified in incurring all the evils of a defensive war, we do not rest there. We always combine with the {{subversion of}} the old government the happy settlement which followed.
