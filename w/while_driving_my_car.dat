5000|$|... "Violently Happy" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In particular, Simon Reynolds of The New York Times praised the song generally [...] "The title of “Violently Happy” captures the Björk effect perfectly : a gush and rush of euphoria, {{a tidal wave}} of oceanic feeling. Over the song’s brisk house beats, Björk stammers as she struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin : “I’m <b>driving</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> too fast with ecstatic music on/ I’m daring people to jump off roofs with me.” In the end, she and Mr. Hooper resort to studio wizardry to gesture at inexpressible feelings, sampling one syllable and turning it into a stuttering vocal tic". The Daily Telegraph's journalist Emily Bearn noticed that [...] "Violently Happy" [...] finds her making guttural noises at the sea : [...] "I tip-toe down to the shore/Stand by the ocean/Make it roar at me/And I roar back".|$|R
5000|$|In {{recording}} {{their fifth}} studio album, White Crosses, Against Me! also recorded acoustic versions of songs written for recording the album. In {{a press release}} on their website, Against Me! announced the single for release following their European tour, [...] "to tide UK fans over until the band return for their headline shows with Fucked Up, Japanese Voyeurs and Crazy Arm in November," [...] with an acoustic version of the song. In interviews, Grace has explained {{the meaning of the}} song: [...] "I wrote the majority of the record in St Augustine, in Florida where I recently moved to and just around the corner from my house there's this church and the front lawn is covered in these little white crosses, and behind them there's a piece of text saying each of the crosses is there to represent how many abortions occur in America every day. So the song is in essence a pro-choice song, and seeing those crosses everyday, I fantasised about smashing them down, or <b>driving</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> through them. I think there's {{something to be said for}} acts like that - it'd be very gratifying, but instead I play music and write about this stuff. That's why I say in the lyric, [...] "I wanna smash them all".|$|R

40|$|I {{thought if}} {{in-vehicle}} interaction were as easy and spontaneous as our language, it would ensure safe driving. Through this research, I found drivers preferred gestural language to voice language when the control was simple and repetitive. This study investigates gestural interaction of secondary in-vehicle tasks <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> I researched functions that were most distractive to drivers and applied those {{to my new}} interaction. According to Paul Green, the most distractive in-vehicle interaction was audio and climate controls. Based on this research, I then applied audio and climate controls gestures as input for the interactions. The best eyes and hands position <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> was 2 ̆ 2 Eyes {{on the road and}} Hands on the wheel. 2 ̆ 2 I installed two touch pads on the wheel to recognize gestures because it satisfied the 2 ̆ 2 Hands on the wheel 2 ̆ 2 gesture.

40|$|This work is {{a product}} {{development}} of a product which facilitates enduro drivers swallowing fluid <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> <b>My</b> own experience {{of the problem and}} a custom survey gave me some frames and requirements of how such a product would look. To obtain the different concepts the method of brainstorming was used where I outlined the various proposals. The basic concept was that some kind of pump would build pressure in the liquid and when the user opens the nozzle the liquid will come out without the need to use the mouth to suck. The screening phase consisted of two steps. The first step, a Pugh matrix where I varied reference concepts and four of the six proposals were eliminated. During the second screening phase, two test models were built and I tried out which one I would eliminate. The concept that was left was a simple pump, powered by a battery of 9 -volt. The pump starts when the user opens the nozzle and stops automatically when the nozzle is closed.   This is controlled by a hose which swells when the pump is running and the nozzle is closed. Then the hose begins to swell and affects a small micro switch that breaks the voltage supply to the pump. A check valve makes sure that the liquid remains in the hose and the pump will remain neutral until the re-opening of the nozzle and the hose shrinks. ...|$|R

The statement was as follows: On July 18, 1969, at approximately 11:15 p.m. in Chappaquiddick, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, I was <b>driving</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> on Main Street on my way to get the ferry back to Edgartown. I was unfamiliar with the road and turned right onto Dike Road, instead of bearing hard left on Main Street. After proceeding for approximately one-half mile m on Dike Road I descended a hill and came upon a narrow bridge. The car went {{off the side of the}} bridge. There was one passenger with me, one Miss Mary Kopechne, a former secretary of my brother Sen. Robert Kennedy. The car turned over and sank into the water and landed with the roof resting on the bottom. I attempted to open the door and the window of the car but have no recollection of how I got out of the car. I came to the surface and then repeatedly dove down to the car in an attempt to see if the passenger was still in the car. I was unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock. I recall walking back to where my friends were eating. There was a car parked in front of the cottage and I climbed into the backseat. I then asked for someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a period and then going back to my hotel room. When I fully realized what had happened this morning, I immediately contacted the police.|$|R

40|$|Smart {{devices and}} {{internet}} connectivity {{have become part}} of our everyday lives. As a result, there has been an increase in drivers accessing social media and apps behind the steering wheel, and mobile devices are often portrayed as unwanted distractions. Regardless of punitive strategies such as fines and demerit points, drivers will continue to bring their own devices and use them within the car. I explore how these technologies can be re­-contextualised as tools in individual mobility rather than road safety threats. Specifically, I critically analyse the challenges and opportunities in the design of apps to alleviate driver boredom and re­engage drivers during periods of under­stimulation. The concept involves the use of real­time data, location­based services, ambient interface design, and gamification to provide safe stimuli <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> <b>My</b> data indicates that driver boredom is most likely to occur in low­stimulation conditions such as routine drives, speed maintaining, or low traffic. This uncomfortable state may then trigger the seeking of distractions (e. g. phone use), which in turn can lead to accidents. Intervening {{in such a way that}} it makes low­-stimulation driving more engaging and less boring could have safety and user experience benefits. Semi­automated driving further amplifies the significance of this work. A cutback in manual control is likely to cause boredom states more often, yet requires drivers to remain vigilant and take over control at any time. To date, boredom and under­-stimulation have not received much attention in the automotive user interfaces and road safety research communities, where the emphasis has been on cognitive load and distraction. My work aims to explore this knowledge gap. I use a user­centred design approach to address the question: How can we leverage mobile and wearable devices to re­engage drivers in the driving task? I argue that these devices can be used for 1) sensing vehicle and driver data, and 2) as platforms for engaging apps to reduce unsafe distractions and boredom. As part of this endeavour, I explore ambient interface design and gamification as ways to provide real­time driving feedback and engage users in the driving task. Applying user­-centred design and reframing distraction as engagement is a new and provocative approach. Insights gained from this research study will deepen our understanding of driver engagement, which is as relevant to manual driving as it is to semi­automated mobility...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy <b>driving</b> <b>my</b> gold <b>car</b> {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|R

40|$|Background—The risk of syncope {{occurring}} <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> has obvious {{implications for}} personal and public safety. We aimed {{to define the}} clinical characteristics, causes, and prognosis of syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Methods and Results—In this case-control study of consecutive patients evaluated for syncope from 1996 through 1998 at an academic medical center, we documented causes, clinical characteristics, and recurrence of syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> Of 3877 patients identified, 381 (9. 8 %) had syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> (driving group). Compared with the 3496 patients (90. 2 %) {{who did not have}} syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving,</b> the driving group was younger (P 0. 01) and had higher percentages of male patients (P 0. 001) and patients with a history of any cardiovascular disease (P 0. 01) and stroke (P 0. 02). Syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> was commonly caused by neurally mediated syncope (37. 3 %) and cardiac arrhythmias (11. 8 %). Long-term survival in the driving group was comparable to that of an age- and sex-matched cohort from the Minnesota population (P 0. 15). Among the driving group, syncope recurred in 72 patients, 35 of whom (48. 6 %) had recurrence 6 months after the initial evaluation. Recurrences during driving happened in 10 patients in the driving group, 7 of which (70 %) were 12 months after the initial evaluation. Conclusions—In our study, neurally mediated syncope was {{the most common type of}} syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving.</b> The causes of syncope, the late recurrences of syncope (during 6 months of follow-up), and the overall low incidence of recurrent syncope <b>while</b> <b>driving</b> provide useful information to supplement current recommendations on drivin...|$|R
