5|$|The {{character}} has been criticised by police detectives <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Marsden's habit of discussing investigation details with suspects (as her colleagues accepted bribes) did not properly represent their profession. In response, the BBC {{said it had}} sought advice from a police consultant for storylines involving Marsden.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{provoked}} {{opposition from}} park users <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> any {{reduction in the}} area of the park was not acceptable. 'Surprised by the extent of feeling', Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans. Campaigners then applied to have 'Town Green' status applied to the park, but this was declined in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Burebista {{may only}} have outlived Caesar {{for a short}} time. In the same year he was assassinated in a plot by the Dacian aristocracy, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> a {{centralized}} state reduced their privileges. After his death, the Dacian kingdom dissolved, {{with the exception of}} the nucleus around the Orăştie Mountains, while the rest became various smaller kingdoms. After Burebista's death the kingdom was divided into four parts ruled by the religious elite. By the time of Augustus Dacia broke further down into five parts.|$|E
5|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con, it was {{announced}} that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa, had been arranged and made into a storyboard. However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it resolved Ursa's disappearance in an unsatisfactory way and that wasn't the way the story should be told.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, then a Hauptmann (Captain), {{arrived at}} Wevelgem on 11 January 1943 {{to take over}} command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG26—26th Fighter Wing) from Major Josef Priller.

5|$|In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the {{daughter}} of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike other}} {{countries}} during {{the evolution of}} their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> working-class families had no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen {{and one or two}} rooms.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{identified}} {{a number of}} reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have felt that they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord, I {{must call}} for help," [...] said the {{trembling}} caitiff, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> at <b>that</b> moment all {{the bitterness of}} the mortal agony--"It was the law's act, not mine. What could I do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the second}} week in a row on Youre Fired!, two of the {{panellist}}s agreed with Lord Sugars decision. The one panellist <b>who</b> disagreed, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Tom should have been fired instead.|$|R

5|$|Revelation is {{the ninth}} studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day, {{released}} on July 29, 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Howard Benson, who had decided {{to work with the}} band after rock singer Chris Daughtry drew attention to lead singer Mac Powell's vocal ability. Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson, Third Day achieved a positive working relationship with Benson, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> their different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record.|$|E
5|$|The Muppets' Wizard of Oz premiered on April 27, 2005 at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's {{television}} premiere {{was broadcast}} on ABC on May 20, 2005, {{as the final}} ABC Movie of the Week. The film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the film was too mature for young audiences and that the cameo scenes and popular culture references were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Viva el Príncipe {{received}} a positive review from David Jeffries of Allmusic praising Botija's production and Castro's vocal delivery. It earned a negative review from {{an editor of}} Terra Networks <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the album did not add anything to the originals. The album {{received a}} nomination for a Latin Grammy, two Billboard Latin Music Awards nominations, and an Oye! award. The success led to a 2011 release of more José José songs titled Mi Amigo El Príncipe.|$|E
6000|$|AS {{the great}} steamer swung round {{into the stream}} the cloud of white {{handkerchiefs}} waving on the wharf melted away, the last good-byes grew fainter, and those who went and those <b>who</b> stayed <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the parting was over,-- ...|$|R

5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
60|$|Near that brick grave {{there was}} a tomb erected, very soon after the flood, for two bodies that were found in close embrace; and it was visited at {{different}} moments by two men <b>who</b> both <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there.|$|R

5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot from New England <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E

50|$|Historians {{are unsure}} {{at what point}} wrestling changed from {{competitive}} catch wrestling into worked entertainment. Those <b>who</b> participated <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> maintenance of a constant and complete illusion for all who were not involved was necessary to keep audience interest. For decades, wrestlers lived their public lives {{as though they were}} their characters.|$|R
