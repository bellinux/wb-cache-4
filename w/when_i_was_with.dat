2500|$|Dreyer was ideologically {{conservative}}. According to David Bordwell, [...] "As a youth {{he belonged}} to the Social Liberal party, a conservative group radical only in their opposition to military expenditures...'Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> Ekstrabladet,' Dreyer recalled, 'I was conservative...I don't believe in revolutions. They have, as a rule, the tedious quality of pulling development back. I believe more in evolution, in the small advances.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{couple was}} {{strongly}} criticized for the relationship, and Wrangler {{was accused of}} [...] "turning straight" [...] and entering the relationship simply for money. However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. [...] "I'm not bisexual and I'm not straight", Wrangler later said. [...] "I'm gay, but I could never live a gay lifestyle, because I'm much too competitive. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> a guy I would {{always want to be}} better than him: what we were accomplishing, what we were wearing—anything. With a woman you compete like crazy, but coming from different points of view, and as far as I'm concerned, that was doable." ...|$|E

And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of the}} community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, and I remembered the stranger, beggared and straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, and I realised that God Most High would ask me about all of them, and I (Umar) would testify about them, and I feared that I should find no excuse <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|E
2500|$|After 1995 Hussein became {{increasingly}} critical of Saddam's rule in Iraq. On 4November 1995 Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, who aimed to undermine Rabin's peace efforts with the Palestinians. Due to the close relationship forged with Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein {{was invited to}} give a speech during Rabin's funeral. The funeral, held in Jerusalem, was the first time Hussein had been in Jerusalem since 1967. Hussein drew parallels between Rabin's assassination and his grandfather's assassination in 1951: [...] "We are not ashamed, nor are we afraid, nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell, as did my grandfather in this city <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> him and but a boy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E
