5|$|The {{events leading}} up the {{stand-off}} between NATO and the Warsaw Pact are detailed in a pre-game text; Iran declares <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> and subsequently invades the latter nation, whilst Egypt succumbs to a civil war and establishes Islamic law over the country, culminating in an Egyptian invasion of Israel. The events in the Middle East prompt the superpowers of the United States and the British Empire to intervene, leading up to a conventional war in Europe against the Eastern bloc. The game is set in 1989.|$|E

50|$|Taking into {{consideration}} {{the results of the}} 1991 and 2003 <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the 1999 <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the former Yugoslavia, the Israeli air force was unable to accomplish its objectives as completely. This partly results from the military doctrine that Hezbollah used in the war which proved effective. There have also been reports during the conflict that a Hezbollah-operated flying drone penetrated Israeli airspace, and returned to Lebanese territory.|$|R

The candidates also presented different opinions on contentious issues such as abortion and stem-cell research but were united in calling for further tax cuts. All candidates opposed a pullout from Iraq except for Ron Paul, who spoke and voted against the resolution to authorize <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2002 {{and has been a}} vocal critic of the war.|$|E

25|$|For the reconstruction, {{contracts}} {{were awarded}} to private companies. Initially companies from countries that had {{opposed the war}} were excluded from these contracts, but this decision was reversed due to protests. Political activists and commentators allege that The Pentagon favoured companies like Halliburton, former employer of Vice President Dick Cheney, because they had connections to high-ranking members of the Bush administration. This suspicion had already been a concern during the global protests against the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq.</b> An audit found that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) may have overcharged the U.S. government $61million, on contracts worth billions, for bringing oil products for the U.S. army into Iraq via a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co.|$|E

In 1991, playwright Neil Simon, director Gene Saks and the cast of the play Lost in Yonkers held the opening night after-party on January 17 at Old Ebbitt Grill. Just minutes before the curtain rose on the Washington debut of the play, the cast learned that the United States had declared <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> and begun the Gulf War.

25|$|During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the {{official}} government policy in East Germany, and dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti-Americanism was the common {{position on the}} left, but the majority praised America as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation. After reunification in 1990, the Communist Party in the East struggled on under a new name, 'Die Linke", and maintained its old anti-American position. Today it warns that America is plotting to spoil Germany's friendly relationship with Russia. Germany's refusal to support the American <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003 was often seen {{as a manifestation of}} anti-Americanism. Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but reemerged in the 21st century especially in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Merkel.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the International Affairs journal, Michael T. Boyle of the Australian National University {{reviewed}} Hegemony or Survival alongside Immanuel Wallerstein's The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World (2003), considering both to be [...] "well-considered if imperfect arguments" [...] {{that the}} Bush administration's foreign policy was {{in keeping with}} a long history of U.S. interference in global affairs. Praising its [...] "prescient" [...] appearance and its analysis of the historical evidence, Boyle did present some criticism of the book. In stressing the Bush administration's continuity with earlier presidencies, Boyle argued that Chomsky had neglected to highlight the differences between the Bush administration and its predecessors, in particular its willingness to break relationships with long-standing allies. Furthermore, Boyle opined that Chomsky had failed to offer a [...] "compelling explanation" [...] for why the U.S. government was willing to declare <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003, a conflict that was far costlier and riskier than the 1980s military adventures in Nicaragua and Grenada.|$|E

When she returned to Vienna in 1985, she worked up the time of the Nazi regime and the Holocaust. During Kurt Waldheim's election campaign in 1987/88, she made a series of paintings and collages, in which she incorporated Nazi propaganda texts.

2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>Iraq,</b> {{the lack of}} democratisation in Arab countries, {{and the war on}} terror's negative effects on freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|E

40|$|PublisherTokyoThis paper {{explores the}} Church of England's recent {{views in the}} area of war and defence, drawing {{attention}} to its just war thinking recently revived by several theologians and churchmen. As a national established church, the Church of England has developed its own approach to modern warfare to meet the political circumstances of the day, on the one hand, and to place strong moral limits on the use of force, on the other. The paper attempts to review several uses of just war theory within Anglicanism in the contexts of the Second World War, nuclear deterrence in the Cold War, humanitarian intervention, the 'war on terrorism' and the <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> <b>On</b> <b>Iraq's</b> case, the paper reflects on arguments by Dr Rowan Williams, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard Harries, the former Bishop of Oxford and the Church's leading expert <b>on</b> just <b>war</b> theory, who both criticised the war in Iraq as unjust. Through this, I ask how the Church's changing attitude towards warfare highlights another unsettled question, namely the relationship between church and state in Britain, and, given the Church's moral concern, whether it benefits from being an Established church...|$|R
