Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra {{covered a}} speech by Jaffe on the {{development}} of God of War at the 2006 D.I.C.E. Summit in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said [...] "God of War was a rare opportunity for a game designer" [...] because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game [...] "out of passion, not fear, {{and that it would be}} a game that [...] himself, as a game player, would want to play". Jaffe said the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark also inspired the development of God of War; he wanted to make players feel like he felt as a child watching that film, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> player in the role of an adventurer, referencing The Legend of Zelda games. He elaborated that God of War was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game [...] "is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and [...] "it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next". He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment—but [...] " [...] was going to get bored" [...] if they did not step outside of those boundaries.|$|E

It's a lot of fun to see them do this, and Rectus and I had already chucked a good deal of small change into the harbor, and had seen it come up again, some of it before it got to the bottom.

6000|$|I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> case clearly before you, and I will {{therefore}} {{show you what}} I mean by another familiar example. I will suppose that one of you, on coming down {{in the morning to}} the parlor of your house, finds that a tea-pot and some spoons which had been left in the room on the previous evening are gone,--the window is open, and you observe the mark of a dirty hand on the window-frame, and perhaps, in addition to that, you notice the impress of a hob-nailed shoe on the gravel outside. All these phenomena have struck your attention instantly, and before two seconds have passed you say, [...] "Oh, somebody has broken open the window, entered the room, and run off with the spoons and the tea-pot!" [...] That speech is out of your mouth in a moment. And you will probably add, [...] "I know there has; I am quite sure of it!" [...] You mean to say exactly what you know; but in reality you are giving expression to what is, in all essential particulars, an hypothesis. You do not KNOW it at all; it is nothing but an hypothesis rapidly framed in your own mind. And it is an hypothesis founded on a long train of inductions and deductions.|$|E
60|$|Now let us {{change the}} example a little further. Suppose that the {{monopolist}} has for sale {{not simply a}} fixed and definite quantity of a certain article, but something which he can produce in larger quantities as desired. At what price will he now sell? If he offers the article {{at a very high}} price only a few people will take it: if he lowers the price there will be more and more purchasers. His interest seems divided. He will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> price as high as possible so that the profit on each single article (over what it costs him to produce it) will be as great as possible. But he will also want to make as many sales as he possibly can, which will induce him to set the price low enough to bring in new buyers. But, of course, if he puts the price so low that it only covers the cost of making the goods his profit is all gone and the mere multiplicity of sales is no good to him. He must try therefore to find a point of maximum profit where, having in view both the number of sales and the profit over cost on each sale the net profit is at its greatest. This gives us the fundamental law of monopoly price. It is to be noted that under modern conditions of production the cost of manufacture per article decreases to a great extent in proportion as a larger and larger number is produced and thus the widening of the sale lowers the proportionate cost. In any particular case, therefore, it may turn out that the price that suits the monopolist's own interest is quite a low price, one such as to allow for an enormous quantity of sales and a very low cost of manufacture. This, we say, may be the case. But it is not so of necessity. In and of itself the monopoly price corresponds to the monopolist's profit and not to cheapness of sale. The price may be set far above the cost.|$|E
6000|$|The captain gave {{a kind of}} sobbing laugh, {{and went}} on in a lower tone. [...] "Well, I know you ain't going back. I guess I didn't expect it much from the start, and I guess I'm not surprised." [...] Then {{he lifted his head}} and shouted, [...] "And do you suppose I want to go back? Don't you suppose I would like {{to spend the rest of}} my days, too, among white people, people that use each other white, as you say, and where there ain't any want or, what's worse, fear of want? Men! There ain't a day, or an hour, or a minute, when I don't think how awful it is over there, where I got to be either some man's slave or some man's master, as much so as if it was down in the ship's articles. My wife ain't so, because she ain't been ashore here. I wouldn't let her; I was afraid to let her see what a white man's country really was, because I felt so weak about it myself, and I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> trial on her, too. And do you know why we're going back, or want to go? I guess some of you know, but I want to tell these folks here so they'll understand, and I want you, Mr. Homos," [...] he called to my husband, [...] "to get it down straight. It's because we've got two little {{children}} over there, that we left with their grandmother when my wife come with me this voyage because she had lung difficulty and wanted to see whether she could get her health back. Nothing else on God's green earth could take me back to America, and I guess it couldn't my wife if she knew what Altruria was as well as I do. But when I went around here and saw how everything was, and remembered how it was at home, I just said, 'She'll stay on the ship.' Now, that's all I got to say, though I thought I had a lot more. I guess it'll be enough for these folks, and they can judge between us." [...] Then the captain sat down, and to make a long story short, the facts of the hearing were repeated in Altrurian the next day by megaphone, and when the translation was finished there was a general rush for the captain. He plainly expected to be lynched, and his wife screamed out, [...] "Oh, don't hurt him! He isn't a bad man!" [...] But it was only the Altrurian way with a guilty person: they wanted to let him know how sorry they were for him, and since his sin had found him out how hopeful they were for his redemption. I had to explain it to the sailors as well as to the captain and his wife, but I don't believe any of them quite accepted the fact.|$|E
