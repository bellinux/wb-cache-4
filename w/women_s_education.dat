40|$|Many key {{development}} outcomes {{depend on}} women s ability to negotiate favorable intra-household allocations of resources. Yet {{it has been}} difficult to clearly identify which poli-cies can increase women’s bargaining power and result in better outcomes. This paper reviews both the analytical frameworks and the empirical evidence on the importance of women’s bargaining power. It argues that there is sufficient evidence from rigorous studies to conclude that women’s bargaining power does affect outcomes. But in many specific instances, the quantitative evidence cannot rigorously identify causality. In these cases, a combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence may suggest policy levers. Taken together, there are sufficient data in place to support a greatly expanded focus on intrahousehold outcomes and bargaining power. Additional data at the individual level will allow for further and more detailed research. A growing literature supports the current conventional wisdom – namely, that the patterns of evidence suggest that <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>education,</b> incomes, and assets all are important aspects of women s bargain-ing power. JEL codes: 012, 020, R 2 Over the past several decades, development policy makers have grown increasing-ly {{aware of the importance of}} gender issues to development effectiveness. One of the central messages from research on gender is that many key development out-comes seem to depend on women’s ability to negotiate favorable intrahousehold allocations of resources. The development literature suggests that women’s bar-gaining power within households is linked to variables such as the health and ed-ucation of children and the general well-being of women and girls. In addition, women’s bargaining power may affect many aspects of household production, in-cluding the allocation of labor to activities such as housework, agricultural work, and wage work.

40|$|Introduction: Satisfaction from marital {{relation}} is {{a fundamental}} factor in stability and maintenance of marital bond. Sexual satisfaction {{is one of the}} effective factors in spouse relation satisfaction. Materials and Methods: This research is a correlation study. A sample of 400 women referring to health care centers in Arak city was selected randomly in 2003. The information collecting tools were questionnaires. To analyze the data, the descriptive statistical, frequency distribution charts, the mean and central tendency as well as inferential statistics (2 test and Kruskal Wallis) have been applied. Results: According to the results, there was a meaningful relationship between having orgasm and sexual relation satisfaction, nonsexual relation satisfaction with spouse and marital relation satisfaction. Also, there was a meaningful statistical relationship between orgasm experience and variables of age, spouse <b>s</b> age, <b>education,</b> spouse <b>s</b> <b>education,</b> duration of marriage, number of children, and family s income. Conclusion: There is a relationship between <b>women</b> <b>s</b> orgasm experience and the amount of satisfaction from marital relation.

40|$|Background: Vietnam has {{undergone}} a rapid transition in the past 20 years, moving towards a more equal situation for men and women. However, Confucian doctrine is still strong and {{little is known about}} men <b>s</b> violence against <b>women</b> within the Vietnamese family. Aim: To improve knowledge of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a Vietnamese context, by focusing on professionals and trusted community inhabitants explanations of the violence and their suggestions for preventive activities. Further, to present data on prevalence, risk factors and health effects and to suggest appropriate intervention and prevention activities. Method: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the rural district, Ba Vi in northern Vietnam in 2002. Five focus group discussions were held and face-to-face interviews following a questionnaire developed by WHO for violence research were performed. In the epidemiological part, 883 married/partnered women aged 17 60 were included. Bi- and multivariate analyses were undertaken, with effect modification analyses and calculation of attributable fractions and population attributable fractions. Main findings: In the explorative qualitative study, intimate partner violence was explained as interplay between individual and family-related factors and socio-cultural norms and practices where Confucian ideology exerted a strong influence (paper I). It further revealed that IPV was rarely discussed openly in the community and women subjected to violence kept silent. The epidemiological study revealed that out of the 883 married/partnered women, 30. 9 % had been subjected to physical violence in their lifetime, and 8. 3 % in the preceding year. For the combined exposure to physical and sexual violence, the corresponding figures were 32. 7 % and 9. 2 %. The most commonly occurring form was psychological abuse (lifetime 55. 4 %; past year 33. 7 %). Lifetime experience of sexual violence was reported by 6. 6 % of the women, and by 2. 2 % for previous year exposure. In the majority of cases, the violence was exerted as repeated acts (paper II). The risk factors found for lifetime and past year physical/sexual violence were <b>women</b> <b>s</b> low <b>education,</b> husbands low education, low household income and male polygamy. The pattern of factors associated with psychological abuse alone were husband s low professional status and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> intermediate level of education (paper II). Women who witnessed interparental violence during childhood {{were significantly more likely to}} report experience of physical and sexual intimate partner violence in their own relationship at adult age and they also displayed a more tolerant attitude towards violence (paper III). When health effects were investigated, itwas found that physical and sexual violence caused chronic pain, injuries and serious mental health problems such as sadness/depression and suicidal thoughts in exposed women (Paper IV). Conclusions: IPV is commonly occurring in rural Vietnam, more so among the low educated and in poorer households. Violence perpetration is a serious violation of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> human rights that causes long-term suffering in exposed women. These findings call for legal and policy actions. Collaboration between the health sector and other bodies at all levels, and with community leaders as spokesmen would help to improve openness and reduce society s tolerance of violence against women...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.
