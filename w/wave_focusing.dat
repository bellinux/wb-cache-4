This gives two main advantages; firstly the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of a defect echo can be enhanced, secondly it can be used as an additional tool to help discriminate between ‘real' and ‘false' indications. However, there are disadvantages associated with this technique; firstly, the defect location must be known before the focusing can be applied, secondly, the separate data set required for the active focusing technique can also significantly reduce the time and cost efficiency of GWT.|$|E

In addition, the transform is used to facilitate analysis of nonlinear wave-wave interactions within <b>focused</b> <b>wave</b> groups from a uni-directional numerical wave tank developed at Imperial College London. Experiments in an offshore wave basin at HR Wallingford are designed to measure free surface elevation at multiple locations in the vicinity of a multicolumn structure subjected to regular and irregular waves for a range of frequencies and steepness. Results from regular wave data analysis for first order amplitudes are compared to analytical linear diffraction theory, which is shown to be accurate for predicting incident waves of low steepness. However, second and third order responses are also computed, and the effects in the vicinity of a second order near trapping frequency are compared to semi-analytical second order diffraction theory. Analytical linear diffraction theory is extended for application to <b>focused</b> <b>wave</b> groups and random seas. Experimental irregular wave data are analysed for comparison with this theory.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Guided wave phased-array {{focusing}} {{techniques have}} been studied and applied in the long-range guided wave inspection of industrial pipelines. Advantages include longer inspection distance, greater wave penetration power and higher detection sensitivity. For reasons of protection, safety and thermal efficiency, {{a large percentage of}} pipes are coated and/or encased and buried underground. A phased-array focusing study for guided waves is now considered on pipelines with viscoelastic coatings. In this paper, longitudinal guided <b>wave</b> <b>focusing</b> as well as axisymmetric wave propagation is studied in a bare pipe and a pipe with a viscoelastic coating. A finite element model is studied. First, an investigation on whether the coating has an affect on the axisymmetric guided wave propagation is reported.
