500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After <b>working</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the team during the preseason, {{he started the}} season on the Physically Unable to Perform list.

In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. I know I can get the job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E

The songs, [...] "Baby, I'm for Real" [...] and [...] "The Bells", became hits as a result. On March 16, 1970, Terrell succumbed from her illness, a month before her 25th birthday.

6000|$|Among our greater artists, {{the chief}} want, {{at the present}} day, is that of solemnity and {{definite}} purpose. We have too much picture-manufacturing, too much making up of lay figures with a certain quantity of foliage, and a certain quantity of sky, and a certain quantity of water,--a little bit {{of all that is}} pretty, a little sun, and a little shade,--a touch of pink, and a touch of blue,--a little sentiment, and a little sublimity, and a little humor, and a little antiquarianism,--all very neatly associated in a very charming picture, but not working together for a definite end. Or if the aim be higher, {{as was the case with}} Barrett and Varley, we are generally put off with stale repetitions of eternal composition; a great tree, and some goats, and a bridge and a lake, and the Temple at Tivoli, etc. Now we should like to see our artists <b>working</b> <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> all exertion of their concentrated powers, such marked pieces of landscape character as might bear upon them the impression of solemn, earnest, and pervading thought, definitely directed, and aided by every accessory of detail, color, and idealized form, which the disciplined feeling, accumulated knowledge, and unspared labor of the painter could supply. I have alluded, in the second preface, to the deficiency of our modern artists in these great points of earnestness and completeness; and I revert to it, in conclusion, as their paramount failing, and one fatal in many ways to the interests of art.
