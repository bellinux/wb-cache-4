25|$|The {{history of}} modern water {{management}} in Egypt {{begins with the}} construction of the Old Aswan Dam in 1902 and barrages on the Nile in the 19th and early 20th century. The Old Aswan Dam partially stored the waters of the Nile to allow the growing of multiple crops per year in the Nile Delta, while the barrages raised the water level of the Nile so that water could be diverted into large irrigation channels running in parallel to the river. The <b>water</b> <b>regime</b> of the river was changed fundamentally in 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was completed, eliminating the annual Nile flood. The dam brought major benefits such as increased water availability for Egyptian agriculture leading to higher income and employment, hydropower production, flood control, improved navigation, and the creation of fisheries in Lake Nasser. But it also had environmental and social impacts including resettlement, loss of fertile silt that now accumulates in the reservoir behind the dam, waterlogging combined with an increase in soil salinity, and increased coastal erosion.|$|E

Studying genotype by <b>watering</b> <b>regime</b> interactions is necessary to improve plant adaptation to low water availability. In cultivated tomato [i](Solanum lycopersicum[/i] L.), extensively grown in dry areas, well-mastered water deficits can stimulate metabolite production, increasing plant defenses and concentration of compounds involved in fruit quality, at the same time. However, few tomato Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and genes involved in response to drought are identified or only in wild species. In this study, we phenotyped a population of 119 recombinant inbred lines derived from {{a cross between a}} cherry tomato and a large fruit tomato, grown in greenhouse under two <b>watering</b> <b>regimes,</b> in two locations. A large genetic variability was measured for 19 plant and fruit traits, under the two watering treatments. Highly significant genotype by <b>watering</b> <b>regime</b> interactions were detected and resulted from re-ranking more than scale changes.

The potential use of these species in an extensive green roof system in coastal areas would lead to additional benefits such as preserving and enhancing the local landscape character and supporting biodiversity. The growth of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Halimione portulacoides in an extensive green roof system under two <b>watering</b> <b>regimes</b> (30 % ET 0 and 15 % ET 0) was investigated. The substrates used consisted of soil (S), pumice (Pum) and grape marc compost (C) or peat (P), at various volumetric proportions indicated by the subscripts: S 15 :Pum 70 :C 15, S 15 :Pum 70 :P 15 and S 15 :Pum 70 :P 7. 5 :C 7. 5. Biometric measurements to determine plant growth included plant height and diameter, growth index, dry weights and ground cover.

2500|$|It can be {{understood}} as a situation in which a species' interactions with its biotic and abiotic environment seem to indicate a history of coevolution, when in actuality the relevant traits evolved in response to a different set of biotic and abiotic conditions. [...] The simplest form of ecological fitting is resource tracking, in which an organism continues to exploit the same resources, but in a new host or environment. In this framework, the organism occupies a multidimensional operative environment defined by the conditions in which it can persist, similar to the idea of the Hutchinsonian niche. [...] In this case, a species can colonize new environments (e.g. an area with the same temperature and <b>water</b> <b>regime)</b> and/or form new species interactions (e.g. a parasite infecting a new host) which can lead to the misinterpretation of the relationship as coevolution, although the organism has not evolved and is continuing to exploit the same resources it always has. The more strict definition of ecological fitting requires that a species encounter an environment or host outside of its original operative environment and obtain realized fitness based on traits developed in previous environments that are now co-opted for a new purpose. [...] This strict form of ecological fitting can also be expressed either as colonization of new habitat or the formation of new species interactions.|$|E

40|$|As an {{essential}} indicator of soil quality, soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions {{play an important}} role in many soil chemical, physical, and biological properties. A 4 -year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different nutrient and <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> on paddy soil organic carbon quality by measuring the major SOC fractions. Four nutrient regimes were compared: (i) control; (ii) chemical fertilizers only (CF), (iii) combined application of chemical fertilizers with farmyard manure (FYM) (CM), and (iv) combined application of chemical fertilizers and wheat straw (CS). Two soil <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> included continuous waterlogging (CWL) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). The total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in paddy soil were 40 - 60 % and 37 - 67 % higher in the combined organic sources and chemical fertilizers treatment against the sole chemical fertilizers treatment (CF), especially under continuous waterlogging (CWL). By fractionalizing SOC, it was observed that, under the <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> of CWL, easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and mineralizable organic carbon (MNC) in the organically treated paddy soil were significantly (P 250 mum (WSA) decreased by 42 - 45 % and clay dispersion ratio (R(CD)) increased by 12 - 38 %, as compared to the <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> of AWD, when FYM or wheat straw was incorporated into paddy soil. Correlation analysis showed that, under the <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> of AWD, WSA was significantly and positively related to EOC, LFOC and POC with the coefficients (r) of 0. 822, 0. 889, 0. 912 (P< 0. 01), respectively.

The <b>water</b> <b>regimes</b> were full irrigation (FI), DI every other week during flowering, pod initiation, seed filling and commencement of maturity. Average seasonal extinction coefficient (Î») ranged from 0.45 for DI during commencement of maturity to 0.47 for the other deficit methods. Pooled over the seasons and across <b>water</b> <b>regimes,</b> the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation was strongly correlated with the leaf area index (LAI). The aerial dry matter was strongly correlated with daily photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for all <b>water</b> <b>regimes.</b> Across the <b>water</b> <b>regimes,</b> average seasonal RUE ranged from 1.07 Â gÂ MJâ 1 incident photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) for FI to 1.19 Â gÂ MJâ 1 IPAR for DI during pod initiation. Reduction in the seasonal RUE ranged from 3.8 to 19.7 Â % for DI, while for the yield it ranged from 15.6 to 45.8 Â %. Seed yield was positively and significantly correlated (pÂ <Â  0.0001) with RUE, cumulative intercepted PAR and HI across <b>water</b> <b>regimes.</b> WP is positively related with seed yield (r 2 Â =Â  0.98; pÂ <Â  0.0001), total intercepted PAR (r 2 Â =Â  0.99; pÂ <Â  0.0001) and RUE (r 2 Â =Â  0.54; pÂ =Â  0.02).

The objective of this work is to give a thorough description of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that are at the basis of the O 3 -tolerance of lichens. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlaF) emission, histochemical ROS localization in the lichen thallus, and biochemical markers [enzymes and antioxidants involved in the ascorbate/glutathione (AsA/GSH) cycle; hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and superoxide anion (O 2 â¢â) ] were used to characterize the response of the epiphytic lichen Flavoparmelia caperata (L.) Hale exposed to O 3 (250 ppb, 5 h dâ 1, 2 weeks) at different <b>watering</b> <b>regimes</b> and air relative humidity (RH) in a fumigation chamber. After two-week exposure ChlaF was affected by the <b>watering</b> <b>regime</b> but not by O 3.
