25|$|Cripps's mission failed as Gandhi {{would accept}} {{nothing less than}} independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than {{difference}} of opinion to estrange us. We had differences {{from the time we}} became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> successor.Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{portions}} of Champollion's works were edited by Jacques and published posthumously. His Grammar and Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian {{had been left}} almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838. Before his death, he had told his brother [...] "Hold it carefully, I hope that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> calling card for posterity". It contained his entire theory and method, including classifications of signs and their decipherments, and also a grammar including how to write and conjugate nouns and verbs. But it was marred by the still tentative nature of many readings, and Champollion's conviction that the hieroglyphs could be read directly in Coptic, whereas in fact they represented a much older stage of the language which differs in many ways from Coptic.|$|E

The album was initially {{going to be the}} third installment to his Man on the Moon series, which he announced when he revealed he would not be releasing the A Man Named Scott mixtape, to focus on his rock project and [...] "MOTM3". Be that as it may, in the summer of 2012 Cudi announced the title of his third studio album when he tweeted: [...] "My new album is entitled indicud, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> version of The Chronic 2001, some songs i'll produce, others i'll feat &/or play songwriter". The title Indicud, is a play-on-words on the putative species of the genus Cannabis, indica, and Cudi's own name.|$|E

[...] On March 11, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50— five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale.

[...] ("Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.") Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: [...] "je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!"

500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is so, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then."

500|$|Craig began poorly; in ten innings {{before the}} Tests started, he scored only 146 runs at 14.60 without passing fifty. He was {{overlooked}} for the First Test, {{and continued to}} struggle for runs during the tour; he ended with 429runs in 27innings with a top score of 71 not out and an average of 16.50. He was not selected for any Tests. Craig had difficulty adjusting to the English pitch conditions and his confidence plummeted. Craig had particular trouble against off cutters on the seaming pitches. In a reception at Lord's, the home of cricket, Queen Elizabeth II asked him [...] "I understand {{this is your first}} visit to England?", which prompted Craig to reply [...] "Yes, your majesty, and unless my batting improves, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last." [...] During the tour, tensions sometimes arose between the senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Craig tended to abstain from alcohol. Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers.|$|E

Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy {{that she could not}} tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: [...] "I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> wife!" [...] The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: [...] "penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from [...] "a family bristling with artists and eccentrics". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: [...] "Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed".|$|E

The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess. For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State {{to deal with the}} situation. But she was given the reply, [...] "Later on."
