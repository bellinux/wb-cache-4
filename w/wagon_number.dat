50|$|The {{majority}} of the sections below deal solely with carriage and <b>wagon</b> <b>numbering</b> series, though where a particular classification system was used this is also described.|$|R
5000|$|From about 1922, {{by order}} of the Reich Transport Ministry (RVM), almost all goods wagons were marked {{with the name of}} their owner, [...] "Deutsche Reichsbahn", the name of a {{so-called}} [...] "class district" [...] (Gattungsbezirk), a <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> ( [...] wagonnummer) and a category letter (Category letters). The wagon bodies were painted in red-brown livery (paint number 11a,29), the wagon roofs in light grey (paint number 47) and the chassis, railings, etc., in a black colour (paint numbers 14,24,33). In 1927 the DR switched over to standard colours (Einheitsfarben) based on the Deutsche Reichsbahn's RAL colour system 840-B, see here too. From 1942, most of the wagons simply bore the letters [...] "DR", the name of the class district, a <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> and a category letter.|$|E
50|$|The 968xxx series (in the {{carriage}} and <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> series) {{was used for}} departmental locomotives from 1968 onwards. Previously, some former Class 08 shunters that were converted to snowploughs had been numbered in the 966xxx series, but this was discontinued {{and some of these}} locomotives were renumbered into the 968xxx series.|$|E
5000|$|A new wagon {{numbering}} system was adopted in Indian Railways in 2003. Wagons are allocated 11 digit numbers [...] {{making it easy}} for identification and computerization of the wagon information. The first two digits indicate Type of Wagon. Next two digits indicate Owning Railway. Next two digits indicate Year of Manufacture. Next four digits indicate Individual <b>Wagon</b> <b>Number</b> and the last digit is a Check digit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> (or coach numbers) are {{key data}} for railway operations. They enable a railway wagon or coach to be {{positively}} identified {{and form a}} common language between railway operators, infrastructure companies and the state authorities. The system of <b>wagon</b> <b>numbering</b> has been laid down by the International Union of Railways (Union internationale des chemins de fer or UIC) and {{is similar to that}} used for the locomotives and multiple units. Vehicle numbering is now governed by the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail and in Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) of the European Union.|$|R
50|$|Wagons {{were painted}} in red oxide, {{generally}} identified by 24 in high letters BR in white. <b>Wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> were {{shown on the}} lower left of the vehicles, while load and tare details were on the lower right.|$|R
50|$|This {{was shown}} most obviously, because wagons up to L1236, built up to December 1924, are fitted with gable roofs. The final 196 <b>wagons,</b> <b>numbers</b> 1237 and on, have curved roofs and were built with auto-couplers from new.|$|R
5000|$|The RIV {{laid down}} the {{technical}} requirements that a wagon had to meet {{in order to be}} used in international service. Wagons that fulfilled these requirements were given the letters RIV and were allowed to be used on all RIV railways without special permission. It was possible to tell from the first two numbers of the 12-digit <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> whether it was a RIV wagon. They were given the numbers: ...|$|E
5000|$|No prefix {{letters were}} used for {{internal}} user stock. Departmental wagons (and some passenger-rated non-passenger carrying coaching stock) often kept their original revenue earning stock number, but {{with the addition of}} the [...] "D" [...] prefix. On some occasions, passenger coaches that had been converted for use as wagons then entered departmental stock retaining their <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> (most notably brake vans in the 963xxx series that were formerly passenger brake vehicles).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} table {{contains the}} {{complete list of}} standard category letters. Letters A, B, C, D, P and W are reserved for coaches. However, also S is used for coaches and this doubles a goods wagons class. These are covered in detail in the article on UIC classification of railway coaches.Each goods wagons type is given a type number, whose first digit forms the fifth digit of the 12-digit UIC <b>wagon</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Auscision Models {{released}} {{a run of}} U four-wheeled louvre vans in August 2011, retailing at $239.95AUD per pack of six wagons, representing all types of wagons with fifteen feet between axles. A list of <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> is available here: List ...|$|R
50|$|The {{check digit}} is {{calculated}} from digits 1-11 using the Luhn algorithm. It {{is derived from}} the sum of the numbers that arise when the digits are alternately multiplied by 2 and 1; the difference of this sum from the next multiple of ten produces the check digit (for examples of this see <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do {{not conform}} to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From about 1942 {{almost all}} goods wagons of the Deutsche Reichsbahn were inscribed merely with the {{initials}} [...] "DR", {{together with the}} name of a so-called [...] "class district" [...] (Gattungsbezirk), a <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> ( [...] Wagennummer) and category letters (Gattungszeichen). From 1940, the livery colours were changed again, for example, from December 1941 the iron roofs of covered wagons were painted black-brown (not a RAL colour) and, from, 1943, in a grey-black colour (RAL 7021).|$|E
5000|$|In 1927 the DR {{switched}} over {{to standard}} colours (Einheitsfarben) {{based on the}} RAL colour system 840-B. From 1940, the livery colours were changed again, for example, from December 1941 the iron roofs of covered wagons were painted grey-black (RA 7021) and no longer in green-grey, and, from 1942, most of the wagons only bore the letters [...] "DR", {{the name of the}} class district, a <b>wagon</b> <b>number</b> and a category letter.|$|E

25|$|The TOPS {{system has}} been perpetuated by the privatised railway, though the {{allocation}} of classes and numbers appears to have become more random and less governed by the rules followed by British Railways (but even they made exceptions). See British Carriage and <b>Wagon</b> <b>Numbering</b> and Classification for an explanation of how TOPS applied also to carriages and wagons.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} 35 new-build wagons {{were constructed}} {{to supplement the}} class from 1985, with <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> 36 through 60 and 1001-1010 being built new as VHMY. The lower-numbered batch fell into use with {{the others in the}} fleet, while the 1000-series wagons were painted in Metropolitan Transit green and used as a block ballast train for the suburban network.|$|R

50|$|According to the Traveller's Guide (Blue Cover) <b>Wagon</b> <b>number</b> 50, a 4- wheel Iron Horse Dandy, {{built at}} Boston Lodge c.1861 {{was still in}} {{existence}} and stored at the Ffestiniog Railway museum as of April 1992. Other names for horse-carrying cars are âdandy cartâ and âdandy truckâ: they all refer to a vehicle on a horse-worked railway that a horse pulls {{to the top of}} the hill and rides down the hill in. The term âdandy cartâ is also used to refer to horse-drawn passenger trains on occasion.|$|E
50|$|In December 1992, Dutch {{journalist}} Aad Wagenaar {{started to}} research her identity. By following {{the number on}} the outside of the <b>wagon,</b> <b>number</b> 10, 16 or 18, the description of the wagon, and the identity of a single suitcase that appears in the shot, he quickly discovered that the transport took place on May 19, 1944, and that it was a mixed transport of Dutch Romanies and Jews. On February 7, 1994, at a trailer camp in Spijkenisse, Crasa Wagner was able to remember and to reveal the name of Settela Steinbach.|$|E
50|$|Goods wagons or {{freight wagons}} (North America: goods cars or freight cars) are {{unpowered}} railway vehicles {{that are used}} for the transportation of cargo. A variety of wagon types are in use to handle different types of goods, but all goods wagons in a regional network typically have standardized couplers and other fittings, such as hoses for air brakes, allowing different wagon types to be assembled into trains. For tracking and identification purposes, goods wagons are generally assigned a unique identifier, typically a UIC <b>wagon</b> <b>number,</b> or in North America, a company reporting mark plus a company specific serial number.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s BR {{substantially}} {{reduced its}} rolling stock and infrastructure for wagonload traffic, total <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> {{were reduced to}} 137,000 in 1979 from over 400,000 in 1968; from 1973 to 79 {{a third of the}} system's marshalling yards were closed, and freight depots were reduced by nearly one fifth; in the same period total air braked wagons nearly doubled in number.|$|R
5000|$|The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped {{them into}} classes Essen and Breslau, two series being needed because a single range of <b>wagon</b> <b>numbers</b> was not enough. As state railway {{vehicles}} they bore the letter marking [...] "Ommku" [...] {{and in the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn [...] "Om". In the DB, these trucks continued to bear the letter marking Om and class number (Bauartnummer) 12 until 1964.|$|R
