The entire 13-ship task force had arrived in Darwin by 13 January 1975, bringing over 3,000 personnel. RAN personnel was primarily assigned to clear the suburbs of Nightcliff, Rapid Creek, Northern Territory, and Casuarina, while aircraft and helicopters were used to move evacuees and supplies, and CDT1 inspected ships in the harbour for damage and cleared several wharves. Vessels of the task force began to depart Darwin as early as 7 January, with HMA Ships Brisbane and Stalwart the last to depart on 31 January, after command of the relief operation was turned over to the Commandant of the Army's 7th Military District.|$|E

25|$|The venture {{was not a}} {{commercial}} success, and it was sold to various millers, who owned watermills along its length. The section above Swafield locks was abandoned in 1893, and from 1922 it was owned by the North Walsham Canal Company, set up by Edward Cubitt and George Walker, who were mill owners. The last commercial use of the canal was in 1934, and it avoided nationalisation in 1948. With the dawning of the leisure age, the canal {{was seen as an}} easy one to restore, but work to do so did not start until 2000, when the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) started to run <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> for volunteers. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed, and jointly run <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> with the EAWA. In 2009, part of the canal was sold to the Old Canal Company, who have worked to restore two locks and the pounds in between, in order to run Bacton Wood Mill as a watermill. Rewatering was interrupted by the Environment Agency issuing a stop notice in April 2012, but negotiations continue.|$|E

25|$|German {{positions}} in the neighbourhood of Martinpuich were systematically bombarded by the guns of III Corps, results being reviewed by the examination of photographs taken by reconnaissance aircrews. The field batteries concentrated on wire cutting, which was observed by ground and air observers and German artillery retaliated with great accuracy, directed by observers in High Wood. <b>Working</b> <b>parties</b> of the 15th Division managed to dig four jumping off trenches beyond the front line, called Egg, Bacon, Ham and Liver. Dumps of bombs and ammunition were accumulated, dressing stations were built and water supplies established.|$|E

The lock was reopened on 21 June 2014 by Simon Carter, a local landowner with land adjoining this section of the canal. <b>Working</b> <b>parties</b> have since concentrated on the building of Gennets Bridge Lock (lock 8), a major exercise requiring {{the construction of a new}} concrete shell, faced with locally made bricks, and a bridge for a bridleway as nothing was left of the original lock structure.|$|E
25|$|In mid-February, the {{division}} moved south {{to take over}} a section of the line from the French Army.

The First Surreys had a tough fight to take Moislans trench on 2 September, {{even though they were}} officially following up in support, because the attacking forces were also badly thinned – 1/21st Bn itself could only put 100 men into the battle. By now, 47 Division was in need of reinforcements that were not forthcoming; after calling up detached <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> the First Surreys provided a composite company of 150 men for the operations of 6–7 September, after which {{the division}} was pulled out of the offensive.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 1702, Louis of Baden {{left his}} camp at Langenkandel and {{advanced}} his entire army to {{the vicinity of}} Landau. He disposed his troops in six encampments around the fortress with his headquarters at Arzheim. In the siege which began on the 16th, three attacks were planned. Louis personally directed the main attack against the south gate. The counts of Nassau-Weilburg and Leiningen led the Palatine troops in a false attack against the earthworks on Queichausfluss while Thüngen commanded the attack against the Crownwork. Using their plentiful supply of ammunition, the French gunners delivered heavy and accurate fire on the Imperial trenching forces.

After holding {{a section of the}} line near Festubert in early May, the battalion became the first in the 47th Division to go into action. As the left hand unit of the division it was temporarily attached to the neighbouring 22nd Brigade of 7th Division, which attacked on 16 May during the Battle of Festubert. Elements of the battalion advanced as far as the German support line, but found themselves ahead of their flanking troops and returned to hold the captured German front line.

25|$|To {{deny the}} British {{the use of}} Province and Carpenter's Islands, the Americans broke the {{riverside}} dikes. This act forced their enemies to build their batteries {{on top of the}} dikes and to labor in knee-deep water. As an example of the difficulties involved, the British lost an 8-inch howitzer and a soldier drowned when the craft carrying the gun sank in the Schuylkill. On the night of October 10, Captain John Montresor had his crews begin work on a battery on Carpenter's Island, opposite the fort. At this time, the British already had constructed a two gun battery near the mouth of the Schuylkill River. On the 11th, Hazelwood and Smith launched a joint attack by row galleys on the <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> After losing one man killed and one wounded, a total of two officers and 56 enlisted men from the 1st Grenadier Battalion waved the white flag. The prisoners were quickly herded into the Americans' boats before engineer Captain James Moncrieffe could arrive with a rescue party of Hessians. The British court martialed two officers for this setback.|$|E
25|$|Vaitupuans {{celebrate}} Te Aso Fiafia (Happy Day) on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 {{which was}} the date on which the final instalment of a debt of $13,000 was repaid to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, Samoa. Vaitupu history is that Thomas William Williams, the Ruge agent, pretended to do his customers a favour {{by allowing them to}} obtain goods on credit. In 1883 the debt of the Vaitupuans was $13,000 and H. M. Ruge and Company had threatened to seize the entire island unless the debt was repaid. Neemia, a Vaitupuan pastor living in Samoa, returned and organised <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> to collect coconuts and prepare copra to sell to pay off the debt, with Henry Nitz, the Webber & Co agent on Vaitupu, contributing money to meet the final payment. The Vaitupuans, with the help of their friends from Funafuti, repaid the debt by the due date. Seven thousand dollars was repaid by 1886 and the balance was paid on 25 November 1887.|$|E
25|$|The atomic {{bombings in}} Japan at Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 {{followed}} {{by that of}} Nagasaki on 9 August precipitated the abrupt end of the war. On 15 August 1945, Japan announced its official unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers. The POWs learned of the surrender {{early in the morning}} of 15 August, in a broadcast by Radio Chungking received by the secret radio. Pringle made one last journey through the jungle to inform his Chinese friends. The news was immediately broken to the British other ranks' compound, and quickly spread to the other compounds. Celebratory meals were prepared, with precious supplies and livestock used up. The Japanese guards were unaware of their country's surrender, and as the day coincided with an official camp holiday, marking the opening of the camp on 15 August three years previously, they were satisfied that the celebrations were related to the break from the <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> The women learned shortly afterwards, when the married women had their scheduled meeting with their husbands.|$|E
50|$|Marketing as a {{recognised}} professional skill {{standing in}} its own right is relatively new, and the idea for a City Guild for senior marketing professionals first came about in 1969. A <b>working</b> <b>party</b> was set up in 1973 and several senior Fellows of the Institute of Marketing subsequently helped gain the support of the Court of Aldermen in the City of London for establishment of a Guild. Reginald Bowden, chairman of the <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> became Founder Master, serving from 1975 to 1978. On 14 April 1978 letters patent were presented to the Guild of Marketors and it became a livery company. Reginald Bowden was followed as Master by several other members of the initial <b>working</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of the squadron's enlisted Marines (including NCOs and Staff NCOs), other than a few aircrewmen in some squadrons (primarily HMH, HMM, HMLA, VMM, and VMGR), are aircraft maintenance technicians and supervisors. There are also {{a small number of}} enlisted clerks and specialists who perform various support (e.g., administration, intelligence, operations, and logistics) duties in the several staff departments. The enlisted Marines, NCOs, and Staff NCOs, are most often devoted full-time to performing their duties in either the AMD or applicable staff department. From time-to-time, enlisted Marines may be assigned to perform mess duty, or fatique details (<b>working</b> <b>parties)</b> supervised by NCOs, and (along with NCOs, Staff NCOs, and officers) stand watch, perform interior guard duty, participate in local-area security patrols, or airfield/base-defense operations. Additionally, as Marines, the squadron is required to maintain the tactical, technical, small-arms weapons proficiency, and physical fitness capability, along with the requisite discipline, morale, espirit de corps, and fighting spirit to enable the squadron to form into provisional rifle platoons, to either reinforce the attack or augument the defense, as the overall tactical situation necessitates.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{also ordered}} the {{defenses}} to be improved. [...] Trenches were dug on the Boston Neck, and then extended toward Boston. However, these activities {{had little effect}} on the British occupation. [...] The <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> were fired on from time to time, as were sentries guarding the works. On July 30, in retaliation for an American attack, the British pushed back an American advanced guard, and burned a few houses in Roxbury. Four days later, on August 2, an American rifleman was killed, and his body hung up by the neck. In retaliation, other American riflemen marched to the lines and began to attack the British troops. They continued their sharp shooting all day, killing or wounding many of the British, and losing only one man.|$|E
500|$|On 11 July the {{activity}} on Moreno's ships indicated to British observers at Gibraltar that the combined squadron was readying for sea, and the British <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> repairing Saumarez's squadron correspondingly redoubled their efforts. The {{arrival of a}} light easterly wind which would favour passage back to Cadiz encouraged both Moreno and Saumarez to prepare for departure to the Atlantic base on the following day. At 12:00 on 12 July, Caesar warped out of Gibraltar dockyard with her band playing the popular song [...] "Heart of Oak" [...] to the answering strains of [...] "Britons, Strike Home!" [...] from the dockside as crowds again turned out in their thousands to watch the coming battle. By that time however, Moreno's forces were already at sea: at dawn on 12 July the leading Spanish ships loosed their sails and by 12:00 the French and Spanish squadron had begun to gather at their rendezvous point off Cabrita Point {{at the mouth of}} Algeciras Bay. At 15:00, Saumarez set sail, his pennant flying from Caesar and followed by ships of the line Superb, HMS Spencer, HMS Venerable and HMS Audacious, frigates Thames and the Portuguese Carlotta and several smaller vessels. Both Saumarez and Linois expected reinforcements sent by Lord Keith to arrive during the day, but none appeared.|$|E
