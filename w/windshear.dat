5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>windshear</b> or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} Tropical Disturbance 08F developed {{within a}} convergence zone about 325km (200mi) {{to the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. Tropical Disturbance 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple of days, and was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized tropical disturbance developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical <b>windshear,</b> but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical <b>windshear</b> over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, Tropical Disturbance 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was then last noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E

5|$|While {{over land}} the system moved towards the {{south-southwest}} {{and moved into}} the Bligh Waters, where it started to rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system. As a result, before the system made landfall on Viti Levu, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and named it Gene. The system then made landfall shortly after 0600UTC near Lautoka, before it started to move westwards and passed near Nadi before it {{moved out of the}} archipelago. Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards, RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into a category two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into a Category 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical <b>windshear.</b> However, the system quickly reintensified and by 1200UTC the next day had become a category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

Over {{the next couple of days}}, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure.

During the next day, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi started to monitor {{the system as a}} tropical depression as it moved through the Loyalty Islands. On March 11, the depression intensified into a tropical cyclone as it moved southeastward, prompting RSMC Nadi to name it Atu at 1800UTC. Early on March 12, the JTWC reported that Atu had reached its peak 1-minute windspeeds of 100km/h (65mph). Later that morning RSMC Nadi reported that Atu had reached its peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 85km/h (50mph). After it had peaked in intensity, Atu weakened under the influence of strong vertical <b>windshear</b> before the JTWC and RSMC Nadi issued their final advisories during March 13 as Atu had become extratropical.

25|$|The {{investigation}} report {{stated that the}} weather conditions were a cause of the accident. During the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and {{a major change in}} wind speed could cause a stall. The aircraft experienced <b>windshear.</b> The altitude, the reaction time of the pilot, and the responsiveness of the aircraft combined to prevent the arrest of decent in time to avoid the accident. The crew did not adhere to any published approach procedure and they possibly misinterpreted the altimeter and airspeed indicator. During the descent, the pilot in command did not check his approach chart and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. There was inadequate communication between crew, deficient Crew Resource Management, and no approach briefings were made for either of the two approaches. The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down at a very long distance from the runway without having it in sight. The aircraft will not respond well to <b>windshear</b> in such a configuration. Both approaches require a circling procedure.|$|E

40|$|NASA {{is working}} with the FAA to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of pulse Doppler radar as a candidate airborne sensor to detect low altitude <b>windshears.</b> The need to provide the pilot with timely information about possible hazards has motivated a demand for real-time processing of a radar return. Investigated here is parallel processing as a means of accommodating the high data rates required. A PC based parallel computer, called the transputer, is used to investigate issues in real time concurrent processing of radar signals. A transputer network is made up of an array of single instruction stream processors that can be networked in a variety of ways. They are easily reconfigured and software development is largely independent of the particular network topology. The performance of the transputer is evaluated in light of the computational requirements. A number of algorithms have been implemented on the transputers in OCCAM, a language specially designed for parallel processing. These include signal processing algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), pulse-pair, and autoregressive modelling, as well as routing software to support concurrency. The most computationally intensive task is estimating the spectrum. Two approaches have been taken on this problem, the first and most conventional of which is to use the FFT. By using table look-ups for the basis function and other optimizing techniques, an algorithm has been developed that is sufficient for real time. The other approach is to model the signal as an autoregressive process and estimate the spectrum based on the model coefficients. This technique is attractive because it does not suffer from the spectral leakage problem inherent in the FFT. Benchmark tests indicate that autoregressive modeling is feasible in real time...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of pneumatic (blown) aerodynamic technology {{to both the}} lifting and the control surfaces of advanced transport aircraft can provide revolutionary changes in the performance and operation of these vehicles, ranging in speed regime from Advanced Subsonic Transports to the High Speed Civil Transport, and beyond. This technology, much of it based on the Circulation Control Wing blown concepts, can provide aerodynamic force augmentations of 80 to 100 (i. e., return of 80 - 100 pounds of force per pound of input momentum from the blowing jet). This can be achieved without use of external mechanical surfaces. Clever {{application of}} this technology can provide no-moving-part lifting surfaces (wings/tails) integrated into the control system to greatly simplify aircraft designs while improving their aerodynamic performance. Lift/drag ratio may be pneumatically tailored to fit the current phase of the flight, and takeoff/landing performance can be greatly improved by reducing ground roll distances and liftoff/touchdown speeds. Alternatively, great increases in liftoff weights and payloads are possible, as are great reductions in wing and tail planform size, resulting in optimized cruise wing designs. Furthermore, lift generation independent of angle of attack provides much promise for increased safety of flight in the severe updrafts/downdrafts of microbursts and <b>windshears,</b> which is further augmented by the ability to sustain flight at greatly reduced airspeeds. Load-tailored blown wings can also reduce tip vorticity during highlift operations and the resulting vortex wake hazards near terminal areas. Reduced noise may also be possible as these jets {{can be made to}} operate at low pressures. The planned presentation will support the above statements through discussions of recent experimental and numerical (CFD) research and development of these advanced blown aerodynamic surfaces, portions of which have been conducted for NASA. Also to be presented will be predicted performance of advanced transports resulting from these devices. Suggestions will be presented for additional innovative high-payoff research leading to further confirmation of these concepts and their application to advanced efficient commercial transport aircraft...|$|R

Despite this hierarchy, a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus, especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level. [...] There are a few species, each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical form. The species types are grouped below according to the physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated. [...] The forms, genera, and species are listed in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 October 2015, Governor Mark Capes {{indicated}} {{that once a}} month {{there would be a}} flight from St Helena to Ascension Island provided by Comair. The Ascension Island Government also announced a connection between the two islands. The connection was to be flown by Comair using a Boeing 737-800. The flight would have taken about two hours to Wideawake Airfield. Comair’s air services between St Helena Airport and OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg were scheduled to commence in late May 2016, to coincide with the official opening of the airport on 21 May 2016. These dates were postponed because of the problems with wind shear, however Comair did operate a few test flights which concluded in the <b>windshear</b> risk, mainly for aircraft of that size and larger ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed upon {{landing on}} N'djili Airport's Runway 24, shortly before 14:00 local time (13:00 UTC). The aircraft {{was on a}} domestic flight from Goma to Ndjili via Kisangani. Heavy rain was falling at the time. The METAR in force at the time showed thunder showers and rain. According to a United Nations official, the plane [...] "landed heavily, broke into two and caught fire". An eyewitness suggested <b>windshear</b> as a cause. The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Alain Le Roy indicated that the poor weather was {{a key element in}} the cause of the crash. The main part of the fuselage came to a rest inverted and in a badly damaged condition. The severe nature of the accident caused massive external and internal injuries to the occupants. ECR teams brought out the crew and the passengers from the wreckage. Most of them were already dead, while a few were badly injured but alive. Nine injured survivors were rushed to a local hospital, some of them died {{on the way to the}} hospital. Amongst those who reached the hospital alive, all but one succumbed to their injuries. Of the four Georgian crew and 29 passengers, there was only one survivor, Francis Mwamba, a Congolese journalist. The survivor was seriously injured. The aircraft manifest listed 20 UN workers. The passengers included UN peacekeepers and officials, humanitarian workers and electoral assistants. Five non-UN passengers were staff from non-governmental organisations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or from other international organisations.|$|E
