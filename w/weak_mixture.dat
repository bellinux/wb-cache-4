6000|$|All of which, and to {{that extent}} to be corrected, leaves small {{allowance}} for my service to good M. Ansiot, rendered while my elder and younger brothers--the younger completing our group of the ungovernessed--were continuously subject to collegial durance. Their ordeal was, I still blush to think, appreciably the heavier, as compared with mine, during our longer term of thrifty exile from Paris--the time of stress, as I find I recall it, when we had turned our backs on the Rue Montaigne and my privilege was so to roam on the winter and the spring afternoons. Mild M. Ansiot, [...] "under" [...] whom I for some three hours each forenoon sat sole and underided--and actually by himself too--was a curiosity, a benignity, a futility even, I gather; but save for a felt and remembered impulse in me to open the window of our scene of study {{as soon as he}} had gone was in no degree an ideal. He might rise here, could I do him justice, as the rarest of my poor evocations; for he it was, to be frank, who most literally smelt of the vieux temps--as to which I have noted myself as wondering and musing as much as might be, with recovered scraps and glimpses and other intimations, only never yet for such a triumph of that particular sense. To be still frank, he was little less than a monster--for mere unresisting or unresilient mass of personal presence I mean; so that I fairly {{think of him as a}} form of bland porpoise, violently blowing in an age not his own, as by having had to exchange deep water for thin air. Thus he impressed me as with an absolute ancientry of type, of tone, of responsible taste, above all; this last I mean in literature, since it was literature we sociably explored, to my at once charmed and shamed apprehension of the several firm traditions, the pure proprieties, the discussabilities, in the oddest way both so many and so few, of that field as they prevailed to his pious view. I must have had hold, in this mere sovereign sample of the accidentally, the quite unconsciously and unpretentiously, the all negligibly or superfluously handed-down, of a rare case of the provincial and academic cuistre; though even while I record it I see the good man as too helpless and unaggressive, too smothered in his poor facts of person and circumstance, of overgrown time of life alone, to incur with justness the harshness of classification. He rested with a weight I scarce even felt--such easy terms he made, without scruple, for both of us--on the cheerful innocence of my barbarism; and though our mornings were short and subject, I think, to quite drowsy lapses and other honest aridities, we did scumble together, I make out, by the aid of the collected extracts from the truly and academically great which formed his sole resource and which he had, in a small portable and pocketed library rather greasily preserved, some patch of picture of a saving as distinguished from a losing classicism. The point remains for me that when all was said--and even with everything that might directly have counted unsaid--he discharged for me such an office that I was to remain to this far-off hour in a state of possession of him that is the very opposite of a blank: quite after the fashion again in which I had all along and elsewhere suffered and resisted, and yet so perversely and intimately appropriated, tutoring; which was with as little as ever to show for my profit of his own express showings. The blank he fills out crowds itself with a wealth of value, since I shouldn't without him have been able to claim, for whatever it may be worth, a tenth (at that let me handsomely put it), of my [...] "working" [...] sense of the vieux temps. How can I allow then that we hadn't planted together, with a loose felicity, some of the seed of work?--even though the sprouting was so long put off. Everything, I have mentioned, had come at this time to be acceptedly, though far from braggingly, put off; and the ministrations of M. Ansiot really wash themselves over with the <b>weak</b> <b>mixture</b> that had begun to spread for me, to immensity, during that summer day or two of our earlier residence when, betraying strange pains and apprehensions, I was with all decision put to bed. Present to me still is the fact of my sharper sense, after an hour or two, of my being there in distress and, as happened for the moment, alone; present to me are the sounds of the soft afternoon, the mild animation of the Boulogne street through the half-open windows; present to me above all the strange sense that something had begun that would make more difference to me, directly and indirectly, than anything had ever yet made. I might verily, on the spot, have seen, as in a fading of day and a change to something suddenly queer, the whole large extent of it. I must thus, much impressed but half scared, have wanted to appeal; to which end I tumbled, all too weakly, out of bed and wavered toward the bell just across the room. The question of whether I really reached and rang it was to remain lost afterwards in the strong sick whirl of everything about me, under which I fell into a lapse of consciousness that I shall conveniently here treat as a considerable gap.|$|E

50|$|Staged {{combustion}} {{dates back}} to the hot bulb engine of the 1890s. The first stage of combustion occurred inside the hot bulb and the hot gases were then forced out into the cylinder, where they mixed with additional air, and the second stage of combustion took place. At this time, staged combustion was used because it was a convenient method of ignition and it is unlikely that there would have been much concern about air pollution. A modern application of the principle is the Stratified charge engine, in which a rich mixture is ignited by a spark and the resulting flame-front ignites the <b>weaker</b> <b>mixture</b> elsewhere in the cylinder.|$|R

Each tube, 22 x 10 mm and 50 nun diameter in cross section, respectively, was fitted with slide valves that with the tubes mounted vertically allowed known concentration gradients to form by diffusion. The peak-transmitted shock strength when a detonation is incident on an abrupt planar interface with an inert gas was found to agree reasonably well with the simple Paterson-Glass model. A significant improvement {{was found in the}} predicted values when allowance was made for the Taylor expansion and energy and momentum losses to the tube walls. Under certain conditions a secondary pressure pulse was observed behind the transmitted shock; the origin of this pulse is the explosion of the unreacted gas between the transmitted shock and the unburned gas. When incident on gradients of fuel concentration, the transmitted detonation wave velocity and cell size adjusted rapidly, to values appropriate to the local gas composition and wall boundary layer losses. Finally, it was shown that the mechanism of detonation initiation in a <b>weaker</b> <b>mixture</b> by an incident detonation propagated across a concentration gradient differs in one important respect from that in a homogeneous mixture in that a secondary shock is formed as an intermediate stage...|$|R
40|$|A set of tribrachial {{flames of}} n-heptane/air is {{simulated}} with finite rate chemistry and detailed transport in a realistic laminar jet configuration for which experimental data are available. The flames differ by {{the temperature of}} the unburnt mixture and stabilization height, which controls the mixture fraction gradient ahead of the flame front. The simulations reproduce the lift-off heights in the experiments, showing that the flame stabilizes further downstream as the unburnt temperature decreases. For the lowest unburnt temperature, resulting in a <b>weak</b> <b>mixture</b> fraction gradient at the tribrachial point, positive stretch along the rich premixed wing leads to an increase in the rate of chemical reaction in the whole flame. The tribrachial flame burning velocity exceeds that in the unstretched, one-dimensional flame. For the highest temperature, the flame stabilizes closest to the nozzle. Large flame tilt, large mixture fraction gradient, and small radius of curvature lead to a reduction in the heat release rate and the flame propagates slower than its one-dimensional counterpart.

These chemosensilla were characterized through electrophysiological experiments by stimulating with sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, myo-inositol and 20 common amino acids. In electrophysiological recordings from nine sensilla, responses were obtained to certain compounds tested at 100 mmol l– 1, {{and the response}} spectra differed from broad to narrow. The four sugars excited the same receptor neuron in sensillum a and sensillum b; sucrose and myo-inositol, sucrose and lysine, myo-inositol and lysine excited two different receptor neurons respectively in sensillum a; fructose and lysine excited two different receptor neurons in sensillum n. Furthermore, the four sugars, myo-inositol and lysine all elicited concentration-dependent electrophysiological responses. These six compounds also induced the proboscis extension reflex (PER) followed by ingestion of the solution when they were applied on the tarsi. Lysine and sucrose caused the strongest electrophysiological responses.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} a programme {{of research to}} determine ignition energy requirements in flowing kerosene spray air mixtures under various flow conditions such as velocity, mixture strength, spray mean drop size and drop distribution. In {{order to determine the}} spray characteristics of mixture ratio, mean drop size and drop distribution in the flowing fuel-air spray accurately, new designs have been evolved and employed. A single rectangular pulse of constant power was employed for initiating ignition in the mixture. The flow parameters were found to have considerable influence on spark characteristics and hence on the energy released in the spark. The breakdown voltage requirements of the spark in the two phase flow differed from they of premixed gaseous mixtures. In the range of <b>weak</b> <b>mixtures</b> investigated, optimum spark duration was found to vary depending on spray drop size between 30 and 60 microseconds. Minimum ignition energy increased with increase in velocity, but decreased with reduction in drop diameter and with increase in equivalence ratio. Low flow number atomisers giving small drop sizes extended the weak ignition limits for a given spark energy. Spray drop size and distribution were found to have a singularly large influence on all aspects of ignition.

40|$|Premixed gas flames in {{mixtures}} of CH 4, O 2, N 2 and CO 2 were studied numerically using detailed chemical and radiative emission-absorption models {{to establish the}} conditions for which radiatively-induced extinction limits may exist independent of the system dimensions. It was found that reabsorption of emitted radiation led to substantially higher burning velocities and wider extinction limits than calculations using optically-thin radiation models, particularly when CO 2, a strong absorber, {{is present in the}} unburned gas. Two heat loss mechanisms that lead to flammability limits even with reabsorption were identified. One is that for dry hydrocarbon-air mixtures, because of the differences in the absorption spectra of H 2 O and CO 2, most of the radiation from product H 2 O that is emitted in the upstream direction cannot be absorbed by the reactants. The second is that the emission spectrum of CO 2 is broader at flame temperatures than ambient temperature, thus some radiation emitted near the flame front cannot be absorbed by the reactants even when they are seeded with CO 2. Via both mechanisms some net upstream heat loss due to radiation will always occur, leading to extinction of sufficiently <b>weak</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Downstream loss has practically no influence. Comparison to experiment demonstrates the importance of reabsorption in CO 2 -diluted mixtures. It is concluded that fundamental flammability limits can exist due to radiative heat loss, but these limits are strongly dependent on the emission-absorption spectra of the reactant and product gases and their temperature dependence, and cannot be predicted using gray-gas or optically-thin model parameters. Applications to practical flames at high pressure, in large combustion chambers and with exhaust-gas or flue-gas recirculation are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Particulate Matter (PM) {{legislation}} for gasoline engines {{and the introduction}} of gasoline/ethanol blends, make it important to know the effect of fuel composition on PM emissions. Tests have been conducted with fuels of known composition in both a single cylinder engine and V 8 engine with a three-way catalyst. The V 8 engine used an unleaded gasoline (PURA) with known composition and distillation characteristics as a base fuel and with 10 % by volume ethanol. The single cylinder engine used a 65 % iso-octane - 35 % toluene mixture as its base fuel. The engines had essentially the same combustion system, with a centrally mounted 6 -hole spray-guided direct injection system. Particle size distributions were recorded and these have also been converted to mass distributions. Filter samples were taken for thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to give composition information. Both engines were operated at 1500 rpm under part load. The tests with the single cylinder engine used lambda of 0. 9, 1. 0 and 1. 1 with an ignition timing sweep of 15 - 45 °bTDC. The trends with the stoichiometric and <b>weak</b> <b>mixtures</b> were less clear (the PM emissions being at low levels), but with lambda of 0. 9 the trends were clear. For the rich mixture, advancing the ignition timing increased both PM number and mass emissions, and the use of E 10 reduced the number emissions by a factor of 25 - 65 and the mass emissions by a factor of 2 - 10. The V 8 tests were at stoichiometric with injection timing sweeps during induction (120 to 360 °bTDC), with a reduction in both PM number and mass due to reactions in the catalyst. The earlier injection gave lower PM emissions and this was attributed to there being more time for mixture preparation, leading to a more homogeneous mixture. The addition of 10 % ethanol led to an increase in PM emissions (both in terms of mass and number). Copyright © 2010 SAE International...|$|R

For masonry, considering both mortar and mortar-unit bond characteristics, a 0. 5 % volume fraction of micro fibers in type N Portland cement lime mortar appear to be a viable recipe for most masonry joint applications both for clay and concrete units. In general, clay units perform better with high water content fiber reinforced mortar (FRM) while concrete masonry units (CMUs) perform better with drier mixtures, so 130 % and 110 % flow rates should be targeted, respectively. For earth block masonry applications, fibers’ benefits are observed in improving local damage and water pressure resistance. The FRC retrofit technique proposed for the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete two-way slabs has exceeded expectations in terms of capacity increase for a relatively low cost in comparison to the common but expensive fiber reinforced polymer applications.

40|$|Hot gases {{formed as}} a result of {{combustion}} behave differently from normal hot gases of similar composition, and it is believed that a full appreciation of this fact would lead to the opening up of a wide field of profitable research. Experiments are described in the paper which show that flame gases hold within them a long-lived latent energy. I t has been found that the latent energy may amount to as much as, or even more than, 15 per cent of the heat of combustion; but it varies greatly with the conditions under which combustion takes place. These conditions have been investigated by means of explosion pressure and heat loss measurements, flame gas temperature measurements, and flame photography. Experiments are also described which show that in virtue of the latent energy an abnormally large amount of dissociation may obtain in flame gases. On account of this, a platinum wire im-mersed in flame gases may attain a far higher temperature (some hundreds of degrees Centigrade higher) than a similar wire coated with quartz, and this cannot be accounted for in terms of the different emissivities of the surfaces. There seems little doubt that this phenomenon may have an important bcaring upon such problems as the transmission of heat from flame gases and the selection of gas fire radiants.

A systematic investigation into the influence of homogeneous and stratified mixtures was undertaken by varying mixture reactivity, ignition position, injection position and mixture composition. A feature of this work has been the similarities in explosion phenomena between stratified and homogeneous explosions and between partially filled and fully filled geometries {{to the conclusion that}} the explosion severity recorded in stratified mixtures towards the lean flammability limit was in many cases much higher than the fuel concentration would normally suggest. Stratified mixtures with global equivalence ratio around stoichiometric produced significantly lower pressures than their homogeneous equivalents. However, stratified (globally) near-limit mixtures produced overpressures that were several hundred mbar higher than those of the equivalent homogeneous mixtures. Even beyond the flammable range (globally) the stratified mixtures produced significant overpressures. The phenomena discussed in this thesis illustrate the difficulty in designing adequate protection for such vented, duct vented and interconnected geometries, since even relatively small pocket of <b>weak</b> fuel-air <b>mixtures</b> produced relatively severe explosions. This can have implications for the safety design of inter-connected installations which are not intended to be subject to flammable mixtures. While it is an important conclusion from the work presented in this chapter that close to the flammability limits the stratified explosion severity was greater than its global concentration would normally indicate, it should be stressed that homogeneous stoichiometric tests still constitute the worst case tests. Therefore, it is not the suggestion of this work that the design of vented vessels should be modified to represent the maxima obtained in stratified work.

Inoculated wheat plots with a known ratio of more sensitive to less sensitive isolates of the leaf blotch fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola were sprayed with fungicide and sampled once symptoms had appeared. Selection for fluquinconazole resistance increased {{in proportion to the}} dose, up to one-half of the full dose (the maximum tested) in both experiments. At the higher doses of fluquinconazole, the addition of azoxystrobin was associated with a decrease in selection (nonsignificant in the first experiment) for triazole resistance. Control by low doses of fluquinconazole was increased by mixture with azoxystrobin, but at higher doses mixture with azoxystrobin sometimes decreased control, so that reduced selection was obtained at the cost of some reduction in control. The effects on resistance are not necessarily general consequences of mixing fungicides, and suggest that the properties of any specific mixture may need to be demonstrated experimentally. Selection was inversely related to control in the unmixed treatments in both experiments, but the relationship was <b>weaker</b> in the <b>mixtures</b> with azoxystrobin...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to provide a new {{clarification}} and critique of Birnbaum’s (1962) well-known argument purporting to show that principles of sufficiency and (weak) conditionality entail the (strong) likelihood principle. The argument has long been held as a significant result for the foundations of statistics. Not only do all of the familiar frequentist sampling theory notions violate the strong likelihood principle (SLP), the Birnbaum argument purports to show that the SLP follows from principles that sampling theorists accept. We argue that Birnbaum’s premises contain an equivocation of the vital terms leading to the unsoundness of the argument. Elucidating and extending existing critiques, we attempt to unravel the logical flaws that have enabled Birnbaum’s paradox to persist for over fifty years. Key terms: Birnbaumization, likelihood principle (<b>weak</b> and strong), <b>mixture</b> experiments, sufficiency, validity, weak conditionality. 1 I am extremely grateful to Aris Spanos and David Cox for numerous useful corrections and suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper, and for discussions over many years on this and closely related issues. My understanding of Birnbaum was also greatly facilitated by the work of, and discussions with, the philosopher of science, Ronald Giere. Thanks to Giere, who worked with Birnbaum for many years, I also possess Birnbaum’s original materials and notes...|$|R
40|$|Membrane for gas {{application}} {{have been widely}} used. Apart from that, ceramic membrane is gaining much attention towards separation technology due to its characteristics of offering high mechanical strength, chemical resistivity and thermal compatibility. However, production of ceramic membrane for gas separation in term of cost and energy reduce still remains as challenge until now, therefore this work addressed {{to the development of}} ceramic membrane from kaolin via simple phase inversion technique. First, ceramic membrane suspension have been prepared by stirring kaolin as raw material, N-methyl- 2 -pyrollidone (NMP) as solvent and polyethersulfone (PESf) as binder. Phase inversion tchnique conducted by casted the suspension on the glass plate with casting knife. In order to achieve the aims of this study, the development of ceramic membrane from kaolin were conducted into two objectives: (1) effect of particles sizes and, (2) effect of non-solvent coagulant bath. The types of kaolin particle sizes devoted as Type A kaolin (0. 4 - 0. 6 μm) and Type B kaolin (10 - 15 μm) whereas for different types of non-solvent were distilled water, ethanol and mixture of 70 % NMP and 30 % distilled water. Overall analysis showed that both effect of particle size and different caogulant generated different structure, properties and characteristic of membrane at two different composition. Polymer phase inversion is dominated at kaolin content of 24 to 34 wt. % that caused the formation of finger-like voids of the phase inversed structure with Type A kaolin and strong caogulant of distilled water. An opposed condition was shown at highest kaolin content of 39 wt. % for both parameter that can be correlated to the viscous fingering mechanism in the formation of ceramic membrane structure. A slightly similar results trends and pattern was demostrated with Type B kaolin and <b>weakest</b> coagulant (<b>mixture</b> of 70 % NMP and 30 % distilled water). Overall performance showed that membrane with Type A kaolin and immersed into ethanol as coagulant at kaolin content of 39 wt. % showed the highest rejection (5. 49 and 5. 82 for CO 2 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the development of an efficient synthetic route for a previously prepared self-polymerizable PPQ monomer mixture, 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -phenyl- 6 -fluoroquinoxaline and 3 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -phenyl- 6 -fluoroquinoxaline. Thus, the intermediate, 4 -hydroxybenzil, was synthesized in good yield, starting from phenol with phenylacetyl chloride, followed by oxidation. The other intermediate, 4 -fluoro- 1, 2 -phenylenediamine, was also less costly synthesized, starting from 2, 4 -difluoronitrobenzene with ammonium hydroxide, followed by reduction, giving excellent yield. The overall monomer yield was superior to previous reports. Another research objective involved preparation of various monomer mixtures that could be synthesized even less costly, and attempts on polymerization could generate the same structure of PPQ from an original monomer mixture. Thus, the monomer mixture that had switched functional groups from the original one, 2 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 3 -phenyl- 6 -hydroxyquinoxaline and 3 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 2 - phenyl- 6 -hydroxyquinoxaline, was prepared. Various monomers with different functional groups attached on the 6 -position of the quinoxaline ring, such as chloro- and nitro-substituted monomers instead of fluoro-substituted ones, were also prepared. Several attempts to build up high molecular weights were not successful. In the case of the switched monomer <b>mixture,</b> <b>weaker</b> nucleophility and less activation on the fluorine atom were to be the reason in the switched monomer. In the cases of chloro- and nitro-substituted monomers, poorer leaving power and side reactions were to be the reasons. close 111...|$|R
40|$|The protein fouling {{behavior}} {{was investigated in}} the filtration of the multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite membrane and commercial polyethersulfone ultrafiltration (PES-UF) membrane. The effect of solution chemistry such as pH and ionic strength on the protein fouling mechanism was systematically examined using filtration model such as complete pore blocking, intermediate pore blocking and cake layer formation. The {{results showed that the}} initial permeate flux pattern and fouling behavior of the MWCNT composite membrane were significantly influenced by pH and ionic strength while the effect of PES-UF membrane on flux was minimal. In a lysozyme (Lys) filtration, the severe pore blocking in the MWCNT membrane was made by the combined effect of intra-foulant interaction (Lys-Lys) and electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and the foulant at pH 4. 7 and 10. 4, and increasing ionic strength where the foulant-foulant interaction and membrane-fouling interaction were weak. In a bovine serum albumin (BSA) filtration, severe pore blocking was reduced by less deposition via the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and foulant at pH 4. 7 and 10. 4 and increasing ionic strength, at which the interaction between the membrane and BSA became <b>weak.</b> For binary <b>mixture</b> filtration, the protein fouling mechanism was more dominantly affected by foulant-foulant interaction (Lys-BSA, Lys-Lys, and BSA-BSA) at pH 7. 0 and increase in ionic strength. This research demonstrates that MWCNT membrane fouling can be alleviated by changing pH condition and ionic strength based on the foulant-foulant interaction and the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and foulant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElevation of {{acetylcholinesterase}} enzyme (AChE) {{has been}} reported to be implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). One of the encouraged strategies to fight AD is the plant-derived inhibitors. Amaryllidaceae species are enriched source of alkaloids. The inhibitory properties of roots and bulbs of Pancratium maritimum L. against AChE have been previously reported. In the present study, the flowers of the wild Egyptian P. maritimum were subjected to screening assays to evaluate its potency as inhibitor to AChE. Besides, its antioxidant and cytotoxic properties were also addressed. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties of P. maritimum; total extract and its alkaloid mixture were examined using Ellman’s assay. The direct antioxidant examination was carried out using DPPH assay whereas the indirect was monitored by the ability to protect Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells against the induced cytotoxicity produced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The cytotoxic effect of the total extract and crude alkaloid mixture was evaluated against the human liver hepatoma cell line (HepG 2). P. maritimum flowers showed significant inhibitory activity against AChE. The potency of the alkaloid mixture, representing 5. 0 % of the flowers weight (IC 50; 22. 02 ± 0. 59 μg/ml) was about fourfold of its total extract (IC 50; 97. 67 ± 4. 06 μg/ml). The total extract was able to protect about 33. 4 % of Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 against the induced intoxication that carried by TBHP rather than the alkaloid <b>mixture.</b> <b>Weak</b> antioxidant and cytotoxic activities were recorded by both examined samples. Flowers of the Egyptian P. maritimum L. could be an enriched source of AChE inhibitors...|$|R
