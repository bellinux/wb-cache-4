The consensus states, [...] "Team America will either offend you or leave you in stitches. It'll probably do both." [...] The film also holds {{a rating of}} 64 out of 100 at Metacritic based on 38 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson {{was supposed to have}} met Parker before production, but they cancelled the meeting, acknowledging he would not like the film's expletives. Anderson saw the completed film and felt [...] "there are good, fun parts the film but the language wasn't to my liking." [...] National Review Online has named the film #24 in its list of [...] "The Best Conservative Movies". Brian C. Anderson wrote, [...] "the film's utter disgust with air-headed, left-wing celebrity activism remains unmatched in popular culture." [...] However, political and social commentator Andrew Sullivan considers the film brilliant in its skewering of both the left and right's approach on terrorism. Sullivan (a fan of Stone and Parker's other work, as well) popularized the term [...] "South Park Republican" [...] to describe himself and other like-minded fiscal conservatives/social libertarians. Parker himself is a registered Libertarian. In August, Internet news aggregator Matt Drudge blasted Paramount and the filmmakers for trying to [...] "mock the terror war." [...] A week later, the conservative group Move America Forward criticized the film, saying it was [...] "inconceivable" [...] that filmmakers would have spoofed the Nazis during World War II. In reality, many films mocking the Nazis were produced during the war, including Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Before Team America was released, statements were released by a [...] "senior Bush administration official" [...] condemning the film. Upon receiving the news, the duo called and found it was instead a [...] "junior staffer," [...] causing Stone to quip [...] "What is it - junior or senior? What are <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here?</b> Who knows? It might have been the janitor." [...] The two eventually decided it was free publicity, with which they were fine. Some media outlets interpreted the film's release on October 15 to be in theaters before the November elections. In reality, the release date {{had nothing to do with}} the elections; in fact, the film was intended to be released earlier, but production fell behind. Director Quentin Tarantino counted Team America: World Police in his list of top 20 films released since 1992, when his career as a filmmaker began.|$|E

40|$|Vaccination for village chickens? Cue: While the {{vaccination}} of poultry against {{diseases such as}} Newcastle disease is a standard practice on commercial farms, among village chicken keepers it is much less common. The reasons for this are not hard to guess. In the first place, vaccines tend to be expensive, and only available in large doses suitable for hundreds or even thousands of birds. Secondly, until recently Newcastle disease vaccines have needed to be kept at a low temperature {{in order to remain}} effective. This has meant that vaccination programmes have needed to maintain a cold chain, a system for keeping the vaccine cool, while being transported to villages, making the process much more difficult and expensive to manage. So how can an effective system for vaccinating village chickens be managed? That was the question that Chris Kakunta asked when he spoke to David Daka, Chief Animal Husbandry Officer at the Zambia Institute of Animal Health. IN:		?One of the diseases you are ? OUT:		?So you must feed well. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 22 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: David Daka of the Zambia Institute of Animal Health with some advice on village chicken rearing. Transcript Daka	One of the diseases you are looking at could be Newcastle disease, which can wipe almost 80 - 90 % of the flock, you lose everything. So this is the challenge. Kakunta	How can small scale farmers effectively manage a vaccination programme so that their chickens, village chickens do not die of Newcastle? Daka	Before I come to your question, we must know that Newcastle disease is a viral disease. Once birds are attacked, it means that there is no treatment, they just have to die. Those that survive will have problems in growth rates. So we must do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of Newcastle disease in our birds. But if it breaks out, the impact will be reduced if you did vaccinations. Now, for you to have an effective vaccination programme, when you have chicks which hatch, these should be vaccinated at three days old, and you can also give them another dose at six weeks. As they grow, and you hear about the outbreak of Newcastle disease here and there, you can continue vaccinating, but at three days, six weeks, eighteen weeks, you can vaccinate your birds. Kakunta	And what vaccines are <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here?</b> Daka	There are various types depending on the brands. Usually it looks like a tablet, you dissolve it. The most popular one is [administered] by drinking water. But the challenge in Newcastle vaccination, is that you have maintain a cold chain. You must not expose the vaccine to heat or sun rays, because you will destroy the vaccine and you will render it useless ? it loses its potency. But I understand there is a Newcastle vaccine which is stable under ambient temperature. It means you don?t need any cold chain, and this vaccine was established in Australia. We have tried to bring it, maybe it?s the cost, but it is the most effective vaccine. Anybody can carry it and mix it with water and vaccinate the chickens under normal temperature. As of now, what we do is, most of these vaccination campaigns for chickens is now thrown to the private sector. We have a lot of vets in Zambia; whoever wishes to vaccinate chickens, he can just buy the vaccine and they go in the villages and vaccinate. This is what we normally do. Kakunta	But this is a very expensive venture for an individual, Mr Daka. Daka	Unfortunately you have to invest for you to gain more. This is what we normally do. We have privatised our veterinary services, so we have invited most private vets to come on board and take up some of these clinical issues in our livestock sector. The only problem I see is that these doses, there may be in 1000 doses, it means you have to vaccinate 1000 chickens. So this is the problem, a farmer has got only maybe five chickens, but even then in the villages you can team up, you share the vaccine, you can vaccinate 1000 chickens. So it wouldn?t be expensive. Kakunta	Apart from protecting these birds against disease, what other important factors do you consider are paramount for successful raising of village chickens? Daka	You know, people complain that village chickens do not lay eggs during the rainy season. But somebody would assume that during the rainy season is when {{we have a lot of}} food. Unfortunately during the rainy season in this country we don?t have enough food for chickens. So my advice is that, when you are approaching the rainy season, like in November, farmers should keep enough maize bran, soya bean cakes, which they can mix to feed the chickens during the rainy season. They will be able to lay and grow and fatten, so that you don?t face any problem. Kakunta	And that can also be part of your prevention against diseases? Daka	Of course. A better fed animal will resist diseases. If your animal is not well fed, it is weak, the immunity goes down. Just like you, if you are not well fed whatever drug you may take it will not work in your body, because it is not complemented by good nutrition. So you must feed well. End of track.

40|$|Cue: Faced with {{unreliable}} {{rainfall and}} rising temperatures, farmers may feel powerless; their productivity seems {{to depend on}} forces beyond their control. But while the battle to maintain food production may be getting harder, {{it is not true}} that farmers have no power. Protecting and improving the quality of their soil, for instance, can {{have a major impact on}} crop yields, and can even help to compensate for low rainfall. In Zambia, the Programme Against Malnutrition(PAM) is currently advising farmers to practice what is called ?Conservation farming? as a way of protecting their fields from erosion and building soil fertility and water-holding capacity. This was just one of several strategies that Chris Kakunta learned about when he spoke to Hurrington Kanema, PAM?s Central Province co-ordinator. Hurrington begins by explaining some of the other ways that the organisation is helping farmers to cope with the changing climate. IN:		?One of the things that? OUT:		?made use of by the plants. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Hurrington Kanema of Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition. Transcript Kanema	One of the things that we are doing is that we are promoting crop diversification. We believe that with a wide range of crops being grown, farmers are able to cope with these dry spells, because then they plant a range of crops which are tolerant to different levels of moisture limitations. For example, we are trying to help farmers to plant a cereal crop, but also within those cereal crops, we try to encourage them to plant the short season varieties, say of maize or sorghum, which mature in a short period, so that even when we have a dry spell, farmers will have some food at the end of the season. Secondly we are trying to promote root and tuber crops. One of the crops we have been working on is cassava. In these areas where we are, in Central Province for example, cassava has not been a traditional crop, but now it has become necessary, because cassava is more drought tolerant, and once you plant it you are assured that you are going to have your food over a long period of time. In addition to that one of the other strategies we have embarked on is conservation farming. Farmers need to use methods which will help them grow crops even when there is very little moisture. Kakunta	And what methods are <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here?</b> Kanema	Some of the conservation methods we are using here, are the basins, as we can see these holes around here, so that moisture will be captured in these basins for a longer period. Kakunta	There are two types of holes I can see here. There are these smaller ones, and these bigger ones. Why are they so different? Kanema	What we call the basins are just dug-out small holes which they use for planting. And then there are what we call the ripped lines, the lines which are ripped with oxen. So farmers with work oxen, we encourage them to use the ripper: it?s faster, they can also cultivate a bigger area. You know when you dig these small holes with a hand hoe, it?s quite hard, there?s a lot of work involved. But with work oxen you are able to open up the furrows very early and be able to plant in these furrows. Kakunta	You mentioned that these holes are actually able to conserve some moisture. How exactly is that done? Kanema	What we do is when we open up these holes, they are about 15 cm deep, we then put in some manure, and they are covered and we leave just about 5 cm or so. So that when the rains come the farmers can plant, and water is captured in these holes. Because it has been dug, this area is very soft, so when it rains, the little water which falls goes straight into these holes, and it is stored in the soil, and it is made available to the seed which we are going to plant. So this moisture is not wasted, it does not just run off. So the idea of conservation is we are conserving not just the moisture, but also the nutrients. Kakunta	So in other words you are actually conserving the soils as well as helping the farmers cope with the changes in the weather? Kanema	That?s true. Because you see, the idea of conservation is that we are not ploughing the whole area; the farmer is just digging this place where he needs to put his seed. The rest of the land remains intact; the stubble or whatever is left in the field to add to the nutrients of the soil. So you are improving your soil. And in the long term you are also improving the structure of the soil so that it captures more moisture; the nutrients are there in the soil, that is why it is conservation farming. And in addition to that you improve the long term well-being of the farmer. They are able to get a better crop than when they are all the time ploughing. Most of the time you will see when they plough, when there is so much rain, the rain just washes away your soil, so there is a lot of erosion taking place because of that. But with an area like this, where they have not ploughed, they have just made holes where they plant, there is no run-off, very little run-off. The little water running off goes into these basins, and it is made use of by the plants. End of track. A co-ordinator for Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition explains methods of conservation farming which can help to conserve both soil moisture and nutrients in areas experiencing dry spells...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since {{a number}} of {{quantitative}} studies of pair programming (the practice of two programmers working together using just one computer) have produced somewhat conflicting results, {{a number of}} researchers have started to study pair programming qualitatively. While most such studies use coding schemes that are fully or partially predefined, we have decided to go the long way and use Grounded Theory (GT) to ground each and every statement we make directly in observations. The first intermediate goal, which <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>here,</b> was to produce a coding scheme that would allow the objective conceptual description of specific pair programming sessions independent of a particular research goal. The present article explains how our initial attempts at using the method of Grounded Theory failed and which practices we developed to avoid these difficulties: predetermined perspective on the data, concept naming rules, analysis results metamodel, and pair coding. We expect these practices be helpful in all GT situations, in particular those involving very rich data such as video data. We illustrate the operation and usefulness of these practices by real examples derived from our coding work and also present a few preliminary hypotheses regarding pair programming that we have stumbled across. ...|$|R

Whey is a byproductfrom cheese production. A first pilot remediation trial on an actual site in Gäddede,County of Jämtland, was started the summer of 2010. Using this site as a case study ascreening life cycle assessment model has been set up. The goal of the study was toinvestigate the environmental performance of the whey method, to benchmark the wheymethod toward the excavation and composting practice and to identify environmental hotspots in the whey treatment life cycle. The study aims at establishing if further work shouldbe put into developing the method, or if the environmental performance is such that the wheymethod should be abandoned.

I will paraphrase a definition that Rosenbaum borrows from the statistician William Cochran. Definition 1. 1 Observational Study. An observational study is an empirical investigation whose objective is to elucidate the cause-and-effect relationships involved and in which it is not feasible to use controlled experimentation, in the sense of imposing treatments or procedures whose effects want to be discovered, or to assign subjects at random to different treatments. So, an observational study has all the following features: (i) it concerns the study of an intervention, treatment, procedure, etc., (ii) it seeks to study the causal effect of this intervention on some outcome of interest and, very important, (iii) it is a study in which the assignment of treatments to subjects is not controlled by the experimenter. Observational studies are frequently contrasted with experiments. The main difference between an observational study and an experiment is that in the 1 latter the experimenter does control the assignment of treatments to subjects (and this assignmen...|$|R

Our purpose is to predict and anticipate the action of its competitor. <b>We</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> a context of reasoning under uncertainty. All existed works define the concept of competitive intelligence and propose a scheme for the competitive intelligence process and its stages, {{but there is no}} work, at the best of our knowledge, that touched the practical aspect of the field or developed a complete competitive intelligence solution that can be delivered to the decision maker, which makes the originality of our work. To motivate the research, we will address a competitive practical case in the field of telecommunications. In this paper we propose a competitive intelligence solution composed by two steps: actions association using k-modes algorithm which has the capability to deal with nominal data, and actions generation using rough set theory which has the capability to deal with inexact data and drive rules from it...|$|R

The idea for series was conceived during the time Doctolero did her research on Amaya. According to her, the series {{is a combination of}} Philippine history and Filipino mythology. The show's staged in pre-colonial to Spanish colonial period setting (1565-1663). Regarding the title [...] "Indio" [...] -which was a label intended to be a badge of imposed by the Spanish on the natives— Doctolero stated that [...] "It is the first word that comes into our minds when <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Spanish colonization <b>here</b> the Philippines. It mirrors every Filipino. With this series, I want to turn this label into something dignified and a source of pride." [...] GMA Network assigned Dondon Santos to helm the series. Santos is a former resident director of ABS-CBN and Indio is his very first project for GMA Network after he transferred and inked a contract with them.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{regulatory}} thought in the UK has not fitted the strict deregulatory and regulatory dichotomy and has taken a more mature approach that is apparent in the adoption of recommendations by the Better Regulation Task Force. Therefore, <b>we</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> a certain evolution. However, certain path dependence elements have still been present. Regulation has not been free from populist initiatives that occurred before this period, especially {{in the area of}} enforcement, nor from overreliance on previously successful solutions. An interesting aspect of regulatory initiatives adopted over this period is that they are both of an ‘integrative’ and ‘diffusive’ in character. It is difficult to speculate which theme has dominated. There are certain specific characteristics of regulation in the UK that have been preserved, but in general, regulation has often been consistent with regulatory themes in other countries, but not with academic thought. This has particular dynamics. Interestingly enough, whereas {{in the area of the}} environment, the UK could be considered as a pioneer, in terms of initiatives taken by organisations to which the UK is a party, regulatory steps have been rather reactive and minimal in scope.  </p...|$|R

In this context it is indispensable to evaluate {{the quality of the}} distorted mesh, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> the mesh visual quality (MVQ) assessment. Several works have tried to evaluate the MVQ using simple geometric measures, However this metrics do not correlate well with the subjective score since they fail to reflect the perceived quality. In this paper we propose a new objective metric to evaluate the visual quality between a mesh with a perfect quality called reference mesh and its distorted version. The proposed metric uses a chosen statistical distribution to extract parameters of two random variable sets, the first set is the dihedral angles related to the reference mesh, while the second set is the dihedral angles related to the distorted mesh. The perceptual distance between two meshes is computed as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two sets of variables. Experimental results from two subjective databases (LIRIS masking database and LIRIS/EPFL general purpose database) and comparisons with seven objective metrics cited in the state-of-the-art demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric in terms of the correlation to the mean opinion scores across these databases...|$|R

40|$|Carol Graham (2011) asks {{a really}} good question: does higher income go with greater {{happiness}} and, if so, under which conditions? It is perhaps difficult to under-estimate how central {{the answer to this}} question is to Social Science. In particular, if well-being is indeed relative in income, then greater GDP per capita will not necessarily raise average well-being in an economy. Somewhat less feted, yet to my mind just as important, is the fact that income comparisons of the kind that Carol Graham is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> have enormous implications for the analysis of individual well-being. In a nutshell, standard Economic analysis says that we will buy a good (or supply hours of work, or do whatever it is that we do) up until the marginal benefit from doing so, what we Economists call marginal utility, equals the marginal cost (the price of the good, or the value of the hour of leisure foregone). We typically think that such consumption is subject to the Law of decreasing marginal utility: the more of a good you have, the less you value having one more unit of it. This explains why we all, at some point, stop buying cars, eating ice cream, buying shirts, and earning income in general: the marginal utility from doing so just isn't worth the marginal cost we have to pay. All well and good, but the kinds of comparisons that <b>we</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> actually mount a serious challenge to this Law of decreasing marginal utility. If I compare to you, and you compare to me, then your buying an expensive car may increase my marginal utility of spending more on a new car. In general, my marginal utility of more income (or consumption) may rise with your income (or consumption). If this is the case, then your higher income will provide me with a greater incentive to increase my own income, which provides you with a greater incentive to increase your income, and so on ad infinitum. We are here then in the world of the rat race or the Arms Race. If I compare to you and you compare to me then the Law of decreasing marginal utility may well be weakened or indeed fail to hold at all. If so, we will all end up consuming too much, and not necessarily be any happier for it. Of course, the macroeconomic flipside of this is that greater income for all may not lead to greater happiness for all, as Dick Easterlin (1995) has pointed out. So these are very central questions indeed, from the points of view of understanding public policy and explaining individual consumption and labour-supply behaviours. 1 They are well-worth studying, and indeed have led to what is now a considerable literature across the social sciences...|$|R
5000|$|This is what Ukrainian {{music critic}} and {{journalist}} Oleksandr Yevtushenko wrote {{in one of}} his compilations on contemporary Ukrainian music:"I first heard the group OPALNYI PRYNZ on the broadcasts of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty. The songs Hey Ukraino!, Nash Prapor were played every day. That {{was at the end of}} the 1980s. But to find out anything about the group was only possible after the release of their first album Mandry. And after that as music of the [...] "secretive inhabitants of Lviv" [...] Ukrainian Radio started to play them and the became radio-hits. Rostyslav Shtyn and company came out into the information field. But they did not try to conquer it, because first and foremost they were concerned with the creation of a European level of musical infrastructure with their own agency, recording studio. What <b>we</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> is a well equipped national factory of stars. The idea didnt leave Rostyslav alone. Thank God, that he gathered his organizational skills and musical talent. First of all there was his musical education - Rostyslavs education is as a violinist. There was the persistent work with stars of multifarious stages. At the end of the 1980s the main matter became his group OPALNYI PRYNZ. It was created by: Yuri Shtyn (his younger brother), who plays keyboards, sings, and writes the music and lyrics, Toomas Vanem - lead guitar and still one other keyboardist Roman Brytsky and singer and guitarist Rostyslav Shtyn. The path of OPALNYI PRYNZ cardinally is different from generally accepted schemes. Because for they had the idea of technical and financial independence and perfect quality of how they sounded. The group signed a contract with one German producers centre and received the possibility of publishing its materials on both sides of the Iron Curtain. At the end of 1990 OPALNYI PRYNZ realizes its next project - the album Nova Revolyutsiya. Indisputably, all the tracks of the album are woven with the tectonic changes in the life of Ukrainian society. Its impregnated with movement towards freedom, the feeling of change. Concurrently it is beautifully recorded. And the video clip to the song Nash Prapor was shown on Ukrainian television all the way through to the year 2000. Some people confirm, that this clip was shown on MTV in honor of Ukraines declaration of independence in 1991. Nova Revolyutsiya - these are very strong and unique compositions Khlib po vodi (Bread upon the water), Rozmyti dorohy (Washed out roads), Ty na viyni (You are at war), Simnadtsyate veresnya (1939 The Seventeenth of September), Braty po zbroyii (Brothers in Arms). These are songs that one does not forget. Regardless of their primarily studio plane of existence, OPALNYI PRYNZ had a considerable influence on the formation of Ukrainian rock-music, certain models in their sound in particular, <b>we</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the synthesis of ethnic music with rock. It is possible that they were the first that did it delicately and convincingly. Its incredible, but OPALNYI PRYNZ even today sounds fresh and real." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} it would be crucial to have as many {{channels}} as possible to understand the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in nextgeneration collider experiments. A historic example of the parity violation and the V − A interaction is used to make this point. An e − e − option offers us a new channel in this respect. The usefulness of this channel is exemplified for the case of supersymmetry and of the strongly coupled EWSB sector. 1. Why are we here? So, here is another workshop on collider physics. Specifically on a rather exotic collider option, e − e − collider. Why are we doing this, after all? The answer to this question is quite simple. We believe that the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is the most pressing question in particle physics. And {{it is going to be}} a challenging task to completely reveal all secrets of EWSB. It will take substantial experimental and theoretical efforts to understand it. For this aim, having as many possible channels as possible will probably be necessary. Why multi-channel? We heard about the complementarity of hadron and lepton machines so many times. Maybe enough of it. And <b>we</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> yet another possible collider option. Why bother? I would like to remind you of an example in the history of particle physics where it was crucial to attack the same problem from many different channels. It is the V − A form of the charged-current weak interaction. a The first hint for parity violation came from a purely hadronic process.
