[...] Champe participated in the start of the expedition, and finally managed to escape several weeks later and return to Lee's unit. [...] Washington and Lee rewarded him richly, and convinced him to retire from military service so that he would not risk hanging {{for his role in the}} affair if he was captured.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1941 {{performances}} in Switzerland, Brecht believed critics had misunderstood the play. While many sympathized with Courage, Brecht's {{goal was to}} show that Mother Courage was wrong for not understanding the circumstances she and her children were in. According to Hans Mayer, Brecht changed the play for the 1949 {{performances in}} East Berlin to make Courage less sympathetic to the audience. However, according to Mayer, these alterations did not significantly change the audience's sympathy for Courage.
