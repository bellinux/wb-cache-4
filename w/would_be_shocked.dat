500|$|Although {{the lead}} player character, Martin Walker, was {{designed}} to be as simple as possible in order to help players to engage in the game, and relate to the character, the team gave him some personality which was expressed through his body language and his reactions during the game's battles. It was felt that by reflecting his emotions to players, they would share them. The squad was designed so that room was left for character development. The transformation of the squad's mentality serves as an important plot device during the game and has a significant narrative context. The changes in the cleanliness of their clothing, and their reactions toward each other, help to illustrate the story. According to Williams, the hope was that players would start the game with relatively low expectations, or they would consider the game another typical heroic war shooter, then by seeing the transformation of the characters, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> by the game's narrative and be [...] "engulfed by the darkness". To make the transformation process clear, the team found it necessary to show the characters' personality {{at the beginning of the}} game in order to create a strong contrast. Gameplay is also a plot device and is tied to the game's narrative, as players can choose whether or not to execute enemies, which reflects the brutality and horror of war.|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Chris <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> when he realises that Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich) [...] "may have a romantic interest in him." [...] During a charity camp-out, {{which has been}} organised by Scotty's girlfriend, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), Scotty visits Chris' tent and says something that makes Chris believe he is making a move on him. Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it. So he kicks Scotty out of the house, but even then Scotty doesn't realise what the kiss means." [...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it. However, they soon learn that Scotty has proposed to Georgia and decide to remain silent to stop her from having her heart broken.|$|E
2500|$|She {{declared}} {{recently that}} {{she followed the}} naming of the pen name of her favorite manga artist, Sensha Yoshida. His first name is just a name of an object like Ringo ("Sensha" [...] in this case meaning a [...] "tank" [...] in English). She thought that those who heard her name <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> by that.|$|E

5000|$|Karamoja was a 1954 film {{produced}} by exploitation filmmaker Kroger Babb. A documentary film {{of a native}} tribe from Uganda, the film was marketed by Babb {{to focus on the}} imagery that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocking</b> to an American audience, including advertising which claimed that the tribe wore [...] "only the wind and lived on blood and beer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "I don't {{know that there}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any <b>shock</b> that <b>would</b> hurt us, but we should have no air to breathe, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dark and dismal." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints commented: [...] "this {{decision}} {{represents only}} {{the opening of}} a vigorous debate over the rights of the people to define and protect this most fundamental institution – marriage..." [...] The Roman Catholic bishops of California stated: [...] "...the courts do {{not have the right to}} distort the meaning of marriage". National Organization for Marriage (NOM) chairman Maggie Gallagher also disagreed with the ruling. She targeted the judge's sexuality and accused Walker of [...] "substituting his views for those of the American people and of our Founding Fathers who I promise you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> by courts that imagine they have the right to put gay marriage in our Constitution". Brian Brown, President of NOM, complained of the [...] "biased way [...] conducted the trial." [...] Some critics have characterized the ruling as judicial activism. The American Family Association called for Walker's impeachment.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> and he sent me to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought to be done about it?" [...] Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims {{to produce}} a new album every {{eighteen}} months, and that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> if a new album did not come out in 2012. The band continues to record and produce new material even while touring. Bennington commented on Linkin Park's schedule, stating, [...] "Touring for two years is excruciating. When we would tour for two years even the most resilient person in the band, {{at the end of}} that, was fucking miserable." [...] He further elaborated on their ideas in an interview with MTV saying, [...] "We do have a really great head start. We've got some great music, some good ideas. The creativity has continued to flow for us for the last few years, consistently." [...] He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying [...] "We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time...we like the direction that we're going in." [...] Shinoda told Complex that they spent a year in making the album, as well as elaborating on the album's sound, saying that [...] "It doesn't lose any of the creativity of the newer stuff and it brings in the energy of the older stuff. It's kind of a comprehensive sound. I feel like we've been able to take all the stuff we've learned on the way and put it all together in each song and still keep it fresh and forward-thinking." [...] Shinoda told HitFix that the process of the album [...] "felt like a drug trip...we were looking to redefine everything." ...|$|E

30|$|Darwin was {{convinced}} of his solution to evolution’s puzzles {{long before he}} married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood. The question then was {{whether or not to}} tell her, and his father advised Darwin to conceal his feelings, but his anxieties grew, “not because he thought he was wrong about the origin of species, but because he felt sure he was right. He knew {{what he had to say}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocking</b> to Emma and others who believed God were the creator of all species,” (Heiligman 2009).|$|R
5000|$|If they're {{found to}} be true, it appears we've had a {{third-party}} individual have a really pernicious impact on a huge cross-section of student-athletes. The breadth of that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pretty <b>shocking.</b> NCAA president Mark Emmert ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I won't," [...] she said, {{turning back}} defiantly. [...] "I {{know what you}} are to say: that the Thrums people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> if they knew I was here; as if I cared what the Thrums people think of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you seem}} so stern. I <b>am</b> sure I <b>would</b> do {{anything}} I could to oblige you, if I knew how. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so <b>shocking</b> not to <b>be</b> {{good friends with}} a cousin like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said I, {{standing}} before {{her in the}} lovely light amid the dwelling dewdrops, [...] "really and truly, Mrs Bowater, it is only going back to its own again.

5000|$|Time in 2004 {{called it}} [...] "probably the best one-volume {{companion}} to the harrowing {{events in the}} war on terrorism since 1996", noting the book's scathing criticisms of the CIA. Houston Chronicle thought it was sometimes unfair to the Bush administration, but raised many troubling questions. Washington Report on Middle East Affairs noted its striking [...] "candor" [...] and revelations which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocking</b> for many Americans. Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times called it a [...] "damning portrait of the country's intelligence agencies" [...] and said [...] "Bamford's conclusions are alarming, if not unfamiliar".|$|R
60|$|No {{one was in}} the drawing-room but Captain Charteris, {{who came}} and shook hands with her {{as if they were}} old friends; but she was {{somewhat}} amazed at missing Mrs. Sandbrook, whose formality <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> by leaving her guests in the lurch.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Grice {{had some}} pity, and {{also knew that}} his wife and all the {{neighbours}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> at his prosecuting so young a boy, whose parents were in such distress.

60|$|But any {{adjustment}} {{must have}} its painful periods, and while Corliss's general change went on smoothly, {{in the particular}} case of Frona it was different.

60|$|<b>Would</b> the English <b>be</b> <b>shocked?</b> <b>Would</b> {{they feel}} outraged? <b>Would</b> they <b>be</b> amazed? <b>Would</b> {{they call the}} {{performance}} a desecration?

60|$|Of course all {{the pins}} were {{extracted}} {{in this second}} act of the play, and innumerable new and gaping wounds were introduced into the clothing, insomuch that all ordinary civilised people, except philanthropists, <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> {{with the appearance of}} the little ones.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{excessively}} severe--more {{severe than}} I choose to show you. You should hear the strictures with which I favour my 'beautiful young friend,' only that you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unutterably <b>shocked</b> at my want of tender considerateness for her delicate nature." ...|$|R

6000|$|But {{the things}} I {{did on the}} water only partly counted.

6000|$|... "You two need no introduction, of course," [...] the Baroness remarked. [...] "I am {{not going}} to tell you where I found Mr. Barnes.

6000|$|... "It is so sad," [...] added Lady Jane; [...] "I hoped {{we might}} have gone on so nicely together. And now I hope your Uncle Giles will not hear of it. He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so <b>shocked,</b> and never trust you again." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Canada v. Schmidt (1987), the Supreme Court {{found that}} {{government}} decisions to extradite people {{are bound by}} section 7.

[...] In determining what would shock the conscience, the Court said some elements of fundamental justice in Canada, such as the presumption of innocence, could be seen as [...] "finicky" [...] and thus irrelevant to extradition. [...] In contrast, the possibility of torture <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocking.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He half-expected {{that this}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shock</b> enough, and that Eppie {{would begin to}} cry. But instead of that, she began to shake herself on his knee, as if the {{proposition}} opened a pleasing novelty. Seeing that he must proceed to extremities, he put her into the coal-hole, and held the door closed, with a trembling sense that he was using a strong measure. For a moment there was silence, but then came a little cry, [...] "Opy, opy!" [...] and Silas let her out again, saying, [...] "Now Eppie 'ull never be naughty again, else she must go in the coal-hole--a black naughty place." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{readers of}} this essay are, I imagine, very largely {{composed}} of people who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> {{to be regarded as}} anything but enlightened Protestants.

We are not likely to believe in the miracles worked by the spolia of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, or by those of any other saints in the Roman Calendar." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{alderman}} looked greatly distressed. Ambrose {{threw himself}} on his knees before him, and in an agony entreated him to consent, assuring him that Master Randall could do what he promised. The alderman was much perplexed. He knew that his mother, who was confined to her bed by rheumatism, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> at the idea. He longed to accompany his daughter himself, but {{for him to be}} absent from the sitting of the court might be fatal to Giles, and he could not bear to lose any chance for the poor youths.|$|E
60|$|And {{then some}} big-brained person {{suggested}} the club idea, which stands alone {{as an example}} of American dry humour. There are now no boxing contests in New York. Swifty Bob and his fellows <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>shocked</b> at the idea of such a thing. All that happens now is exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club. It is true that next day the papers very tactlessly report the friendly exhibition spar {{as if it had been}} quite a serious affair, but that is not the fault of Swifty Bob.|$|E
