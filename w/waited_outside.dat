5|$|The {{service was}} {{attended}} by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff. Because the church could not hold the large crowd, thousands of mourners <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} a small producer, VAT had {{problems}} with unreliable deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers. Semi-finished lorries often <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the factory for engines or other key components. The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors. The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

5|$|On 11 or 12 May 1941, {{a band of}} Ustaše led by Puk {{seized a}} group of Serb males from Glina and {{detained}} them regardless of occupation or class. The Ustaše then herded the group into an Orthodox Church and demanded that they be given documents proving the Serbs had all converted to Catholicism. Two Serbs produced the required documents and were released. The Ustaše then locked inside and massacred {{those who did not}} possess conversion certificates, including priest Bogdan Opačić. The bodies were then left to burn as the Ustaše set the church on fire and <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. On 13 May, a further 100 Serb males were executed by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of New Yorkers, {{including}} many children, stood vigil outside {{the hospital in}} Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01p.m., Ruth died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His funeral Mass took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral; a crowd estimated at 75,000 <b>waited</b> <b>outside.</b> Ruth was buried on a hillside in Section 25 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. An epitaph by Cardinal Spellman appears on his headstone. His second wife, Claire Merritt Ruth, would be interred with him 28 years later in 1976.|$|E
5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view {{in a letter to}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E

5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had <b>waited</b> <b>outside.</b> These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Suenson <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the British zone of , but the Austrian-Prussian {{squadron}} {{was able}} to escape during the night to Cuxhaven, arriving at about 04:00 on 10 May. On reaching the port, the Austrian ships began {{to repair the damage}} sustained in the battle. Suenson sent his casualties ashore and resumed patrolling in the southern North Sea, between Heligoland and the Elbe. The day of the battle, the two sides had signed an armistice in London that took effect on 12 May, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The following day, a second Austrian squadron, which included the ship of the line Kaiser, the armored frigate Don Juan d'Austria, and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair arrived to reinforce Tegetthoff's ships. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port {{for the rest of the}} war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June.|$|E

25|$|At Munema Bodson and Bonchamps found a large guarded stockade {{surrounding}} a hundred huts and {{a maze of}} narrow alleys, with Msiri somewhere inside. Despite Bonchamps' protests about the danger, Bodson decided to go inside with just ten askari including a Dahomeyan and Hamadi-bin-Malum to find Msiri, while Bonchamps and the remaining askari <b>waited</b> <b>outside.</b> Bodson would fire his revolver if he needed assistance.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long {{motorcade}} {{traveled to}} Brentwood and the judge, jurors, prosecutors, and defense lawyers made a two-hour {{inspection of the}} crime scene. It {{was followed by a}} three-hour tour of O. J. Simpson's Rockingham estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear handcuffs; he <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his Rockingham house.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{ended on}} April 11. Medical teams from Canada, France, and Italy, {{as well as}} UN and ICRC officials, with trucks {{carrying}} supplies and water <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the camp for clearance to enter for days, but were denied entry, with Israel citing ongoing military operations. The first independent observers were granted access to the camp on April 16. Israeli troops began withdrawing from the camp itself on April 18. Tanks ringed {{the perimeter of the}} camp for a few more days, but by April 24, Israeli troops had withdrawn from the autonomous zone of Jenin.|$|E
25|$|The Athenian {{fleet of}} 180 ships {{caught up with}} Lysander shortly after he had taken Lampsacus, and {{established}} a base at Sestos. However, {{perhaps because of the}} need to keep a close watch on Lysander, they set up camp on a beach much nearer to Lampsacus. The location was less than ideal {{because of the lack of}} a harbor and the difficulty of supplying the fleet, but proximity seems to have been the primary concern in the minds of the Athenian generals. Every day, the fleet sailed out to Lampsacus in battle formation, and <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> the harbor; when Lysander refused to emerge, they returned home.|$|E

25|$|At Rugby Park, Hamilton (the site of today's Waikato Stadium), on 25 July, about 350 protesters {{invaded the}} pitch after pulling down a fence. The police arrested about 50 {{of them over}} a period of an hour, but were {{concerned}} that they could not control the rugby crowd, who were throwing bottles and other objects at the protesters. Following reports that a stolen light plane (piloted by Pat McQuarrie) was approaching the stadium, police cancelled the match. The protesters were ushered from the ground and were advised by protest marshals to remove any anti-tour insignia from their attire, with enraged rugby spectators lashing out at them. Gangs of rugby supporters <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> Hamilton police station for arrested protesters to be processed and released, and assaulted some protesters making their way into Victoria Street.|$|E
25|$|The barracks {{was being}} guarded by three patrolling sentries with two {{watching}} the wall facing the town while a third soldier guarded back wall covering approximately 100 yards. The raid {{was supposed to}} have taken place at the changing of the guard but O'Broin had trouble securing a lorry and was forced to steal one. This caused a three-hour delay and, at 3:30 am, Boyce and 15 other men scaled the wall while the rest <b>waited</b> <b>outside.</b> Three of the men were armed with knives, assigned to neutralise the sentry on duty, and broke away from Boyce's group once inside the base. They headed towards an archway where the soldier was to supposed take shelter, and when he did not, the three attacked him. Instead of using their knives, they instead attempted to merely knock him out using the butts of their revolvers.|$|E
25|$|Corporal {{punishment}} is prohibited in schools {{but it is}} still widely practiced. Both students (34%) and teachers (25%) reported corporal punishment by teachers and parents against girls in school. Apart from corporal punishment, mainly older boys beat up girls to harass and degrade them or in retaliation for a refusal to initiate a sexual relationship. Male students might snatch girls' school materials, intimidate them and threaten to harm them as a way of forcing them into sexual relationships. Parents could take girls' property as a disciplinary measure. School teachers were reported to humiliate and verbally abuse girls in class and this was worse if the girl was attractive. In the school community, girls most frequently suffered verbal abuse aimed at undermining their self-esteem. Other abuse involved touching private parts and punishment for refusing sexual requests. School girls might experience various forms of seduction before being subjected to sexually violent acts. This could be from school boys, teachers or rich sugar daddies who <b>waited</b> <b>outside</b> school gates.|$|E
