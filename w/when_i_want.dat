25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|In December 1977, {{following}} {{the production of}} the controversial play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want)</b> he co-wrote with Ngugi wa Mirii and the publication of his highly politicized novel Petals of Blood (1977), Ngũgĩ was imprisoned without trial or charges in Kamĩtĩ Maximum Security Prison by the authoritarian Kenyan regime. The play was performed in his native tongue Gikuyu in an open-air theatre in Limuru, with actors who were peasants and workers in the village. Both Petals of Blood and Ngaahika Ndeenda were openly critical of neocolonial life in Kenya, and they garnered Ngũgĩ a reputation with the Kenyan regime as a political dissident. Ngũgĩ was denied employment at the University of Nairobi upon his release, and he was imprisoned again in 1981 and 1982. He published several works while he was shifted in and out of imprisonment: Caitaani Mũtharaba-inĩ (Devil on the Cross), which he had written on toilet paper in prison, and Writers in Politics in 1981, and Detained, an account of his experiences in prison, in 1982.|$|E

500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?...

500|$|During the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go out, everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E

500|$|James Van Hise in {{his book}} The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, said that the episode [...] "fascinated" [...] him due to the [...] "experimental" [...] nature. He praised the {{direction}} of Frakes, who saved it from being a series of [...] "potentially boring repetition", adding that he [...] "clearly has a firm grasp on the series." [...] Juliette Harrisson listed [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] as the seventh most groundbreaking episode of the series in 2012 for Den of Geek. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, giving it a rating of nine out of ten. He praised the means in which Frakes made each repetition different, and the writing by Braga which he described as a [...] "tour de force". He said that [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] had [...] "the best teaser {{in the history of}} Star Trek", and summed it up by saying [...] "This is an absolute triumph of craft from both Braga and Frakes, and just a fun episode, with the added bonus of Captain Frasier Crane at the end. I almost didn't need to rewatch this one, as it's one of my go-to episodes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to watch a Star Trek episode for the heck of it, and I have yet to tire of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{political}} tone to his novels, including Petals of Blood, Ngugi had avoided government interference until deciding {{to write in}} his native Gikuyu. After the release of Petals of Blood, Ngugi wrote and began work on a Gikuyu language play called 'Ngaahika Ndeenda' (I Will Marry <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want).</b> He was then arrested and detained on 30 December 1977, for crimes relating to his [...] "literary-political" [...] background. After this period, all of his novels would be written first in Gikuyu and later translated into English, a move understood to be {{a conscious decision to}} focus more strongly on the peasant workers of Kenya as inspiration for his novels.|$|E
2500|$|Manga artist Yamada {{comments}} that [...] "there {{was so much}} love in Go Go Heaven (her previous series) that I got sick of it" [...] and created Versus as a [...] "stoic story of self-denial". She also {{comments that}} she focuses more on the hand and the backs of male characters when she draws them because they [...] "can tell more about the character's feelings than the faces, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to show that they}} are full of sadness or passion, I use that".

2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to think of a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).

2500|$|From January 1798 to March 1799, Zach {{was chief}} of staff of the Armee von Italien. He assumed the chief of staff role again from July 1799 to June 1800. On 9 June 1799 he {{received}} promotion to General-major. In a private letter to the Russian ambassador that was opened by the Austrian government, the army commander Alexander Suvorov described Zach as [...] "sound, discreet and professional, but a great deviser of Unterkunft (logistics) just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to burst into flaming action." [...] Though Suvorov used Unterkunft as a pejorative, Zach was tickled rather than insulted when shown the letter. Zach performed capably at the Battle of Novi on 15 August. For his actions, a grateful emperor awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 13 October 1799. A skilled mathematician, Zach was more at home in the field of military engineering than he was at combat leadership or in an operational role.|$|E

I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you.
