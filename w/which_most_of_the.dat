5|$|By 1980, {{the council}} {{identified}} land at Maidenbower, {{south of the}} Pound Hill neighbourhood, as being suitable for another new neighbourhood, and work began in 1986.

5|$|Production and {{planning}} {{of the film}} began in 1931 and Paramount expected the film to be released that same year. However, due to a film stock crisis in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures, the project was delayed for four years. The motion picture was released in American cinemas in January 1935.|$|E

5|$|Sinoceratops {{is known}} from the Xingezhuang Formation of {{southern}} China. It is known from skull material. Alongside it, in the formation, lived Shantungosaurus, a very common hadrosaurid to <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material has been assigned, Zhuchengtyrannus, an Asian tyrannosaurid related to Tarbosaurus, Zhuchengceratops, an Asian leptoceratopsid, and Huaxiaosaurus, a possible older individual of Shantungosaurus. Other possible remains have been assigned to Zhuchengosaurus, a probable junior synonym of Shantungosaurus, and material tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Sinoceratops was {{discovered}} in the Xingezhuang Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous. It lived alongside leptoceratopsids, saurolophines, and tyrannosaurines. The most common creature in the formation was Shantungosaurus, to <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material has been assigned. The animals living alongside Sinoceratops and Shantungosaurus were Zhuchengceratops, Huaxiaosaurus, and Zhuchengtyrannus.|$|E
5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval government's revenue {{was raised by}} levying taxes on {{moveable}} or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E

Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden has been removed.|$|E
5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E
5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E

5|$|In November 1909, Kenyatta {{left home}} and {{enrolled}} as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught {{to read and write}} in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British missionaries treated them.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{a native}} of {{northern}} England and his family was probably of Norse origin. He was a monk at Christ Church Priory, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury Cathedral; when he became a monk is unknown. In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the priory, and in that role was sent by the cathedral chapter to King Henry II of England to plead their case against Baldwin of Forde, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin's plan to found a collegiate church at Hackington in honour of Thomas Becket <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monks opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May SS-Standarte Deutschland, several {{kilometres}} to {{the west}} of the Zanddijk Position, approached the Canal through Zuid-Beveland, where the French 271e Régiment d’Infanterie was present, only partly dug in and now reinforced by the three retreated Dutch battalions. An aerial bombardment that morning routed the defenders before the ground attack had even started; the first German crossings around 11:00 led to a complete collapse. An attempt in the evening of the same day to force the eight hundred metres long Sloedam, over <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French troops had fled to Walcheren, ended in failure. On 16 May the island of Tholen was taken against light opposition; on 17 May Schouwen-Duiveland fell.|$|E

5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} vital parts of the Indian trade route was through the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java in the Dutch East Indies, through <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> China and East Indies trade passed on its journey to the Indian Ocean. French ships, both Navy {{warships}} and commercially owned privateers, operated along the Indian trade routes from their base at the isolated island of Île de France and recognised the strategic importance of the Sunda Straits. As soon as news of war arrived at Île de France French ships spread out into the Indian Ocean in search of British and Dutch merchant shipping, gathering in significant numbers off the Sunda Straits.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 2s {{financial}} success {{was a major}} factor in Sega catching up to Nintendo in the early-1990s console wars. It brought their market share up to 50% within six months of its release. Tails, whom Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduced, would go on {{to become one of the}} most prominent and frequently recurring characters in the series, appearing and acting as Sonic's sidekick in most of the franchise's media, including in recent games such as Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, and Sonic Lost World in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recurring cast does not appear or is relegated to minor roles. Furthermore, Sonic the Hedgehog 2s popularity managed to extend to various merchandise such as comic books (the well-received fortnightly Sonic the Comic), a television series, and a sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which received similar acclaim.|$|E

This was followed by a flat stage, after <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sprinters in the Giro withdrew from the race, as they did not figure to be in contention in the hilly and mountainous stages to follow.|$|E
5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried {{out most of the}} killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
