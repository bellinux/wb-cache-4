5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} <b>wildlife</b> <b>habitat</b> managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius). There may also be populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna <b>wildlife</b> <b>habitat</b> in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the gray wolf, coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears. Other large mammals include the bison (often referred to as buffalo), black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and cougar.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Berry became {{director}} of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, where he worked with Interior Inspector General Earl Devaney to reconcile twenty years of financial records, improve management, and conserve <b>wildlife</b> <b>habitat</b> through public-private partnerships. Berry was appointed from October 1, 2005, to serve as {{director of}} the National Zoo, which had been found to have shortcomings in record keeping and maintenance. Berry created a strategic planning and modernization process for the zoo. This included a twenty-year capital plan, securing $35 million in funding to provide for fire protection, and beginning renovations to animal houses.|$|E

5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and <b>wildlife</b> <b>habitat</b> in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting <b>wildlife</b> <b>habitat</b> in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E
