5|$|As a {{consequence}} of {{his role in the}} death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but <b>whenever</b> <b>she</b> leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{found the}} short skirt {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it {{against those who}} {{said it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause.
