500|$|In 1955, limited {{integration}} came to heavily segregated Las Vegas {{when the}} Sands first allowed Nat King Cole {{to stay at}} the hotel and perform. Sinatra noticed that he never saw Cole in the dining room, always eating his meals in solitude in his dressing room. When he asked his valet George to find out why, he learned that [...] "Coloreds aren't allowed in the dining room at the Sands". Sinatra subsequently saw to it that if blacks were not permitted to eat their meals in the dining room <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> he would see to it that all of the waiters and waitresses were fired, and invited Cole to dine with him the following evening. Cole was allowed permission into the casino, as was another black performer, Harry Belafonte, who took a more aggressive approach by walking into the casino on his own accord and sitting at a blackjack table, which was not challenged by the bosses. Belafonte became the [...] "first black man to play cards on the Las Vegas Strip".|$|E
500|$|Ryan Stiles won {{the role}} of [...] "hapless janitor" [...] Lewis Kiniski. Despite being well known for his role on the British improve show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Stiles still {{had to go through}} the {{audition}} process along <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> He said, [...] "I don't even think Drew was really even aware of Whose Line at that time because it hadn't been on the air (in the U.S.) that many years. I think it was only on Comedy Central at that time." [...] Stiles admitted that he liked to have fun with his character and not psychoanalyze him. Following his appearance in The Beverly Hillbillies, Diedrich Bader realised he needed a regular income and decided to return to television. He tested out for The Drew Carey Show, but did not initially want to be cast in it. He told Kevin Smith that he wanted to drive up his price for the pilot of Partners. Bader lost out on {{the role of}} Bob to Jon Cryer and then learned The Drew Carey Show wanted to hire him to play Oswald Lee Harvey.|$|E
2500|$|If {{there are}} [...] {{people who can}} shake hands with one another (where [...] ), the {{pigeonhole}} principle shows that {{there is always a}} pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to , there are [...] possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the [...] hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to shake hands <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves [...] people to be placed in at most [...] non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.|$|E

50|$|Two {{nights before}} the festival gig, Talisman played in Stockholm. Because of a {{miscommunication}} between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel {{and the guys}} doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) was left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s</b> gear down to Sölvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ow, if you please, don't!" [...] cried Tilly, {{throwing}} {{back her}} head, and bursting {{out into a}} howl--she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer. [...] "Ow, if you please, don't! Ow, what has everybody gone and been and done <b>with</b> <b>everybody,</b> making <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> so wretched? Ow-w-w-w!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Guderian {{was opposed}} {{by a number}} of {{officers}} in the Wehrmacht {{who did not want to}} see the scope of their own power and influence curtailed. Said Hermann Balck, who had worked with Guderian at the Inspectorate of Mobile Troops: [...] "Guderian was always in conflict <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> He was very hard to get along with, and it's a tribute to the German Army, as well as to Guderian's own remarkable abilities, that he was able to rise as high as he did within the German Army." [...] The primary area of resistance to Guderian came from the artillery branch. In an effort to curtail Guderian's influence, an adjective was added to his areas of oversight, changing the term [...] "assault guns", which was becoming an increasingly important source of firepower for the panzer divisions, to [...] "heavy assault guns", which was far more limited. The qualifier removed the Stug III, Wespe and Hummel from Guderian's authority, meaning that 90% of assault gun production, training and use would be beyond his influence.|$|E
60|$|On St. Andrew's Day {{every man}} in town wears a thistle and shakes hands <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> {{and you see}} the fine old Scotch honesty beaming out of their eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! Of course, it's absurd. But {{everybody}} seems to be tangled up <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> My dear, will {{you give me a}} cup of tea? I think I'll go to writing at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{performed}} last Christmas in a French piece, by Alexandre Dumas, I believe--"La Duchesse de Montefiasco," [...] {{of which}} I forget the plot, but everybody {{was in love}} <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> wife, except the hero, Don Alonzo, who was ardently attached to the Duchess, {{who turned out to}} be his grandmother. The piece was translated by Lord Fiddle-faddle, Tom Bulbul being the Don Alonzo; and Mrs. Roland Calidore (who never misses an opportunity of acting in a piece in which she can let down her hair) was the Duchess.|$|R
5000|$|She has conjectured that he {{intended}} to drown her, as she later discovered that [...] "the foil on my life jacket had been punctured and I hadn't checked my life jacket since I sailed <b>with</b> him. <b>Everybody</b> <b>else's</b> lifejackets were fine. So I have pretty much no doubt that the boat was the way it was going to go." ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{nights before}} the festival gig, Talisman played in Stockholm. Owing to a {{miscommunication}} between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel {{and the guys}} doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) was left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s</b> gear down to Sölvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place.Marcel wanted to leave the festival but, after looking inside the tent which was fully packed with a crowd shouting for Talisman, {{he decided not to}} turn his back on those people. So Marcel and other people started to run around the festival area to look for a bass to be borrowed in time for the show: Magnus Rosén from HammerFall finally lent Marcel one of his bass guitars.|$|R
60|$|John {{had been}} trudging all day from point to point, only {{to hear the}} old story: times were hard, work was dull, nobody wanted him, and he felt morose and surly--out of humor with himself and <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{was to be}} expected, the parting {{between the}} boys and the girls was a rather {{prolonged}} affair, and {{it looked as if}} everybody was highly pleased <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> But at last Annie Larkins looked at a wrist watch she wore and gave a little shriek.|$|E
6000|$|... "O 'Manda, 'Manda!" [...] Statira {{took her}} medicine, and then wildly flung her arms round 'Manda Grier's neck, {{and began to}} sob and to cry there.

5000|$|Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or {{a credit}} card, is what museums are for, {{and because the}} British Museum has {{collected}} things {{from all over the}} globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be [...] "a" [...] history of the world, not [...] "the" [...] history. When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, but I think what they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be <b>with</b> me, because <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is happy, {{and this}} is the happiest time of all the year. I wish some one would tell me what ails me. I want to be happy, but somehow I just can't be." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{incident}} {{put an end}} to the evening's enjoyment but as {{the greater}} part of it had already passed delightfully before Thomson came on the ground to mar the sport, the children returned home much pleased <b>with</b> themselves and <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> despite the concluding scene.|$|R
60|$|All right! He {{would show}} them! Squaring his shoulders, he crossed {{his legs and}} gazed inscrutably at his spats. But just then an 'old Johnny' in a gown and long wig, looking awfully like a funny raddled woman, came through a door into the high pew opposite, {{and he had to}} uncross his legs hastily, and stand up <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There's husbands in the world," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Glegg, after a pause, [...] "as 'ud {{have known}} how {{to do something different}} to siding <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> against their own wives. Perhaps I'm wrong and you can teach me better. But I've allays heard as it's the husband's place to stand by the wife, instead o' rejoicing and triumphing when folks insult her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this," [...] {{answered}} Ned, {{as he put}} {{the finishing}} touches to his sketch, [...] "that whereas we claim only {{the right to do}} to and with ourselves what we please, you Yankees claim the right to do to and <b>with</b> <b>everybody,</b> <b>else</b> what you please. I have no objection whatever to your spitting, but I do object to your spitting over my shoulder." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{represented}} {{a departure from}} the band's previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed {{to the development of the}} songs, Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter. On Love Kraft this was no longer the case, as Rhys, Huw Bunford, Dafydd Ieuan and Cian Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals. The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit, instead choosing tracks that would work well together and [...] "create a sound that was as cohesive as possible". Of the [...] "30-40" [...] songs written by band members the group chose [...] "the more introspective ones" [...] which meant that some of Rhys's tracks were left off the album as they were [...] "energetic and poppy" [...] and [...] "didn't really fit in <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> work".|$|R
500|$|Lin is {{an evangelical}} Protestant, {{and was a}} leader in Harvard's Asian American Christian Fellowship during his time there. He {{credited}} his NBA success to playing without pressure. [...] "I've surrendered that to God. I'm not in a battle <b>with</b> what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> thinks anymore," [...] said Lin. He hopes to become a pastor who can head up non-profit organizations, either home or abroad, and has talked of working in inner-city communities to help with underprivileged children.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; upon my word!" [...] cried Lottie. [...] "If Ellen {{can talk}} {{by the hour}} with that {{precious}} Mr. Breckon, and stay up here along <b>with</b> him, when <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is down below sick, I don't think she can {{have a great deal}} to say about a half-grown boy like that being introduced to me." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after that}} Silverbridge and Popplecourt came in. If {{the story of}} the old woman in the {{portrait}} may be taken as evidence of a family connexion between Lady Cantrip and Lord Popplecourt, everybody there was more or less connected <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> Nidderdale had been a first cousin of Lady Glencora, and he had married a daughter of Lady Cantrip. They were manifestly a family party,--thanks to the old woman in the picture.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Lady Lufton {{has been}} {{asking you to}} lecture me about it?" [...] Poor Mrs. Robarts hardly knew what to say. She thought well of all the persons concerned, and was very anxious to behave well by all of them;--was {{particularly}} anxious to create no ill feeling, and wished that everybody should be comfortable, and on good terms <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> But yet the truth was forced out of her when this question was asked so suddenly. [...] "Not to lecture you, Lucy," [...] she said at last.|$|E
60|$|The clergymen, {{relieved}} of their nautical duties, shone out brightly as good-humored and agreeable companions. Their hardships and their dangers {{had made them}} so well acquainted with each other, and <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> on board, and they had found it so easy to become acquainted with Captain and Mrs. Horn, and they all felt so much relieved from the load of anxiety which had been lifted from them, that they performed well their parts in making {{up one of the}} jolliest companies which ever sailed over the South Atlantic.|$|E
60|$|Mr Pogram {{shook hands}} <b>with</b> him, and <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> once more; {{and when they}} came back again at five minutes before eight, they said, one by one, in a melancholy voice, 'How do you do, sir?' and shook hands with Mr Pogram all over again, {{as if he had been}} abroad for a twelvemonth in the meantime, and they met, now, at a funeral.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pardiggle {{came one}} {{day for a}} {{subscription}} to something, and with her, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to us; and {{just as he had}} drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared Mr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at first sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr. Quale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great creature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale meant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale's mission to be in ecstasies <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> mission and that it was the most popular mission of all.|$|R
5000|$|Mandel commented in 2011 {{that he has}} {{struggled}} with the condition since childhood, but did not seek help until he was an adult: [...] "I don’t {{remember a time when}} I didn’t feel there was an issue. But I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. I’ve always felt a little bit different, and I always knew I wasn’t as comfortable <b>with</b> life as <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> seemed to be. But I didn’t know what I could do about it. When I was a kid, I didn’t know anybody who went to a psychiatrist. There was always a stigma attached to mental health issues. I think there still is. But now I’m taking care of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With Mr. Wolf, as {{with all}} the other animals, life was an easy matter at first. There was plenty to eat, and {{everybody}} was on good terms <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> But there came a time, as you know, when food became scarce. It was then that the big learned to hunt the small, and fear was born into the world. Mr. Wolf was swift of leg and keen of nose. His teeth were long and sharp, and he was so strong that there were few he feared to fight with. In fact, he didn't know fear at all, for he simply kept {{out of the way of}} those who were too big and strong for him to fight.|$|E
60|$|The next {{of which}} a vision has come to me {{is one of a}} {{somewhat}} similar house to our own in Aar, upon an island called Lesso, where we were all visiting a chief of the name of Athalbrand. He was a fierce-looking man with a great forked beard, from which he was called Athalbrand Fork-beard. One of his nostrils was larger than the other, and he had a droop in his left eye, both of which peculiarities came to him from some wound or wounds that he had received in war. In those days everybody was at war <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> and it was quite uncommon for anyone to live until his hair turned grey.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{those days}} Miner's great-great-grandfather a {{thousand}} times removed didn't live under ground," [...] continued Grandfather Frog. [...] "Nobody did. He wasn't so very different {{from a lot of}} other animals. Food was plenty, and everybody was on the best of terms <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> Mr. Mole lived just as the rest did. He went and came as he pleased, and enjoyed the sunshine and took part in all the good times of his neighbors. Everybody liked him, and whenever he made a call, he was sure of a welcome. But one thing Mr. Mole never did; he never meddled in other people's affairs. No, Sir, Mr. Mole never poked his nose in where he had no business.|$|E
60|$|The {{smattering of}} science that all--even doctors--pick {{up from the}} {{ordinary}} newspapers nowadays only makes the doctor more dangerous than he used to be. Wise men used to take care to consult doctors qualified before 1860, who were usually contemptuous of or indifferent to the germ theory and bacteriological therapeutics; but now that these veterans have mostly retired or died, we are left {{in the hands of}} the generations which, having heard of microbes much as St. Thomas Aquinas heard of angels, suddenly concluded that the whole art of healing could be summed up in the formula: Find the microbe and kill it. And even that they did not know how to do. The simplest way to kill most microbes is to throw them into an open street or river and let the sun shine on them, which explains the fact that when great cities have recklessly thrown all their sewage into the open river the water has sometimes been cleaner twenty miles below the city than thirty miles above it. But doctors instinctively avoid all facts that are reassuring, and eagerly swallow those that make it a marvel that anyone could possibly survive three days in an atmosphere consisting mainly of countless pathogenic germs. They conceive microbes as immortal until slain by a germicide administered by a duly qualified medical man. All through Europe people are adjured, by public notices and even under legal penalties, not to throw their microbes into the sunshine, but to collect them carefully in a handkerchief; shield the handkerchief from the sun in the darkness and warmth of the pocket; and send it to a laundry to be mixed up <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> handkerchiefs, <b>with</b> results only too familiar to local health authorities.|$|R

6000|$|This reply {{seems to}} have gratified the lurking jealousy of Boswell, and he has {{recorded}} it in his journal. Johnson, however, with respect to Goldsmith, and indeed <b>with</b> respect to <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> blew hot as well as cold, according to the humor he was in. Boswell, who was astonished and piqued at the continually increasing celebrity of the poet, observed some time after to Johnson, {{in a tone of}} surprise, that Goldsmith had acquired more fame than all the officers of the last war who were not generals. [...] "Why, sir," [...] answered Johnson, his old feeling of good-will working uppermost, [...] "you will find ten thousand fit to do what they did, before you find one to do what Goldsmith has done. You must consider that a thing is valued according to its rarity. A pebble that paves the street is in itself more useful than the diamond upon a lady's finger." ...|$|R
