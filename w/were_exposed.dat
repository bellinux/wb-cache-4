The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A {{number of animals}} died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E

5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to an absorbed dose of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July.

By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert.

5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E

Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> during Theobald's time in office.

Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E
