5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> joke as the episode ends.|$|E

500|$|I {{really started}} second-guessing myself. And then I realized, like, all right, I {{have to go}} with my gut. Because everybody's got an opinion, and so many people's {{opinions}} about me are like polar opposites. They're like, 'We love it when she does ballads, make her do the ballads.' Then they're like, 'We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean? I'm like, 'Stay in your lane, and I'll figure it out.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Since his death, Twitty's son Michael and {{grandson}} Tre {{have been}} carrying on his musical legacy. His most recent {{appearance on the}} country charts was a duet with Anita Cochran, [...] "(I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hear)</b> <b>A</b> Cheating Song" [...] (2004), which {{was made possible by}} splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and even interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like to the electronic duets of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, Hank Williams and Hank Williams, Jr. or Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole, Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocal.|$|E
2500|$|Cohan {{became one}} of the leading Tin Pan Alley songwriters, {{publishing}} upwards of 300 original songs noted for their catchy melodies and clever lyrics. His major hit songs included [...] "You're a Grand Old Flag," [...] "Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway," [...] "Mary Is a Grand Old Name," [...] "The Warmest Baby in the Bunch," [...] "Life's a Funny Proposition After All," [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>a</b> Yankee Doodle Tune," [...] "You Won't Do Any Business If You Haven't Got a Band," [...] "The Small Town Gal," [...] "I'm Mighty Glad I'm Living, That's All," [...] "That Haunting Melody," [...] "Always Leave Them Laughing When You Say Goodbye", and America's most popular World War I song [...] "Over There", which was recorded by Enrico Caruso among others. The latter song reached such currency among troops and shipyard workers that a ship was named [...] "Costigan" [...] after Cohan's grandfather, Dennis Costigan. During the christening, [...] "Over There" [...] was played.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout their career, Die Ärzte {{have often}} been {{compared}} to fellow German punk band Die Toten Hosen; a comparison that has often been stylized as a rivalry by the media despite both bands never having an official feud. The comparisons are mostly drawn because of a similar origin as both bands were pioneers of the German punk rock scene and started {{around the same time}} in the early 1980s, in both cases evolving from earlier locally famous punk bands (Die Ärzte from Soilent Grün and Die Toten Hosen from ZK). Furthermore, both bands are heavily linked to their cities of origin: Die Ärzte from Berlin and Die Toten Hosen from Düsseldorf. While Die Ärzte are known as the first famous Fun Punk band of Germany, Die Toten Hosen also have a bunch of humorous songs, mostly about alcoholism. Both bands enjoyed a similar curve of success (with the most notable difference being the 5-year hiatus of Die Ärzte). Due to all these similarities multiple media outlets in Germany tried to establish a Beatles/Stones-style rivalry between both bands even though both bands are amicable towards each other if not poking fun at said [...] "rivalry". Adopting aliases Die Ärzte and Die Toten Hosen have played small club shows together in the past. In 2012 Die Toten Hosen even covered Die Ärzte's Schrei nach Liebe on the bonus disc for their album Ballast der Republik. The same year, they covered the song while headlining Germany's biggest rock festival Rock am Ring. Poking fun at the two bands sometimes being confused, Die Toten Hosen frontman Campino said that [...] "maybe the people just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> good song this time".|$|E

She wanted to marry so that her plans might be settled before her father and his new wife arrive; and now she considers that they are settled. So be careful. It is true that the objections she formerly had to you are removed, but before you ask her to marry you, you should seriously ask yourself what reason there is she should do so. She does not know you very well; she is not interested in you; and I am very sure she is not in love with you. Now you know, for I have told you so, that I would be delighted to see you two married. I believe you would suit each other admirably, but although you may agree with me in this opinion, I am quite sure she does not; at least, not yet. Now, this is all I am going to say, except that you have my very best wishes that you may get her." ...|$|E
