25|$|The {{government}} {{launched a}} voluntary evacuation program in December 1943 which encouraged old people, {{children and their}} mothers {{to move from the}} main cities and stay in the homes of friends and relatives in rural areas. The government provided civilians with little assistance to evacuate, however. Few people evacuated until the first raid by American heavy bombers on Japan, an attack on Yawata, in June 1944 after which the government urged families to evacuate their children. As a result, 459,000 children and their parents moved to stay with friends and relatives. For families <b>without</b> <b>contacts</b> in the countryside, entire school classes evacuated as groups accompanied by their teachers; by August 1944, 333,000 children had been relocated to rural areas where they continued their education in inns, temples and other public buildings. A further 343,000 urban residents were forced to leave their homes when they were destroyed to create firebreaks; these people either moved to the country or lived in temporary accommodation near their workplace.|$|E
500|$|According to a belief, {{the power}} of dragon boys was {{greatest}} {{at the time of}} their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Niš that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, [...] "takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases." [...] The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Župa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Župa that the dragon men lived alone, <b>without</b> <b>contacts</b> with other humans.|$|E

40|$|Tear {{analysis}} in contact lens wearers was compared with tear {{analysis in}} aphakics <b>without</b> <b>contact</b> lens wear and normal phakic patients. Subjects {{were divided into}} five groups: group 1, aphakic <b>without</b> <b>contact</b> lens; group 2, phakic with daily-wear hard contact lens; group 3, phakic with daily-wear soft contact lens; group 4, phakic with extended-wear soft contact lens; and group 5, aphakic with extended-wear soft contact lens. The experimental groups were compared with age- and sex-matched control groups for statistical analysis of tear variables {{by means of the}} Student's t-test. The variables measured were tear osmolarity, tear albumin, and lysozyme and lactoferrin concentrations in basal and reflex tears. Highly significant elevations of tear osmolarity were found in aphakic subjects <b>without</b> <b>contact</b> lenses. Less significant differences in tear osmolarity were found in phakic subjects with hard daily-wear lenses or with extended-wear soft lenses. Tear albumin, lysozyme, and lactoferrin in basal and reflex tears were not significantly different in the different groups of contact lens wearers or in the group of aphakic subjects <b>without</b> <b>contact</b> lenses compared with their control groups. Individual variations in tear albumin, lysozyme, and lactoferrin appeared to be responsible for the inability to demonstrate significant differences in tear composition in association with the wearing of different types of contact lenses. Older and aphakic patients demonstrated a tendency to have increased concentrations of proteins in the tears compared with younger, phakic contact lens wearers and normal controls <b>without</b> <b>contact</b> lenses...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778 Erskine was awarded a degree and was called to the Bar on 3 July. While many newly {{qualified}} barristers, especially those <b>without</b> <b>contacts</b> to put briefs their way, took years to establish themselves, Erskine's success was immediate and brilliant. His first case, that of Thomas Baillie, came to him by chance. The case involved the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen, of which Captain Baillie was lieutenant-governor. Baillie had uncovered abuses {{in the management of}} the hospital and, having failed to interest the directors and governors of the hospital or the lords of the Admiralty, he published a pamphlet and was then sued by the agents of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich who was first lord of the Admiralty and had been placing his agents in positions of authority in the hospital. Hearing of a newly qualified barrister who had himself been a seaman and was sympathetic to his cause, Baillie appointed Erskine to his team although he already had four counsel. Erskine was the most junior, but it was his brilliant speech that won the case and exonerated Baillie. Despite a warning from the judge, Erskine attacked Lord Sandwich calling him [...] "the dark mover behind the scene of iniquity". After his success in the Baillie case, Erskine had no shortage of work and a few months later was retained by Admiral Augustus Keppel in his court martial at Portsmouth. Keppel was acquitted and gave Erskine £1,000 in gratitude. For {{the first time in his}} life Erskine was financially secure.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} response of a double-barrier conductor with two contacts {{to investigate the}} contact effect on ac conduction in the system. We have presented the calculation of various physical quantities such as the distributions of internal potential and charge density, capacitance and low-frequency ac conductance. We show that the characteristic potentials would tend to unity (zero) in the reservoirs. When the system is far away from resonance, the charge distribution exists only around the barrier regions {{as a response to}} the applied voltage, and hence the contacts almost have no effect on the results. In the case of small transmission probability, we find a considerable amount of charge distribution surrounding the double-barrier conductor. As for the resonant case or near the resonance, our results show that the charge distribution displays large fluctuations outside the conductor, but almost no charge distribution within the conductor. In this case, the effect of contacts on the charge and potential distributions is considerable. Moreover, we find that qualitatively the presence of contacts does not change the main features of the emittance <b>without</b> <b>contacts.</b> But the contact effect on the capacitance is significant when the chemical potential is very close to resonant energy: there is a sharp capacitance peak at resonance that does not exist in the case <b>without</b> <b>contacts.</b> Department of Building Services EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: W.
