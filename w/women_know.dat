500|$|Before her death, Rückerschöld {{would write}} two more {{books on the}} topic of {{housekeeping}} and cooking: Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök, ("Poor Man's Larder and Kitchen") and En Liten Hushålls-Cateches ("A Small Household Catechism"). The first book was published in 1796, and [...] aimed for a broader readership than the previous books. This included not just modest urban households, but also peasant wives who made up {{the majority of the population}} in Sweden at the time. Again Rückerschöld stressed the importance that <b>women</b> <b>know</b> proper housekeeping skills, and urged them to take good care of the household economy to keep incompetent husbands from wrecking the family budget. Other than directions for simple dishes, there was money-saving strategies like baking one's own bread or cooperating with neighbors to buy larger quantities of food at lower prices. In the book Rückerschöld portrays herself as going on inspection in a peasant household, being shown the barn, larder, vegetable garden, etc., and having suggestions for improvements everywhere. Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök was awarded a silver medal by Patriotiska Sällskapet ("The Patriotic Society") for being the first cookbook written for poorer households. Twenty years earlier, the society had issued a challenge with this aim, but no one before Rückerschöld had managed to write such a book. In 1797, one year after the book was first published, a second edition came out.|$|E
500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of home and work responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds anger and frustration, as <b>women</b> <b>know</b> they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E

2500|$|As more Iranian {{girls were}} being {{educated in the}} 1980s, and the {{government}} opened higher religious education to women, some mastered technical forms of Islamic argumentation which helped {{in the fight for}} the liberalization of women’s rights. Furthermore, many women became successful entrepreneurs, and worked in other highly visible professions including parliament. As stated in an interview in 1996, prominent secular lawyer Mehrangiz Kar stated “The revolution gave women confidence in themselves. With all the sacrifices they made, Iranian <b>women</b> <b>know</b> how much their current and future rulers owe to them. This demand is no longer that of a group of women; it is a nationwide one. The Islamic government cannot escape it without risking a brutal separation of the state and religion.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Serving as the album's most radio-friendly track, [...] "Ice Cream" [...] was {{released}} September 25, 1995, with [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces" [...] as its B-side.

The song uses different flavor variants of ice cream as a metaphor for different races of women. Raekwon later commented [...] "we wanted to reach out and let the <b>women</b> <b>know</b> that we respected them as queens. And queens, much like ice cream, come in all different flavors." [...] The song marks the second appearance of Cappadonna on the album, and serves as his break-through performance, as it would give him commercial exposure.
