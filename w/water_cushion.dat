5000|$|Although {{the trip}} on the Ohio River had been largely {{peaceful}} and easygoing, {{the passage of the}} Mississippi River was to be fraught with danger and uncertainty. As the New Orleans passed the mouth of the Tennessee River, the crew saw Chickasaw Indian warriors, but experienced no violence. While fighting continued north of the Ohio River through the War of 1812, the Chickasaws remained peaceful allies of the Americans and declined to join forces with great warrior and chief, Tecumseh. Later, a fire broke out aboard ship after wood was left too close to the stove during the night, but it was quickly extinguished. Then, in mid-December, {{the first in a series}} of earthquakes struck the area, but the river's <b>water</b> <b>cushioned</b> the New Orleans, allowing it to continue, undamaged by the quakes. On December 15, the famous New Madrid earthquake, which centered near New Madrid, Missouri, became one of the strongest North American earthquakes ever recorded; seismologists estimate it was an 8 on the modern Richter scale. The earthquake affected the journey by altering Mississippi River landmarks such as river islands and river channels that confused the pilot's visual navigation. At some small river towns, villagers begged to be taken aboard to escape the earthquake's desolation, but the New Orleans lacked the provisions to feed the refugees and would have no more available until the boat reached Natchez, Mississippi, in late December 1811. At Natchez the crew met Zadok Cramer, author of the [...] "Navigator" [...] river guide, who was eager for any new information about the geography of the river. Continuing on, the boat reached New Orleans on January 10, 1812. Following the trip, Roosevelt and his family returned to New York, where he took up other entrepreneurial ventures and discontinued his partnership with Fulton and Livingston.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a laboratory set of experiments made to investigate the pressure fluctuation field on beneath of a plunge pool subjected to jet impingement. As an example this phenomenon takes commonly place {{in the case of the}} drop structure, where the elevation reduces with a take off and impinging portion. When the downstream bottom is nearly horizontal and made of concrete or rock, there is no significant scour, and the drop is followed by a stilling basin where the hydraulic jump takes place. The relevance of the topic is related to the structural design of the linings of the dissipation basin downstream barrages or check dams. Nevertheless the knowledge of the stresses at the basis of plunge pool dissipation basins can be useful to predict a localized erosion process. With reference to the specific case of the prototype of a dam spillway and downstream energy dissipation basin, we discuss the effect of a variable <b>water</b> <b>cushion</b> depth on the reduction of the severe pressure fluctuations that take place at the bottom of the stilling basin.

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{introduction}} of new lithotripters has increased problems associated with shock wave application. Recent studies concerning mechanisms of stone disintegration, shock wave focusing, coupling, and application have appeared that may address some of these problems. OBJECTIVE: To present a consensus {{with respect to the}} physics and techniques used by urologists, physicists, and representatives of European lithotripter companies. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We reviewed recent literature (PubMed, Embase, Medline) that focused on the physics of shock waves, theories of stone disintegration, and studies on optimising shock wave application. In addition, we used relevant information from a consensus meeting of the German Society of Shock Wave Lithotripsy. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Besides established mechanisms describing initial fragmentation (tear and shear forces, spallation, cavitation, quasi-static squeezing), the model of dynamic squeezing offers new insight in stone comminution. Manufacturers have modified sources to either enlarge the focal zone or offer different focal sizes. The efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can be increased by lowering the pulse rate to 60 - 80 shock waves/min and by ramping the shock wave energy. With the <b>water</b> <b>cushion,</b> the quality of coupling has become a critical factor that depends on the amount, viscosity, and temperature of the gel. Fluoroscopy time can be reduced by automated localisation or the use of optical and acoustic tracking systems. There is a trend towards larger focal zones and lower shock wave pressures. CONCLUSIONS: New theories for stone disintegration favour the use of shock wave sources with larger focal zones. Use of slower pulse rates, ramping strategies, and adequate coupling of the shock wave head can significantly increase the efficacy and safety of ESWL...|$|E

To ensure a sufficient safety evaluation in terms of erosion (scour) formation {{at the bottom of the}} plunge pool, pressure simulations in the plunge pool floor in an experimental model at the Department of Hydraulic Engineering in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China has been performed. Data from two experiments with two different outflow configurations has been obtained and analyzed together with three earlier performed experiments on the same experimental model.

The results retrieved from the other experiments however showed the importance of a spillway design with nappe splitters and nappe blocks implemented and the value of a sufficient <b>water</b> <b>cushion</b> in the plunge pool. All four outflow configurations with nappe splitters or nappe blocks implemented held a hydrodynamic pressure below the recommended maximum pressure value of 15 cm water head (experimental model scale) stated by the East Asian Investigation and Design Institute, whilst the one configuration with no nappe splitters or nappe blocks exceeded the value. The design of outflow configuration two is four nappe splitters implemented in two spillways and two nappe blocks in two spillways. In this thesis, this configuration has proven to be the most suitable one in terms of maximum pressure minimization and pressure distribution at the plunge pool floor. ...|$|E

The results were compared with those of 17 obese patients (Group B) with similar baseline characteristics treated in the standard supine position. All ESWLs were performed using the Dornier lithotripter SII. Both success rate (68. 4 vs. 64. 7 % for groups A and B, respectively) and mean number of sessions (2. 2 vs. 2. 6) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0. 5). Interestingly, the time required to complete ESWL was significantly shorter for group A patients (56 min) compared to group B (73 min) (p = 0. 001).

40|$|International {{audience}} Recent {{experimental and}} theoretical {{work on the}} dynamics of submarine debris flows is summarized. Hydroplaning was first discovered in laboratory flows and later shown to likely occur in natural debris flows as well. It is a prime mechanism for explaining the extremely long runout distances observed in some natural debris flows even of over-consolidated clay materials. Moreover, the accelerations and high velocities reached by the flow head {{in a short time}} appear to fit well with the required initial conditions of observed tsunamis as obtained from back-calculations. Investigations of high-speed video recordings of laboratory debris flows were combined with measurements of total and pore pressure. The results are pointing towards yet another important role of ambient water: Water that intrudes from the <b>water</b> <b>cushion</b> underneath the hydroplaning head and through cracks in the upper surface of the debris flow may drastically soften initially stiff clayey material in the "neck" of the flow, where significant stretching occurs due to the reduced friction {{at the bottom of the}} hydroplaning head. This self-reinforcing process may lead to the head separating from the main body and becoming an "outrunner" block as clearly observed in several natural debris flows. Comparison of laboratory flows with different material composition indicates a gradual transition from hydroplaning plug flows of stiff clay-rich material, with a very low suspension rate, to the strongly agitated flow of sandy materials that develop a pronounced turbidity current. Statistical analysis of the great number of distinguishable lobes in the Storegga slide complex reveals power-law scaling behavior of the runout distance with the release mass over many orders of magnitude. Mathematical flow models based on viscoplastic material behavior (e. g. BING) successfully reproduce the observed scaling behavior only for relatively small clay-rich debris flows while granular (frictional) models fail at all scales. For very large release masses, hydroplaning or significant softening of the shear layer due to water incorporation must be invoked to recover the observed scaling behavior; a combination of both effects likely will give the most realistic description of the phenomenon. Detailed studies of the neck behavior and the compositional dependence of the material properties are needed to arrive at a quantitative model. Other related and important open questions concern the rheological model appropriate for sandy debris flows and the suspension rate from the dense body into the associated turbidity current...|$|E

40|$|In the current, environmentally-aware, climate {{aircraft}} {{designers are}} under increasing pressure to produce fuel efficient vehicles. Weight reduction {{is an important}} method for increasing fuel efficiency. Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are known to offer weight savings over traditional metallic components, due to their excellent stiffness and strength to weight ratios. However, the major limiting factor {{for the use of}} aerospace quality composites is the manufacturing cost. The costs incurred in the conventional process of prepreg cured in an autoclave are well documented. The research in this thesis is concerned with reducing the cost of manufacturing aircraft standard carbon fibre composite sandwich panels, whilst maintaining mechanical performance. The overall aim of the EngD is to provide a unified approach for assessing the performance of carbon fibre sandwich secondary structure that are manufactured using several different techniques. Cost and performance criteria are defined so that an optimal panel can be produced. The work has been motivated by the industrial sponsor, GE Aviation Systems. Five combinations of raw material and processing techniques, manufacturing options (MOs) were considered in incremental steps from the baseline of unidirectional prepreg cured in an autoclave to the noncrimp fabric (NCF) infiltrated using resin film infusion (RFI) and cured in a conventional oven. For cost and performance analysis a generic panel has been designed that is representative of secondary wing structure on commercial passenger aircraft. The cost was estimated by monitoring the manufacture of generic panels using each MO, whilst the performance was measured by both mechanical characterisation tests and by full scale tests on a custom designed rig. The rig applies a pressure load using a <b>water</b> <b>cushion</b> and allows optical access {{to the surface of the}} panel enabling the use of optical techniques, i. e. thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) and digital image correlation (DIC). Feasibility tests on TSA and DIC demonstrated their use on the materials considered in this thesis, and were used to validate finite element (FE) models. The RFI out-of-autoclave process was found to reduce generic panel manufacture time by almost 30 %, and the material cost was reduced by almost 40 %. The mechanical characterisation tests suggested the ‘new’ process could produce laminates with a similar fibre volume fraction to that of the original process and similar in and out-of-plane mechanical properties. The in-plane stiffness was slightly reduced by 7 %, but the strength showed an increase of 12 %. Full scale tests on the generic panels using point out-of-plane deflection measurements and full field TSA demonstrated the panel produced using the ‘new’ process has adequate performance. Moreover the full-field tests indicated an improvement in performance. Further work is required to optimise the design of the panel for weight, in particular the weight of the raw material, and investigating methods for modelling the NCF for certification...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissipation}} {{of energy}} of flood discharges from water releasing structures of dams is often done by plunging jets diffusing in water and impacting on the riverbed downstream. The construction of expensive concrete structures for energy dissipation can be avoided but {{the assessment of the}} scour evolution is mandatory for dam safety. The scour growth rate and shape depend on the riverbed geology. The geometry of scour may influence the turbulent flow pattern in the pool, the dynamic loadings acting on the rock interface, and the pressures propagating inside rock joints. Up to present, dynamic impact pressures at the pool bottom have been investigated mainly in pools with flat bottom and are therefore described as function of the pool depth and the characteristics of the jets only. To approach the conditions found in practice, non-flat plunge pools and turbulent two-phase jets are investigated in this research work. This fundamental investigation focuses on the interaction between the development of plunging jets in the water and the geometry of the plunge pool. The influence of laterally confining jet diffusion is investigated by means of experimental work in near prototype conditions, in terms of jet velocities and air entrainment in the pool. Different pool geometries typical of prototype conditions are tested and compared with a reference pool with flat bottom. Pressure measurements at the jet outlet, at the pool bottom and inside a closed-end fissure are presented. The main emphasis of the text is on the analysis and the description of physical processes. The integration of the findings in existing scour estimation models is discussed. The thickening of the <b>water</b> <b>cushion</b> downstream, artificially or by scour, is investigated for fully controlled jet issuance conditions. The dissipation of jet energy is estimated based on measurements of mean impact pressures and is compared with results from an analytical model. The developed model features jet diffusion in limited-depth pools and is tentatively applied to turbulent two-phase jets. Agreement is good {{in the early stages of}} scour and in deep flat pools. For pool depths about the jet core development length (i. e. transitional pools), analytical estimates are quite sensitive to the initial assumptions on the centreline velocity decay, dimensions of the impinging zone and pool aeration. The findings highlight the limitations of existing empirical laws in representing the diffusion of turbulent two-phase jets in pools with flat bottom. Turbulent impact pressures are also investigated for increasing pool depths. Based on an evaluation of high-order statistical moments and autocorrelation functions of pressure fluctuations at stagnation, jet development conditions at impact are distinguished in core and developed impact conditions. Core impact conditions are typical of shallow pools and generate negatively asymmetric distributions at stagnation. The end of core development is associated with highly intermittent flow conditions, with important pressure fluctuations (high kurtosis). For developed impact conditions, pressure fluctuations at stagnation are positively asymmetric. A Gaussian distribution fits satisfactorily the data, save for extreme high and low (cumulated) probabilities. Air-water measurements are carried out at selected points in pools with at bottom. They allow describing the behaviour of air bubbles before, at, and aside stagnation. Void fraction estimates close to the entry of rock fissures show that air bubbles reduce in size under the influence of the high-pressure gradient at stagnation. The characteristic dimensions of the air bubbles close to the bottom are small compared to typical entry dimensions of rock fissures. The investigations conducted in pools with flat bottom are used as a reference scenario in the investigation of plunge pools with more realistic geometries. The experimental results show that mean impact pressures at the pool bottom are lower in laterally confined pools than in equivalent pools with flat bottom. The length of core development can be reduced, depending on the degree of confinement and pool depth. Enhanced pool turbulence is described by power spectra density and probabilistic distribution functions of impact pressures. It is concluded that the flow currents created by deflection of the jet on the lateral boundaries of the pool may interfere with the development of the jet, generate additional dissipation in the water column and hinder the propagation in depth of air bubbles in the pool. For shallow and transitional laterally confined pools, pressure fluctuations may have more energy than in corresponding pools with flat bottom. Power spectra of pressure fluctuations have higher energy content in the intermediate frequency range (e. g. 10 a 100 Hz). Extreme positive pressures increase. In terms of scour, there is a trade-off relatively to flat pools: there is hardly core impact and persistent hydro-fracturing (because mean impact pressures are lower), but fracturing may occur if high low-persistence pressure peaks are generated inside rock fissures (by transients due to enhanced impact pressure fluctuations). For deep laterally confined pools, the energy of pressure fluctuations is lower than in pools with flat bottom. Extreme positive pressures are similar, but increase in relative terms to the total energy of pressure fluctuations. Negative extreme pressures are lower. The most relevant flow features in laterally confined pools are identified using direct observations of flow patterns and in-depth analysis of the characteristics of turbulent pressures at impact. Large-scale pool flow features like surface oscillations, shear eddies and air-water ejections are described. The evolution of geometry-induced flow patterns and dynamic loading with scour development, for variable width of confinement and pool depth, are presented for four typical scour scenarios. The role of the deflected upward currents and shear eddies in the dissipation process depends on the degree of confinement, jet velocity and pool depth. The closer they are to the plunging jet, the higher is the {{dissipation of energy}} before impact. Recirculation currents may enhance jet development by either pushing upward currents into the jet. The dynamic pressure measurements performed inside closed-end fissures allow concluding that the dynamic response of rock fissures varies with the turbulent character of impact pressures at the rock interface. It is shown that the dimensions of the entry of the fissure play an important role in filtering turbulent pressure fluctuations in the transition from the pool into the fissure: the larger the dimensions, the lower are the frequencies filtered out. It is observed that the energy of pressure fluctuations inside the fissure is always higher than at the entry, for all pool configurations tested. The energy of pressure fluctuations inside rock fissures is lower in narrow confined pools for transition and deep pools, but higher in shallow pools, compared with equivalent pools with flat bottom. This is also valid for positive extreme pressures. Negative extreme pressures are generally lower. Amplification of pressure peaks is observed inside a closed-end fissure for both shallow and deep pools; it depends of the degree of jet development, i. e. of relative pool depth, pool geometry and jet turbulent characteristics (and, indirectly, of the amount of entrained air reaching the bottom of the pool). Therefore, transient pressure peaks generated inside fissures are a potential agent of scour in laterally confined pools, from shallow to deep. Amplification occurs due to the development of transient flows inside the fissure, that may include column separation. The occurrence of resonance inside fissures is investigated numerically. Multiple resonant harmonics are replicated solving numerically the waterhammer equations inside the fissure with the hydraulic impedance method. A probabilistic-based event analysis is developed to correlate the probability, persistence, duration and energy content of extreme pressure pulses. It is shown that pulses with high extreme (cumulated) probabilities have low persistence and high energy content. The concept of relevant probability is outlined, allowing for the selection of pressure events that should effectively be considered for the propagation of rock fissures or for the dynamic uplift of rock blocks. The role of extreme pressure events in the scouring processes of crack propagation and block displacement is discussed. In conclusion, the experimental investigation of jet diffusion in pools with flat bottom and laterally confined pools shows the importance of pool flow patterns in the definition of impact pressures and transient pressures inside rock fissures. It provides detailed information on hydrodynamic processes involved in rock scour, as well as several contributions to engineering practice, in terms of jet issuance conditions, empirical relationships for impact pressures and recommendations for the design of pre-excavated pools.

Le taux d'affouillement ainsi que la forme de la fosse dépendent de la géologie du lit de la rivière. En l'état actuel, la description des pressions dynamiques n'a été effectuée que pour des fosses à fond plat, en fonction de la profondeur de la fosse et des caractéristiques turbulentes du jet. Afin d'approcher les conditions trouvés en pratique, des fosses d'érosion non-plates ainsi que des jets biphasiques turbulents sont étudiés dans cette recherche. Ce travail porte d'abord sur l'analyse expérimentale du comportement de jets plongeants ayant un champ de vitesses et un processus d'entraînement d'air de conditions quasi-prototype. L'effet d'un confinement latéral de la diffusion du jet dans la fosse d'érosion sur les sollicitations transmises au rocher est mis en évidence. Différentes configurations types de fosses d'érosion sont testées et comparées avec la fosse à fond plat. Les pressions dynamiques sont mesurées à l'intérieur du jet lui-même, au fond de la fosse ainsi qu'à l'intérieur de fissures unifilaires à bout fermé. Ces mesures sont utilisés pour analyser le comportement turbulent de l'écoulement dans la fosse et des régimes transitoires dans les fissures du rocher. Le texte se focalise sur l'analyse et description de processus physiques. L'intégration des résultats dans des modèles existantes pour l'estimation de la profondeur d'affouillement est discutée. L'épaississement du matelas d'eau en aval, artificiellement ou par affouillement, est étudié avec des jets produits en conditions contrôlés. La dissipation de l'énergie de jets dans des fosses d'affouillement est estimée à partir de mesures de pressions moyennes au fond de la fosse, à la zone d'impact. Les résultats expérimentaux sont comparés avec des valeurs obtenues avec un modèle analytique pour la diffusion de jets turbulents biphasiques en bassins à fond plat. Ce dernier fournit des résultats satisfaisants dans le cas de bassins profonds à fond plat ainsi qu'en phase initiale du processus érosif. Pour des profondeurs correspondant à la longueur de développement du jet (situation de transition), le modèle analytique est très sensible aux conditions initiales. Ces dernières portent sur les hypothèses liées à la décroissance de la vitesse à l'axe du jet, aux dimensions de la zone de stagnation et enfin à l'entraînement d'air dans la fosse. Les résultats montrent les limitations des lois empiriques existantes dans la description de la diffusion de jets turbulents biphasiques dans les bassins à fond plat. Les pressions turbulentes à l'impact du jet au fond de fosses à fond plat sont aussi analysés pour plusieurs profondeurs d'eau, à la zone de stagnation. Les conditions d'impact sont caractérisées en fonction de l'évaluation des moments statistique de troisième et quatrième ordre ainsi que des autocorrelations des fluctuations de pression. L'impact en "noyau du jet" est typique de bassins peu profonds et produit des fluctuations de pression d'asymétrie négative. La fin du développement du jet correspond à un caractère intermittent du jet signalé par une augmentation du kurtosis. L'impact d'un "jet développé" produit des fluctuations de pression d'asymétrie positive. Une distribution gaussienne permet un ajustement satisfaisant des pressions dynamiques, à l'exception des valeurs extrêmes de probabilité (cumulé) très haute ou très basse. Des mesures des concentrations en air de l'écoulement sont effectuées en trois points singuliers de fosses à fond plat et de profondeur variable. Les mesures permettent de décrire le comportement des bulles d'air à l'entrée, au milieu et à côté de la zone de stagnation. Les mesures du contenu en air au voisinage de l'entrée des fissures montrent une réduction des dimensions des bulles d'air sous l'effet du fort gradient de pression de stagnation. Les bulles d'air proche du fond sont petites par rapport aux dimensions caractéristiques des fissures du massif rocheux. Les investigations menées sur des fosses à fond plat servent de référence pour l'étude de fosses confinées latéralement (i. e. non plates). Les résultats expérimentaux montrent que pour les dernières, les pressions moyennes à l'impact sont plus faibles que celles mesurées dans les fosses à fond plat. D'autre part, la longueur de développement du noyau du jet peut être réduite, selon le degré de confinement latéral et la profondeur de diffusion. En effet, les courants créés par la déviation du jet plongeant par les parois latérales du confinement peuvent interférer dans le développement du jet; de la dissipation additionnelle sera générée et la pénétration de bulles d'air en profondeur sera rendue plus difficile. Dans les bassins confinés latéralement à faible profondeur ou de transition, les fluctuations de pression peuvent contenir plus d'énergie que dans le cas de bassins plats de profondeur similaire. Les fonctions de densité spectrale révèlent un surplus d'énergie dans la plage de fréquences intermédiaires (e. g. 10 a 100 Hz). L'amplitude des pressions extrêmes positives augmente. Du point de vue de l'affouillement il y des avantages et des inconvénients par rapport aux fosses à fond plat: la gamme de conditions qui produisent l'impact "du noyau" et la rupture de la roche par hydro-fracturing persistent est très limité (car les pressions moyennes à l'impact sont plus faibles), mais la rupture peut être effectuée par des pics de pressions de courte durée générés par des régimes transitoires à l'intérieur de fissures de la roche (dus à l'augmentation du comportement turbulent en surface). Par contre, à plus grande profondeur, l'énergie des fluctuations de pression est plus basse dans les bassins confinés latéralement que dans les bassins à fond plat. Les valeurs extrêmes de pressions positives n'augmentent pas en termes absolus, mais en termes relatifs par rapport à l'énergie totale des fluctuations de pression. Les valeurs extrêmes négatives sont plus basses qu'en bassin à fond plat, indépendamment de la profondeur. Les principales particularités de l'écoulement dans des fosses confinées latéralement, tels que oscillations du plan d'eau, éjections et structures tourbillonnaires sont identifiés sur la base d'observations directes de l'écoulement et des caractéristiques des pressions dynamiques à l'interface eau-rocher. L'évolution de la structure de l'écoulement et des sollicitations dynamiques à l'interface eau-rocher est analysée en fonction de l'évolution de l'affouillement, du degré de confinement latéral et de la profondeur de diffusion, pour quatre scénarios types d'affouillement. Le rôle des courants ascendants et des structures tourbillonnaires sont commentés en regard de leur participation au processus dissipative, selon le degré de confinement, la vitesse du jet et la profondeur de la fosse. Le plus proches elles sont du jet, le plus de dissipation sera produite dans la colonne d'eau avant l'impact. Les courants de re-circulation peuvent aussi contribuer au développement du jet en forçant les courants ascendants vers le jet lui-même. Les mesures de pression effectuées à l'intérieur de fissures montrent que les régimes transitoires de l'écoulement dans les fissures du rocher varient selon les caractéristiques turbulentes des pressions dynamiques à l'impact. L'importance des dimensions de l'entrée de la fissure pour le transfert de pressions est mis en évidence : les plus larges sont les dimensions de la fissure, les plus basses sont les fréquences filtrées. L'énergie des fluctuations de pression mesurées à l'intérieur de la fissure est supérieure à celle mesurée à l'entrée dans chaque cas étudié. Pour les grandes profondeurs ou les profondeurs de transition, les fluctuations de pression dans les fissures sont plus basses dans les bassins latéralement confinés. Pour les faibles profondeurs de diffusion, ces fluctuations sont plus basses dans les bassins à fond plat. L'amplification des pics de pression à l'intérieur des fissures à bout fermé est observée dans le cas de faible profondeurs, ainsi que de grandes profondeurs, dans des bassins confinés latéralement. L'amplification dépend du degré de développement du jet, i. e. de la profondeur de diffusion, de la géométrie de la fosse et des caractéristiques turbulentes du jet (et, indirectement, de la quantité d'air proche du fond). De ce fait, des pics de pression générés par régimes transitoires à l'intérieur de fissures sont un agent potentiel de l'affouillement de fosses latéralement confinées. La rupture de la veine liquide à l'intérieur des fissures est documentée. La mise en résonnance de la fissure est simulée numériquement et comparée avec les mesures de pression. Les oscillations harmoniques sont reproduites par la résolution des équation du coup de bélier à l'intérieur de la fissure par la méthode d'impédance hydraulique. Une méthode d'analyse temporelle des pressions dynamiques est developé. Elle permet de corréler la probabilité d'apparition d'événements de pressions avec leur persistance, durée et contenu énergétique. Son application à plusieurs séries de données expérimentaux montrent que la persistance des événements décroît considérablement pour des événements rares, ayant un contenu énergétique important. Ceci permet la définition d'une probabilité seuil pour la sélection des événements importants pour chaque processus physique. La participation des événements de pression extrêmes aux processus de propagation des fissures et de soulèvement de blocs est analysée. En conclusion, ce travail expérimental démontre l'importance fondamentale de la description de la structure de l'écoulement dans la fosse d'érosion pour l'estimation des sollicitations dynamiques à l'impact et à l'intérieur des fissures du massif rocheux. Elle propose une documentation détaillée de processus hydrodynamiques existants lors de l'affouillement de lits de rivière rocheux par des impacts de jets, ainsi que plusieurs contributions pour la pratique en termes des conditions de sortie du jet, équations empiriques pour les pressions dynamiques à l'impact et recommandations pour le dimensionnement de pré-excavations...|$|E
40|$|Partially filled tanks can {{experience}} sloshing in several practical circumstances. This is a resonance phenomenon where the free-surface can highly deform. The liquid will {{move back and}} forth rising along the side walls, possibly impacting against the roof. Impact on a side tank wall may also occur,e. g. in shallow water conditions. Resulting slamming loads are of main concern. A synergic experimental–numerical investigation of the sloshing flows is currently performed. Here the main focus is on the occurrence of slamming events and on the prediction of the related loads. Numerically, our approach is based on the SPH method, introduced by Monaghan and coauthors (see Monaghan (1994)) and further developed by Colagrossi and Landrini (2003). Both single – and two–phase flow (gas and liquid) SPH models have been developed. This method is able to follow the whole flow evolution in the tank and handle the many relevant and complicated phenomena generally involved. Among those we can list: water run–up and run–down along the side walls, roof impacts, free-surface overturning and breaking onto the underlying <b>water,</b> air <b>cushioning.</b> Often these features characterize the flow for intermediate and shallow water depths which can establish in real tanks and are of interest in the present research activity. Experimentally a two-step investigation has started. We decided to reduce as much as possible the geometric complexities for {{a better understanding of the}} flow features. Therefore we consider the flow in a rigid square tank, as sketched in Figure 1 : Left: sketch of the experimental set up. Wave gauge positions and possible pressure sensor locations are indicated. Dimensions are in millimeters. Right: partial side view of the experimental set-up. The high speed vide...|$|R
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the <b>water</b> but a <b>cushioned</b> area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the {{starting}} position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|R
40|$|In 2001, {{an extreme}} drought {{tightened}} water {{supply in the}} Upper Klamath Basin (basin) while earlier 2001 increases in Endangered Species Act (ESA) water requirements for basin fish species elevated demands. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), which manages irrigation water {{in parts of the}} basin located near the Oregon-California border, responded by severely curtailing water allocations to Reclamation Project (project) irrigators for the 2001 growing season. Consequently, project irrigators lost approximately $ 35 million in farm income, demonstrating that ESA requirements have significantly changed how water must be managed in the basin. These circumstances prompted Reclamation to establish a federally-funded water bank to provide greater supply certainty in the basin. Yet this certainty is undermined by several significant factors which influence the cost effectiveness and geographic impacts of future bank operations. These include unspecified higher ESA water requirements due to a recent ninth circuit court ruling, greatly increased energy rates to irrigators due to a mid- 2006 contract termination with the regional energy provider, uncertain water returns from land idling due to a shortage of data on subirrigation, and unknown annual availabilities of groundwater. Furthermore, although the bank has provided a <b>water</b> supply <b>cushion,</b> greater certainty at a lower cost would result from increased geographic and institutional flexibility in water bank operations. This paper evaluates the potential impacts of the above uncertainties on water bank cost-effectiveness and land idling distribution. Additionally, given the infrastructural and institutional limitations on water transfers in the basin, the cost effectiveness of different levels of water trading flexibility will be compared to assess both realistic and potential banking arrangements. The above objectives are addressed using a mathematical optimization model and a Geographic Information System (GIS) of hydrologic, agronomic and economic data. The model reflects farmer behavior by minimizing farm losses in the context of institutional and physical constraints. Irrigated areas in the basin are spatially arranged in a GIS divided into 15 county-defined units, each with different soil classes, crop rotations, irrigation technologies (impacting energy requirements), and land values. Results are anticipated to provide greater certainty over the spatial and economic impacts of energy price increases and possible changes in ESA requirements. Furthermore, they are anticipated to clarify the significance of subirrigation and groundwater to water management decisions in the basin. The water bank analysis is expected to confirm well documented evidence that increased flexibility induces greater cost effectiveness, but the spatial impacts of these adjustments are uncertain. In the Klamath, cost effectiveness of flexibility may imply that an irrigation infrastructure should be established capable of monitoring and measuring individual transfers...|$|R
50|$|The Galta Gang elite {{are still}} {{homeless}} and Teejay is still missing, but Kamal finds them a potential new home with {{an abundance of}} food and no obvious threats. The grain depot has bags of food that the gang can eat, and the staff don't seem to be bothered by them at all. While Kamal is pleased with himself, Rani is still concerned: she knows that if something seems {{too good to be true}} it probably is. Suddenly a monster-sized langur comes to scare them away. This odd looking predator is a 42-year-old mime artist whose job it is to scare away monkey gangs, and he is very effective. Kamal is the first to bolt, leaving his unprotected gang to escape for themselves, which they do. Now on the streets again, Rani needs Kamal's protection more than ever before, but he is nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, without anyone to rein in his behaviour, Teejay is playing acrobatics on the city's maze of power lines. Eventually, remembering he is all alone, he sees his old home in the distance, the Temple. He hurries there, but instead of finding familiar faces, he finds a new gang there, the large pack of langurs. Surrounded, Teejay initially panics, but the young langurs want to play and groom, and the senior langurs don't mind at all. When Zamir turns up, there is a commotion as the langur pack prepare to defend their home, but Zamir recognises that he is outnumbered and leaves. Seeing Zamir reminds Teejay that he must find his family, so he too takes off. Unfortunately his reckless climbing on wires finally takes its toll as he is electrocuted and falls into a dried out <b>water</b> trough, which <b>cushions</b> his fall but hides him from pilgrims who could help him.|$|R
