Two studies assessed whether people commit the naturalistic fallacy by testing whether genetic explanations for killing and male promiscuity, as compared to experiential explanations (i. e., learning/“nurture ” explanations) increase acceptance of these behaviors. In Study 1, participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> a genetic explanation for why people kill bugs viewed bug killing as more morally acceptable than participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> an experiential explanation, although they did not reliably kill more bugs.

She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean <b>who</b> <b>reads</b> his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the role of}} affective priming during the {{processing}} of news articles. It is assumed that the valence of the affective response to a news article will influence the processing of subsequent news articles. More specifically, it is hypothesized that participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> a positive article will recall subsequent positive information better than negative information. Similarly, participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> a negative article will recall subsequent negative information better. To test this assumption, an experimental study was conducted (N = 87). Findings show that participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> an initial positive article recalled more positive than negative information from six subsequent news articles. Participants <b>who</b> <b>read</b> an initial negative article recalled more negative information than positive information from subsequent news messages.
