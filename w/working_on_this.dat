5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{commissioned}} {{to repair a}} chimney at a local brewery. While <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> he met a local welder who also knew the vicar of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who wanted some repairs made to Bolton parish church's weathervanes. The vicar drove a 1929Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah's AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the vicar asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the vicar enabled him to gain more work from the local clergy.|$|E
5|$|John {{returns to}} the Resistance {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. <b>Working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> intelligence, the human militia plans to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). <b>Working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E
5|$|After A Song to David, {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart {{to find a new}} publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E

25|$|The Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc is a Baroque {{monument}} (Trinity column) in the Czech Republic {{built from}} 1716 to 1754. The main {{purpose was to}} celebrate the Catholic Church and faith, partly caused by feeling of gratitude for ending a plague, which struck Moravia (now in the Czech Republic) between 1713 and 1715. The column was also understood to be an expression of local patriotism, since all artists and master craftsmen <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> monument were Olomouc citizens, and almost all depicted saints were connected {{with the city of}} Olomouc in some way.|$|E
25|$|He {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} write a book on computer programming language compilers. While <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.|$|E
25|$|In 1666, {{a project}} for the main altar by Malta's {{greatest}} sculptor, Melchiorre Cafà, was approved and begun. Cafà intended a large sculpture group in bronze depicting the Baptism of Christ. Following Cafà's tragical death in 1667 in a foundry accident while <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> work in Rome, the plans were abandoned. Only in 1703, Giuseppe Mazzuoli, Cafà's only pupil, finished a marble group of the Baptism of Christ {{which might have been}} influenced by his master's undocumented designs but certainly is strongly dependent on a small baptism group by Alessandro Algardi.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the success}} of the movie of Fight Club, {{interest}} began to build about adapting Survivor to film. The film rights to Survivor were sold in early 2001, but no movie studio had committed to filming the novel. After the attacks on The Pentagon and World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, movie studios apparently deemed the novel too controversial to film because it includes the hijacking and crashing of a civilian airplane. In mid-2004, however, 20th Century Fox committed to adapting Palahniuk's novel. Palahniuk has said that the same people who made the film Constantine will be <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> film.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} jazz in Cuba was hidden {{for many years}} by the unwillingness of record {{companies}} to make recordings available. However, in recent years, {{it has become clear}} that its history in Cuba is as long as its history in the USA. The key figure in revealing the early days of Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta, musician and musicologist, who has been <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> topic for many years. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz from the U.S. perspective. The pre-history of Cuban jazz includes musicians like Louis Moreau Gottschalk and W.C. Handy, who visited Cuba and brought creole ideas into their music.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{adaptation}} {{extends to}} humans, as well. Studies {{have found that}} {{a small number of}} native Tibetan women have a genotype which codes for hemoglobin to be more highly saturated with oxygen. Natural selection seems to be the main force <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> gene because the mortality rate of offspring is significantly lower for women with higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity when compared to the mortality rate of offspring from women with low hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. While the exact genotype and mechanism by which this occurs is not yet clear, selection is acting on these women's ability to bind oxygen in low partial pressures, which overall allows them to better sustain crucial metabolic processes.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Army {{had been}} very {{impressed}} {{with the performance of}} the 25cm experimental sets and became interested in using it as a range finder in a Gun Laying radar. Operators would point the radar at targets indicated to them by search radars, and from then on the radar information would be fed to the analogue computers that aimed the guns. Power was not a serious concern in this case as the range would be relatively short. The Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) of the Army was <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> using the klystron design from Birmingham and British Thomson-Houston (BTH) as their industrial partner.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} before his death, DeLorean planned to resurrect his car company, and gave {{interviews}} describing a new vehicle called the DMC2. According to his family, {{he spent much of}} his last several years <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> new venture. In an effort to gather funds, he designed and sold high-end watches via the internet under the name DeLorean Time. Made of what appeared in promotions to be injection molded stainless steel, the watches sold for $3,495. Purchasers were placed on a waiting list for the chance to buy one of the first DMC2s when they became available. None of the watches seem to have ever been built or delivered to customers before DeLorean's death.|$|E
