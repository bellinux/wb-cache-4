5|$|All {{his adult}} life, Pflueger {{maintained}} his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown {{late into the}} evening, {{he was known to}} spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady lady friend on his arm. Pflueger never married and left no children. His brother Milton, fifteen years younger, had been working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> since the 1930s and, at Tim's death, Milton reorganized and headed the company, doing business as Milton T.

After studying in the city for a few years <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Messrs. Ilbury & Magniac, Magniac sent Bovet to Canton, China in 1818. Almost as soon as he arrived he was able to sell four of his watches for the equivalent of US$1million in 2008 currency.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, Moore {{signed a}} record deal <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Firm,</b> a record label run by EMI. The singer's fifth studio album, Wild Hope, was {{released}} in June 2007. A departure from her previous style, Moore incorporated folk and acoustic music into the album. The album peaked at number thirty on the Billboard 200 chart {{and went on to}} sell about 109,000 copies in the US. In May 2009, Moore's sixth studio album, Amanda Leigh, was released through Storefront Recordings. Following the same musical style as Wild Hope, the album's title was taken from Moore's full name. It debuted at number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 and has sold 16,000 copies in the US, as of June 2009. The singles from Wild Hope and Amanda Leigh were commercially unsuccessful and failed to chart.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{received}} his elementary {{education at the}} Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy. After his father died in 1853, he again left school so as to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William {{was hired as a}} teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west. He stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job. Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers. Millard Fillmore, the 13th President of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership. Cleveland later took a clerkship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> began to read the law, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Sharpe {{started his}} {{practice}} {{at the end of}} 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in StLeonard's Gate large enough to accommodate himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, John Douglas joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> until about 1859, when he moved to Chester to establish his own practice. Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} from the Table  3 that, in total about 488 total {{entities}} 266 (about 55  %) are <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>firms</b> and <b>the</b> rest are Indian institutions/firms. <b>The</b> <b>firms</b> mostly collaborate <b>with</b> other foreign firms. This is perhaps due to <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> global alliance extended to the Indian subsidiaries. <b>The</b> linkages <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>firms</b> are <b>the</b> second most prominent forms of linkages. There are many domestic firms which have formed alliances <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>firms</b> R&D units. Indian universities and government research institutes are not much prominent in the formation of linkages <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>firms.</b> It shows that industry academia linkages are quite weak in India.|$|R

5|$|Much of Van Rensselaer's {{early life}} is unknown to today's historians, though in March 1608 {{it has been}} {{recorded}} that he {{was taking care of}} some business of Van Bijler in Prague. It seems Van Bijler gradually retired from his business, leaving it in the control of Van Rensselaer. During his tenure at the helm of his uncle's business, Van Rensselaer proposed a merger <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Jan van Wely, son of one of Van Bijler's sisters, who had an equally successful jewelry business. The firms combined under the name of Jan van Wely & Co. in February 1614. Van Rensselaer's name {{was not included in the}} name of the new company, since he contributed only one eighth of the investment capital, whereas van Wely contributed half (192,000 guilders). In 1616, van Wely was called on by Prince Maurice to meet at the Hague for a sale in jewels. He was murdered while waiting to meet with the Prince. The firm's contract stipulated that at the death of Jan van Wely, the remaining members of the firm should continue the partnership for another six years. Van Wely's murder, therefore, caused no change in the business, but it seems that at the expiration of that time, Van Rensselaer began again on his own account, founding Kiliaen van Rensselaer & Co. with partner Jacques I'Hermite.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E

5000|$|Assets under {{management}} (AUM) {{is very popular}} within the financial industry {{as a measure of}} size and success of an investment management firm, compared with its history of assets {{under management}} in previous periods, and compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> competitors. Methods of calculating AUM vary between firms. Investment management companies generally charge their clients fees as a proportion of assets under management, so assets under management, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> average fee rate, are the key factors indicating an investment management company's top line revenue. The fee structure depends on the contract between each client and <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> or fund.|$|R
