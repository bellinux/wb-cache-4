25|$|No. 56 was rebuilt by Jones in 1895, and {{the other}} two were {{similarly}} rebuilt by Drummond in 1897. Alterations included thicker tyres to increase the <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> to , and the provision of larger bunkers. No. 16 was later renumbered 49. All three passed to the LMS in 1923; who removed the names when applying LMS livery.|$|E
25|$|Small-wheeled (<b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> {{less than}} 14cm, or about 5.5inches) {{instruments}} are traditionally found in Central and Eastern Europe. They feature a broad keybox and the drone strings run within the keybox. Because {{of the small}} size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} William Adam's 0-4-4 designs, the O2 Class was a {{development}} {{of his previous}} T1 class of 1888. The brief behind the design {{was to create a}} locomotive capable of mixed-traffic operations, a characteristic dictated by the relatively small <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> and smaller cylinders, effectively to replace the obsolete Beattie Well Tank. As a result, a compact locomotive with high route availability was produced, a factor that would be essential during the later career of the class.|$|E
50|$|The later {{locomotives}} {{were classified}} as 20A class; the main difference being that the 20ths' inside and outside trailing wheels were of the same size, on the 20A, the inside trailing <b>wheels</b> <b>diameter</b> had been increased in size. The 20As were also heavier.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with bar frames, Walschaerts valve gear, steam-operated {{reversing gear}} and 11 in diameter piston valves. Since {{the proportions of}} the engine units and the <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> {{were the same as}} that of the Class 19D, many of their parts were made interchangeable.|$|R

25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter,</b> that will fit right into the wheel wells. For the US vehicles, the wheel wells capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the wheel well index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E
25|$|The RS6 {{was used}} in the North American SPEED World Challenge GT Series of auto racing for three years - 2002 to 2004, {{claiming}} the manufacturers' championship victory successively in all three years. Once again, the special race derivative of the twin-turbo V8 engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). However, the 2005 season proved difficult due to performance restrictions imposed on Champion Audi Racing by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), with Champion deciding to run a different <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter,</b> and the trade-off was reducing boost pressure.|$|E
25|$|The high-wheeler {{lives on}} in the gear inch units used by cyclists in English-speaking {{countries}} to describe gear ratios. These are calculated by multiplying the <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> in inches {{by the number of}} teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket. The result is the equivalent diameter of a penny-farthing wheel. A 60-inch gear, the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler, is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle, while top gears on many exceed 100inches. There was at least one 64-inch Columbia made in the mid-1880s, but 60 was the largest in regular production.|$|E
5000|$|Low floor wagons for {{the rolling}} road (Class Saad…) are {{suitable}} for loading entire articulated lorries including their tractor units. The necessary low floors required are achieved by using especially small <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> {{in each of the}} four-axle bogies. These make the wagons relatively expensive to build and maintain.|$|R
5000|$|Custom {{wheels are}} {{increasing}} in popularity year after year. Nearly {{one-third of all}} new-vehicle buyers customize their vehicles with custom wheels. Custom wheel spinners for custom wheels then came about in the late 1990s and got extremely popular in the new millennium. The popularity has even grown further {{by the introduction of}} larger <b>wheel</b> and spinner <b>diameters</b> such as 18" [...] / 20" [...] / 22" [...] / 24" [...] / 26" [...] and even up to 30" [...] inch <b>wheels</b> <b>diameters.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick {{patented}} a 4WD system, GB 1113068, {{that used}} hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design {{that did not}} use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> ratios.|$|E
25|$|The Armstrong gun—mainly the 12 pounder—was used {{extensively}} in the 1863 conflict in New Zealand between British troops and Maori in the Waikato. A well preserved 12-pounder which {{was used in the}} battle of Rangiriri is at the Te Awamutu museum. The barrel can traverse 6 degrees left or right without moving the gun carriage. The wheels are wooden with a 75mm wide steel band. The <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> is 1.7 m. The track width is 1.8 m. Barrel width at the muzzle is 140mm. Such was the confidence of the army in the accuracy of the gun that at the battle of Hairini Ridge the artillery was fired {{over the heads of the}} advancing infantry as they stormed the ridge. The infantry took cover in a slight depression in the ground in front of the Maori trenches and then stormed the trenches when the shelling stopped.|$|E

50|$|Common to the {{different}} delivery batches were driving <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> of 1,130 mm and axle bases of 2,200 mm. The length of the locomotive and {{the height of the}} centre of the boiler above the rails were also identical on all models. The locomotives of the last two batches had a steam dome, whilst the older ones just had a Regleraufsatz.|$|R
40|$|Multilevered {{suspension}} system gives body of vehicle high clearance and allows wheels to be steered independently. Suspension linkages above wheels enable body to skim over obstacles {{as high as}} wheel. Levers and independently steered wheels enable vehicle to climb steps 1 1 / 2 <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> high and cross gaps 1 3 / 4 wide. Adaptable to off-the-road recreational vehicles, military scout vehicles, and robotic emergency vehicles...|$|R
500|$|There are two bogies per car, {{each with}} two axles. The <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> is [...] for new wheels, and [...] when fully worn-down. The center {{distance}} between the bogies is [...] The primary suspension is steel coil spring between the axles and the bogies, with a secondary air suspension between the frame and the bogies. The latter, which the MX3000 {{was the first to}} use on the metro, gives reduced noise, better comfort and makes it possible to adjust the height with changed passenger weight.|$|E

The El 18 has a Knorr HSM mechanical braking system, but unlike the Swiss versions {{does not have a}} rail brake. The design of the locomotive was by the Italian company Pininfarina. The machine room is designed with a center aisle, the driver's cabs have pressurization applied to avoid air pressure dropping when running through tunnels, and the cabs are equipped with air conditioning.|$|E

Each locomotive weighs , of which [...] is electrical equipment. Each locomotive has [...] of dead weight to increase the locomotive's weight to the maximum axle weight, and further weight increase has been achieved by making the walls [...] wide with armored steel. The extra wall thickness also provides for increased structural strength, to withstand collisions with snowdrifts and elk. The sides of the walls were built as flat as possible to reduce the sticking of blowing snow and ice formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{grinding}} machine {{consists of a}} bed with a fixture to guide and hold the work piece, and a power-driven grinding wheel spinning at the required speed. The speed {{is determined by the}} <b>wheel’s</b> <b>diameter</b> and manufacturer’s rating. The grinding head can travel across a fixed work piece, or the work piece can be moved while the grind head stays in a fixed position.|$|R
25|$|Large-wheeled {{instruments}} (<b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> between 14 and 17cm, {{or about}} 5.56.6inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox. They also generally have more strings and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments {{have as many}} as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.|$|R
50|$|Like the Class 19, the Class 19A {{also had}} Walschaerts valve gear and a bar frame. Col F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) at the time, {{redesigned}} the Class 19 {{to achieve a}} lighter axle loading by reducing the coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> from 54 to 51 in, reducing the cylinder diameter from 21 to 19+1/2 in and by using a slightly smaller boiler.|$|R
500|$|The El 17 is an {{electric}} locomotive designed for intercity trains, {{but is also}} capable of hauling light freight trains. The body is welded as a self-containing construction. The roof (light alloy) sections can be removed, and the locomotives were the first Norwegian locomotives to have a center aisle in the machine room. The locomotives are [...] long, have a <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> of [...] and weigh [...] The locomotives can run in multiple; by using a UIC 568 signalling cable, the locomotives {{do not need to}} be adjacent to each other in the train. the El 17 has the unique pointed front that was first used on the El 16, and is also found on the Di 4 and Di 6 classes.|$|E
500|$|The steel {{bodies are}} [...] long. The longer length {{is for the}} three b-series units and the two a-series {{locomotives}} that {{were made in the}} batch, originally intended for VR. The a-series has a Co'Co' wheel arrangement, while the b-series has a (A1A)'(A1A)' arrangement, where the center of the three axles on each bogie is unpowered. The wheels have a [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter</b> and the locomotives have a weight of [...] for the a-series and [...] for the b-series. The trains can be run in multiple with the Di 4, Di 6 and Di 8. All the Di 3 engines featured a bulldog nose, the only locomotive type in Norway to do so. The locomotives were at first delivered in a dark green livery, but during the 1960s this was changed to red, and the last delivered units never had a green scheme.|$|E
500|$|Concern about {{smoke and}} steam in the tunnels led to new designs of steam locomotive. Before the line opened, in 1861 trials {{were made with}} the {{experimental}} [...] "hot brick" [...] locomotive nicknamed Fowler's Ghost. This was unsuccessful and the first public trains were hauled by broad-gauge GWR Metropolitan Class condensing 2-4-0 tank locomotives designed by Daniel Gooch. They were followed by standard-gauge GNR locomotives until the Met received its own 4-4-0 tank locomotives, built by Beyer Peacock of Manchester. Their design is frequently attributed to the Met's Engineer John Fowler, but the locomotive was a development of one Beyer had built for the Spanish Tudela to Bilbao Railway, Fowler specifying only the driving <b>wheel</b> <b>diameter,</b> axle weight {{and the ability to}} navigate sharp curves. Eighteen were ordered in 1864, initially carrying names, and by 1870 40 had been built. To reduce smoke underground, at first coke was burnt, changed in 1869 to smokeless Welsh coal.|$|E
50|$|Widths {{of tires}} and {{corresponding}} ISO width designations may vary, though the <b>wheel</b> outside <b>diameter</b> remains approximately the same.|$|R
50|$|The Class 14 had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and a Belpaire firebox and was superheated. It was {{delivered}} with Type MP1 tenders, {{which had a}} coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. Apart from the differences in their coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters,</b> the Class 14 was a better locomotive with a more modern cylinder design, having straighter ports and a larger steam chest volume {{than the other two}} classes.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle tire changers {{are less}} {{sophisticated}} than passenger cars and light truck or heavy-duty tire changers because {{they deal with}} smaller and lighter tires and wheels. Motorcycle tire changers mainly provide a simple bead loosening system and rim clamps powered manually. Certain motorcycle tire changers can accommodate <b>wheel</b> <b>diameters</b> as small as 10" [...] and wheels at least 1-1/2" [...] wide. [...] In addition, small atv wheels and tires are used on motorcycle tire changers.|$|R
