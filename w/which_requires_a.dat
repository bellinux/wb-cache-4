5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E

At the end of line eight Shakespeare uses a period to bring the sonnet to a stop, changing the sonnet's direction by moving away from rhetorical questions to a more decisive tone within the sestet, which seems to answer the distress of the octave.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required {{to contribute to the}} delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton {{to the north of the}} Humber estuary.|$|E

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} shows a fictive Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some {{buildings and}} landmarks {{can be identified}} with Jerusalem. It closely resembles {{the background of the}} Rolin panel, which has undergone much deeper attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the Mosque of Omar, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of white flowers in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the Ghent Altarpieces central panel; behind Francis are dwarf palms.|$|E

5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed {{in more recent}} years. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by helicopter—as opposed to the M198, <b>which</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> C-5 or C-17 to airlift. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to —a longer range {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give Zumwalt-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M-198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are far less expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.|$|E
