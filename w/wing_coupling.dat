The sensor consists of two identical <b>wings</b> <b>coupled</b> in the middle and the entire structure is connected to a substrate using two legs in the middle. In response to sound, the <b>coupled</b> <b>wings</b> oscillate with rocking and bending like motions at frequencies that depend on the mechanical characteristics of the structure.

The devices were fabricated by the MEMSCAP foundry service using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate with a 25 ?m device layer. Using a laser vibrometer, response to incident sound pressure was measured at different frequencies and angles.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] narrowband MEMS direction finding sensor has been developed based on the mechanically coupled ears of the Ormia Ochracea fly. The sensor consists of two <b>wings</b> <b>coupled</b> at the middle and attached to a substrate using two legs. The sensor operates at its bending resonance frequency and has cosine directional characteristics {{similar to that of}} a pressure gradient microphone. Thus, the directional response of the sensor is symmetric about the normal axis making the determination of the direction ambiguous. To overcome this shortcoming two sensors were assembled with a canted angle similar to that employed in radar bearing locators. The outputs of two sensors were processed together allowing direction finding with no requirement of knowing the incident sound pressure level. At the bending resonant frequency of the sensors (1. 69 kHz) an output voltage of about 25 V/Pa was measured. The angle uncertainty of the bearing of sound ranged from less than 0. 3 ° close to the normal axis (0 °) to 3. 4 ° at the limits of coverage (± 60 °) based on the 30 ° canted angle used. These findings indicate the great potential to use dual MEMS direction finding sensor assemblies to locate sound sources with high accuracy. TDSION...|$|R

5000|$|A cursorial, or [...] "running" [...] {{model was}} {{originally}} proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston in 1879. This theory states that [...] "flight evolved in running bipeds {{through a series}} of short jumps". As the length of the jumps extended, the wings were used not only for thrust but also for stability, and eventually eliminated the gliding intermediate. This theory was modified in the 1970s by John Ostrom to describe the use of wings as an insect-foraging mechanism which then evolved into a wing stroke. Research was conducted by comparing the amount of energy expended by each hunting method with the amount of food gathered. The potential hunting volume doubles by running and jumping. To gather the same volume of food, Archaeopteryx would expend less energy by running and jumping than by running alone. Therefore, the cost/benefit ratio would be more favorable for this model. Due to Archaeopteryx's long and erect leg, supporters of this model say the species was a terrestrial bird. This characteristic allows for more strength and stability in the hindlimbs. Thrust produced by the <b>wings</b> <b>coupled</b> with propulsion in the legs generates the minimum velocity required to achieve flight. This wing motion is thought to have evolved from asymmetrical propulsion flapping motion. [...] Thus, through these mechanisms, Archaeopteryx was able to achieve flight from the ground up.|$|R
