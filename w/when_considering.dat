5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed.

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck.

5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed more rapidly and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period.

During the August 18 Qualifying rounds, King was placed in Heat 2 versus competitors that included Russia's Tatiana Lebedeva and Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare, both of whom received medals in the event finals. King jumped a distance of 6.01meters, 0.69meters behind leading qualifier Lebedeva's score, placing nineteenth (out of twenty-one) in the event. She placed last in the heat, ahead of two disqualified athletes, and thirty-sixth (out of forty-two) athletes <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> all heats at once. Arantxa King did not progress to the next and final round on August 22.|$|E
5|$|The Avars had mounted archers with {{composite}} bows {{that could}} double as heavy cavalry with lances. They were skilled in siegecraft and could construct trebuchets and siege towers. In their siege of Constantinople, they constructed walls of circumvallation to prevent easy counterattack and used mantelets or wooden frames covered with animal hides {{to protect against}} defending archers. Furthermore, like many nomads, they gathered other warriors such as Gepids and Slavs to assist them. However, since Avars depended on raiding the countryside for supplies, {{it was difficult for}} them to maintain long sieges, especially <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> their less mobile gathered allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} is further complicated <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> fusion in vivo since biological fusion {{is almost always}} regulated {{by the action of}} membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.|$|E
5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. <b>When</b> <b>considering</b> the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very similar {{to one of the}} other types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E

5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII {{to the point where he}} wondered whether he would actually be Zack. However, <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>considering</b> his {{appearance}} for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after {{his appearance}} in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, {{with the addition of a}} green vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare.|$|E
5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but <b>when</b> <b>considering</b> Hancock's findings in September 1963 it {{wanted to be able to}} offer a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E
