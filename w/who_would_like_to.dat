5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E

Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Netball England national team member Tamsin Greenway, two time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes and Olympic heptathlon competitor Denise Lewis are English supporters <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see netball in future Olympic games. The earliest the sport could be included on the programme would be 2024.|$|E

When Countdown was commissioned for Channel 4, the number of hostesses expanded further: Cathy Hytner and Beverley Isherwood selected the letters and numbers tiles respectively, and calculations in the numbers rounds were checked by Linda Barrett or Carol Vorderman. Vorderman, a Cambridge graduate and member of Mensa, was appointed {{as one of the}} numbers experts after responding to an advertisement in a national newspaper which asked for a young woman <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become a game show hostess.

500|$|The {{film was}} first shown at Loew's State Theater in New York City on July 2, 1958.

(the) Incidents and characters of the original novel are distorted, but the plot stands up well and the dialog is salty and emotion-packed.

Dr. Neveeve is executed for her participation and Solovet, the project's head, is imprisoned in preparation for a trial.

Though she is healing, Gregor's mother is too weak to go home, and so the book ends with Gregor confiding his problems to his neighbor Mrs. Cormaci.|$|E
500|$|Pool of Radiance was {{the first}} in a four-part series of {{computer}} D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure for those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> take a side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that [...] "you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game." ...|$|E
