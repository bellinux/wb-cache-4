500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Provo of GameSpot {{reviewed}} the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007, citing the excellent graphics, sound, and general {{intensity of the}} game. He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design. However, once accustomed, he said, [...] "you start totally feeling <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be an army of one trading firepower {{with some of the}} universe's largest, most elaborate creatures. That's a great feeling." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it. [...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] said Thomas. [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was a truly dismal {{contrast}} to the fatness of the land they had been passing through, and the parson's voice issuing from bloodless lips, although complacent, was pathetic. It was peculiar, that voice of his, seeming to indicate an intimate acquaintanceship with what was fat and fine, to convey contempt for the vulgar need of money, while all the time his eyes--those watery, ascetic eyes--as plain as speech they said, [...] "Oh, to know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to have a pound or two to spare just once a year, or so!" ...|$|E

To know and ordain and superintend exactly what silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on what occasions, to have cellar and pantry and plate-cupboard under a minutely devised and undeviating administration, to be noiseless, impalpable, omnipresent, and, as far as your own department is concerned, omniscient?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 141. I was {{at first}} a little despondent about this; but, on the whole, I believe {{it will have a}} good effect upon our {{literature}} for some time to come; and then, perhaps, the public may recover its patience again. For certainly it is excellent discipline for an author to feel that he must say all he has to say in the fewest possible words, or his reader is sure to skip them; and in the plainest possible words, or his reader will certainly misunderstand them. Generally, also, a downright fact may be told in a plain way; and we want downright facts at present more than anything else. And though I often hear moral people complaining of the bad effects of want of thought, for my part, {{it seems to me that}} one of the worst diseases to which the human creature is liable is its disease of thinking. If it would only just look[19] at a thing instead of thinking <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> or do a thing instead of thinking it cannot be done, we should all get on far better.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} {{considered}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to {{be a man}} who doesn't exist? I mean {{to be a man}} with a fictitious character that he has to keep up at the expense not merely of personal talents: To be a new kind of hypocrite hiding a talent in a new kind of napkin. This man has chosen his hypocrisy very ingeniously; it was really a new one. A subtle villain has dressed up as a dashing gentleman and a worthy business man and a philanthropist and a saint; but the loud checks of a comical little cad were really rather a new disguise. But the disguise must be very irksome to a man who can really do things. This is a dexterous little cosmopolitan guttersnipe who can do scores of things, not only shoot, but draw and paint, and probably play the fiddle. Now a man like that may find the hiding of his talents useful; but he could never help wanting to use them where they were useless. If he can draw, he will draw absent-mindedly on blotting paper. I suspect this rascal has often drawn poor old Puggy's face on blotting paper. Probably he began doing it in blots as he afterward did it in dots, or rather shots. It was the same sort of thing; he found a disused target in a deserted yard and couldn't resist indulging in a little secret shooting, like secret drinking. You thought the shots all scattered and irregular, and so they were; but not accidental. No two distances were alike; but the different points were exactly where he wanted to put them. There's nothing needs such mathematical precision as a wild caricature. I've dabbled a little in drawing myself, and I assure you that to put one dot where you want it is a marvel with a pen close to a piece of paper. It was a miracle to do it across a garden with a gun. But a man who can work those miracles will always itch to work them, if it's only in the dark." ...|$|E

5000|$|The weather {{deteriorated}} steadily, and towering waves buffeted our tiny, war-weary, blacked-out vessels. The spray drove {{against our}} skin like stinging pellets of birdshot. We {{would fall into}} a trough, then climb up the steep water peak, only to slide down the other side. The boat would toss crazily back and forth, seeming to hang free in space as though about to breach, and would then break away and go forward with a rush.

5000|$|Kohan gave Spektor {{access to}} rough edits of the episodes {{while the first}} season was in production.

[...] After recording the song with producer Rob Cavallo, she brought the demo to Kohan, initially apprehensive that Kohan would not like it. [...] "We took out the rough mix and listened to it with headphones and sort of held our breath, like, 'Is she going to like it?' And then she said, 'This is fucking awesome, I love it! It’s going to fit really well!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by a war veteran Worley met who was having a difficult time adjusting to life back home after being in a war zone for many months. Worley says, [...] "It made me think about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for all the soldiers, who have served in conflicts past and present, to adjust to being back home. The strain of war must be incredible." [...] He adds, [...] "This song is from the soldier's perspective and the message is, 'Hey man, cut me a little slack if I need a little time to re-adjust here. I'll get there but be a little patient with me - I just came back from a war." ...|$|E

They give very short, blunt answers to the narrator's {{suggestion}} that they all might freeze to death if the horses give out: “To be sure, we may.” After driving a while longer, the men in the sledge begin arguing about whether what they see on the horizon is an encampment. The narrator becomes sleepy and thinks that he is freezing to death. He has hallucinations about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to freeze to death, dozing and waking alternately.|$|E
5000|$|In {{collaboration}} with Zimbabwean John Mapondera, in 1974 Grant {{set up the}} Drum Arts Centre in London (not {{to be confused with}} The Drum in Birmingham) to provide a springboard and provide a national centre for black artistic talent. Lawrence Olivier rebuffed Grant's invitation to become a patron of Drum, accusing him of being separatist. As recalled by Gus John, a Drum trustee (other trustees included Tania Rose, Chris Konyils, Helen McEachrane, Gurmukh Singh, Eric Smellie and Margaret Busby), Grant said at the time: [...] "These people are simply incapable of seeing the world through our lenses, incapable of imagining for just one moment <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for us to experience their system which to us is anything but as open as they would have us believe. They therefore see our self-organisation as an affront." ...|$|E
5000|$|Variety {{agreed with}} several {{previous}} reviewers, praising Imbruglia's performance—"Believably expressing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> {{to live with}} ungovernable sorrow, the actress proves to have {{much more than just}} a face the camera adores"—as well as that of other cast members: [...] "Younger cast members also impress." [...] The reviewer, however, craved greater dialogue and did not feel that Elise (Imbruglia) and co-worker Martin (Frederiksen) were a believable couple. The reviewer concluded with exemplary comments on the technical aspects of the film, describing it as [...] "first class", and going on to say, [...] "Kim Batterham's striking widescreen imagery casts a warm glow over the youthful summer flashbacks, with tighter, cooler framing for Elise's troubled present. Rita Zanchetta's outstanding production design features Dorothy's house as a time-frozen mausoleum of anguish that creaks and groans with what seems to be its own shallow breath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} the heavy play goes on," [...] Boldero said. [...] "None of your four or five guineas wagers there, fifties and {{hundreds}} are nearer the mark, and I have seen a thousand wagered many a time.

She was promoted to Chief News Correspondent in 1989 and held the role for fourteen years. One of her first assignments was to report the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
