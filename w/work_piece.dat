5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|Multidirectional Forging {{is forming}} of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> {{in a single}} step in several directions. The multidirectional forming takes place through {{constructive}} measures of the tool. The vertical movement of the press ram is redirected using wedges which distributes and redirects {{the force of the}} forging press in horizontal directions.|$|E

50|$|After {{programming}} the <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> {{and entering}} length of bars the control automatically calculates {{the maximum number}} of pieces to be punched (for example 18 pieces of a bar of 6000 mm). Once the desired number of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> is entered, the bar is pushed toward the stop. The machine is fully automated once the production process is launched.|$|R

25|$|Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is {{also used}} as a coolant. In this {{application}} pressurized liquid CO2 is allowed to expand and this {{is accompanied by a}} drop in temperature, enough to cause a change of phase into a solid. These solid crystals are redirected into the cut zone by either external nozzles or through-the-spindle delivery, to provide temperature controlled cooling of the cutting tool and <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of press forging, {{as compared to}} drop-hammer forging, {{is its ability to}} deform the complete workpiece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> in contact with the hammer and anvil; the interior of the workpiece will stay relatively undeformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part's strain rate. By controlling the compression rate of the press forging operation, the internal strain can be controlled.|$|E
25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working against the grain is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{production}} system {{consisting of a}} work station, a loading and unloading stations linked by a closed-loop material-handling system is considered. The material-handling system consists of two continuous line conveyors. Each conveyor is assumed to have a specified constant velocity, length and capacity. The work station is assumed to have a single machine, an unloading station and no local storage. In this {{production system}} the <b>work</b> <b>pieces,</b> which at their instant of arrival find the work station busy, are blocked. Those <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> bypass the <b>work</b> station and are transported by the conveyor to the loading station to merge with the incoming <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> to be transported to the work station again. The above production system is modeled by a G/G/ 1 / 0 queueing loss system with retrials, stationary counting arrival process, generally distributed service times, a single server and no waiting room. The flow of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> inside the system is modeled by a point process and is approximated by a renewal process. To analyze the asymptotic performance of the above system, a recursive procedure is developed. Furthermore, an expression for the asymptotic distribution {{of the number of}} <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> along each conveyor is derived and is used to control the congestion along the material handling system. Finally numerical results are provided and compared against those from a simulation study...|$|R
50|$|The {{show has}} a tight filming schedule. The show {{does not have}} a real script; instead, Underhill works out the story he is going to present and how to do it. He decides where camera shots are needed and sets <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> and tools in those locations. The filming of {{different}} shots is limited to three takes because of the limit of <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> used on the show.|$|R
25|$|When done in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.|$|E
25|$|Liquids tend to {{have better}} thermal {{conductivity}} than gases, {{and the ability to}} flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid during evaporation. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from overheating. The coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or liquid metals, such as sodium or bismuth. Liquid propellant films are used to cool the thrust chambers of rockets. In machining, water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> and the tooling. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.|$|E

5000|$|Ultrasonic {{vibration}} machining physically operates by {{the mechanism}} of microchipping or erosion on the <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface. Since the abrasive slurry is kept in motion by high frequency, low amplitude vibrations the impact forces of the slurry are significant causing high contact stresses. These high contact stresses are achieved by the small contact area between the slurry's particles and the <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface. Brittle materials fail by cracking mechanics and these high stresses are sufficient to cause micro-scale chips {{to be removed from}} its surface. The material as a whole does not fail due to the extremely localized stress regions. The average force imparted by a particle of the slurry impacting the <b>work</b> <b>piece's</b> surface and rebounding can be characterized by the following equation: ...|$|R

2500|$|Soldering is a joining {{process that}} occurs at {{temperatures}} below [...] It {{is similar to}} brazing {{in the way that}} a filler is melted and drawn into a capillary to form a join, although at a lower temperature. Because of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the metallurgical reaction between filler and <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is minimal, resulting in a weaker joint.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> stops rotating and the driven tool executes the machining operation with a rotating cutting tool. [...] The CNC machines use x, y, and z coordinates {{in order to control}} the turning tools and produce the product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in 3D.|$|E
2500|$|Brazing is a joining {{process in}} which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a {{capillary}} formed by the assembly {{of two or more}} work pieces. [...] The filler metal reacts metallurgically with the workpiece(s) and solidifies in the capillary, forming a strong joint. [...] Unlike welding, the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is not melted. [...] Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of [...] [...] Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{case-hardening}} {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the carburization process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based case-hardening compound. This is collectively known as a carburizing pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into solid steel, and a typical depth of surface hardening with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern carburizing, such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E
50|$|The {{grinding}} machine {{consists of a}} bed with a fixture to guide and hold the <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> and a power-driven grinding wheel spinning at the required speed. The speed {{is determined by the}} wheel’s diameter and manufacturer’s rating. The grinding head can travel across a fixed <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> or the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> can be moved while the grind head stays in a fixed position.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, through the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit {{back to the}} plasma cutter via a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E

Usually the visible part of the light spectrum is used to discriminate between good and bad <b>work</b> <b>pieces.</b> However, in several applications a combination or even a substitution with the near infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum advances the evaluation.

50|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} {{is based on}} a very short {{electromagnetic}} pulse (<100µs), which is obtained by a fast discharge of capacitors through low inductance switches into a coil. The pulsed current with a very high amplitude and frequency (500kA and 15 kHz) produces a high-density magnetic field, which creates an eddy current in one of the <b>work</b> <b>pieces.</b> Repulsive Lorentz forces are created and a high magnetic pressure well beyond the material yield strength causing acceleration and one of the <b>work</b> <b>pieces</b> impacts onto the other part with a collision velocity up to 500 m/s.|$|R
