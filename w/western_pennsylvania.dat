5|$|Throughout <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> counties, protesters used {{violence}} and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance {{came to a}} climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax—in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania {{invented a}} {{drilling}} process to extract oil {{from deep within}} the earth. Drake's invention is credited with giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|The village {{began to}} develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh {{resident}} and state legislator, introduced a bill {{that resulted in a}} gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The Academy later developed as the University of <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|William McKinley Jr. {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (née Allison) McKinley (1809–1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who {{was born in}} Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1915 {{season was}} a success, the next year's team {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, and Warner became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel was the costliest, deadliest, and strongest {{hurricane}} in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, {{and second}} major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> the next day.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the Pittsburgh Bankers of the <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Hockey League signed Stuart to a {{professional}} contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Victorias, who also claimed him. Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart; the following year they would also sign Bruce. Stuart was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh. Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point {{in the league in}} 1903.|$|E
5|$|McAleer {{was born}} in Youngstown, Ohio, an {{industrial}} center located near the border of <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania.</b> His father, Owen McAleer, died at a young age, leaving McAleer's mother, Mary, to support three children. The family lived on the city's west side, where the McAleer children were raised to value the concept of formal education. McAleer attended local public schools and graduated from Rayen High School. In later years, {{all three of the}} McAleer brothers moved on to successful careers, and the oldest, Owen McAleer, Jr., served for a time as mayor of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E

5|$|On May 3 McClellan re-entered federal {{service as}} {{commander}} of the Department of the Ohio, responsible {{for the defense of}} the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and, later, <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> western Virginia, and Missouri. On May 14, he was commissioned a major general in the regular army. At age 34, he outranked everyone in the Army except Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, the general-in-chief. McClellan's rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary and former Ohio governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Rep. William C. Kortz {{and retired}} {{manufacturer}} Joseph Vodvarka also {{ran in the}} Democratic primary, but neither remained {{for the duration of}} the race. Kortz, who was little known outside the <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> area, dropped out of the race on January 14, 2010 after raising only $20,000 of the $2 million he sought to raise for his campaign. Vodvarka, an Allegheny County man who had been mostly overlooked throughout the race, was formally removed from the ballot in mid-April 2010 after it was revealed he failed to garner the minimum amount of signatures for a nominating petition.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{excise tax}} {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania.</b> In June, Neville was burned in effigy by {{a crowd of}} about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.|$|E
50|$|Previously, a 1902 {{truss bridge}} {{stood on the}} site. It was {{replaced}} by the current bridge in 1986, as part of a major rehabilitation project along <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania's</b> rivers; it shares its construction style with a variety of other bridges assembled during the same era. The Youghiogheny River Trail features a parking facility adjacent to the bridge's western approach.|$|R
50|$|Eventually the Delta {{formation}} {{was buried}} and transformed into sandstone, {{which was then}} revealed in places when the Catskill and Appalachian Mountains were formed at a later date. This transformation and uncovering is the primary reason why the Catskill Delta is notable in the present; <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania's</b> petroleum was formed as a consequence. This {{was the first major}} oil region to be developed.|$|R
50|$|The Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in <b>western</b> {{and central}} <b>Pennsylvania,</b> <b>western</b> Maryland and West Virginia, and southeastern Ohio. It {{is a major}} coal-bearing unit in the Appalachian Plateau of the eastern United States.|$|R
5|$|The Panic of 1873 put {{a damper}} on this growth, and in the interim the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in <b>Western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> and the Midwest on one side and labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C., {{were among the}} most {{damaging}} from a tropical cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over <b>western</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New York and New England were {{relatively}} minor and primarily limited to wind damage. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean.
