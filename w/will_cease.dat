5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> to exist.|$|E
5|$|While {{purchasing}} {{a plot of}} land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As {{he is about to}} kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to NIMHANS where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, the chief psychiatrist of the hospital uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. The psychiatrist declares that Remo <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> to exist if Nandini accepts Ambi's love, but Anniyan <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that the masters, whom they are both familiar with, will use him if he tries to use them.|$|E
5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> to exist in the near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000â€“130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use <b>will</b> <b>cease</b> by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} four years later, where Marley forces {{including}} Titan Shifters like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training to inherit their powers are fighting against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously harm and even kill the most well fortified Titan Shifters. Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony <b>will</b> <b>cease.</b> As the Marleyan military prepares for another attempt to invade Paradis, Eren infiltrates the country by assuming the disguise of a wounded and amputated soldier named Mr. Kruger who uses Falco Grice, one of the prospective warriors who desire to inherit the Armored Titan to gain information. The Tyburs, an influential and highly-respected political clan led by Willy who is the current holder of the War Hammer Titan, secretly control the Marley government and decide to assist the warriors for the imminent invasion of Paradis.|$|E
