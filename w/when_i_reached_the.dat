500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it. Well, sir, I was very weak <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> hut." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{would have}} been {{nothing short of a}} crime for me to have retired <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> age of sixty, because I have {{accomplished}} far more the last twenty years of my life than I did before I reached my sixtieth birthday ... I was put in this world for a purpose and that was not to loaf and spend my time in so-called pleasure ... I was eighty years old when I thought out the practicability of starting a passenger steamship line of eight steamers to run around the world in one direction ... I hope to continue working to my last day on earth and wake up the next morning in the other world.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 September 1988, having {{climbed the}} {{mountain}} via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin {{made the first}} paraglider descent of Everest, [...] in the process creating {{the record for the}} fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: [...] "I was tired <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard." [...] Boivin ran [...] from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at [...] in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes). Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, base-jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see; you can't {{reply to}} a message you didn't get. But I'll send him round <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> garage, if you like--and there's the telephone." ...|$|R

5000|$|Swaziland Football Association {{president}} Adam Mthehwa {{requested a}} $30k payment as his [...] "gratuity {{will only be}} paid to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> age of 55 in 2010" ...|$|R
2500|$|On 14 July 1985 Boivin again {{broke the}} {{altitude}} {{record for a}} hang glider by launching from the summit of Gasherbrum II (he had reached the [...] summit the week before, on 8 July, and reclimbed the mountain to make his jump). On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Mount Everest, [...] in the process creating {{the record for the}} fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: [...] "I was tired <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard."

6000|$|... "Leaping, you know, is a froglike accomplishment," [...] {{continued}} the Frogman modestly, [...] "but {{please tell me}} what I am to do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} wall." ...|$|R
60|$|Then he said slowly:--"In {{despite the}} many {{weaknesses}} of your education, {{you have been}} good to me. I will speak of your tobacco <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Gods. <b>I</b> owe you much thanks for many kindnesses.|$|R
5000|$|Allal Soudani ("The dreamer")- His {{grandparents}} M'Barkou and Barkatou {{were brought}} from Sudan as slaves. [...] "When I play I {{no longer feel}} my body, I empty myself.

60|$|Moving the opera-glass {{slowly along}} the {{semicircle}} formed by the seats, I suddenly stopped <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> middle.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed them}} both, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> crown I was riding {{level with the}} little, {{hard-faced}} English huntsman.|$|E

50|$|The {{governor}} of Madeira ended {{the reference to}} this colony with a prayer and a plea: May Our Lord in His mercy, {{pave the way to}} get them help, and my intention is to go to the said path of coastline <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Island of São Francisco, which we can do on a single trip. This possible colony may have lasted at least until the 1570s, or {{until the end of the}} century.|$|R
5000|$|DeWyze {{has some}} of the lyrics to [...] "Miles From Nowhere", words from a classic Cat Stevens song that say, [...] "Lord, my body has been a good friend but I won't need it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> end" [...] tattooed on his arm. He has three other tattoos, {{including}} a silhouette of the Chicago flag and tree of life on his right arm and a Shel Silverstein illustration on his left arm.|$|R
60|$|I {{have only}} to add, that the verdict at the Coroner's Inquest was Wilful Murder against some person, or persons, unknown. Mr. Ablewhite's family have offered a reward, and no effort has been left untried to {{discover}} the guilty persons. The man dressed like a mechanic has eluded all inquiries. The Indians have been traced. As to the prospect of ultimately capturing these last, I shall have a word {{to say to you}} on that head, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> end of the present Report.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> deck, I saw {{no one but}} a {{large man}} in a large {{dripping}} pea-jacket, who was calking down the main-hatches.|$|E
60|$|That {{moment came}} quickly. The steamer {{was not a}} hundred feet from me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> deck. It passed me on the port side.|$|E
60|$|I did so. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> glade I found Indaba-zimbi {{kindling}} a {{small fire}} {{under the shadow of}} a tree by the edge of the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go {{in first}} in my merchant's dress, which I have here. I will stop a little way inside the gate, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see you coming, will walk on.

50|$|This example {{shows the}} {{systematic}} process {{that takes place}} whilst the algorithm is processed. The initial value of x is zero, but i, although defined, has not been assigned a value. Thus, its initial value is unknown. As we execute the program, line by line, the values of i and x change, reflecting each statement of the source code in execution. Their new values are recorded in <b>the</b> trace table. <b>When</b> <b>i</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> value of 11 because of the i++ statement in the for definition, the comparison i <= 10 evaluates to false, thus halting the loop. As we also <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> end of the program, the table test also ends.|$|R
60|$|It {{was half}} past five <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> station. A sleepy porter {{informed}} me {{that there would be}} a train to London, a slow train, at six.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone!" [...] Percy {{answered}} furiously. [...] "Eloped to Paris with Captain Bervie! Read her own confession. They {{were just}} sending the messenger with it, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> house." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} we started for Fin-ma-Coul's Crossing. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> shooting-box, where Guy was {{entertaining}} a select company of friends, Flora Billingsgate greeted me with a saucy smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must make}} my excuses for {{turning up in}} this condition," [...] he apologized. [...] "I had to start for the {{railroad}} at a moment's notice, and it rained all <b>the</b> way, while, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> it, <b>the</b> train was in the depôt.

60|$|The last {{notes of}} the {{introduction}} to the opera were being played, and the seats in the pit were all filled, <b>when</b> Pesca and <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> theatre.|$|R
5000|$|This {{case was}} covered nationally, {{and the mayor}} {{attracted}} wide media coverage. He has interviewed by such news organizations as CBC News, Agence France-Presse, The Cross, and Sun Media. In late March 2011, the appellate court authorized the Mayor and City Saguenay to appeal the decision. Mayor Tremblay said, [...] "... This battle, I do it because <b>I</b> love Christ. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> other side, <b>I</b> {{can be a little}} proud. I will say, [...] "I fought for you, I even went on trial for you." [...] On July 12, 2011, Canadian Press said the mayor's fundraising campaign had raised $181,000, compared to the MLQ, which had received $25,000 in that period. The hearing was scheduled for Monday, November 26, 2012 in Quebec before Judge France Thibault. Tremblay argued that the prayer was part of the Catholic heritage of Quebec.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> porch I found Mrs. Canby bidding {{my sister}} good-by. A moment more {{and she was}} on the seat. I touched up Jerry and we were off.|$|E
60|$|To remain {{where we}} were would have been suicidal. We were both {{standing}} now, Victory keeping her place bravely at my side, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> only decision open to me.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked her}} and hurried on. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> street, I found the numbers {{ran in the}} three hundreds, and I had quite a walk to the southward to reach No. 28.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> Robin and <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> abode {{of our old}} friend--in a state, let me add, {{of almost}} irrepressible excitement--we found her seated in the old arm-chair by the window, gazing sadly out on the prospect.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> assailant and {{his victim}} {{it was a}} fearful sight I looked upon. The face of the lunatic was ghastly and his wild eyes almost started from their sockets in his rage.|$|R
60|$|Her manner was defiant, {{her tone}} was positive; I doubted both. Under the surface of her assumed confidence, I saw {{something}} which {{told me that she}} was trying to read my thoughts in my face. Many other women had tried to do that. They succeeded <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> wrong side of fifty, my face had learned discretion, and they failed.|$|R
