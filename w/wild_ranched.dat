50|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>ranching</b> {{is by far}} the {{cheapest}} of all forms of scallop farming and can be very effective when large areas of seabed can be utilized. However, there can often be problems with predators such as crabs and starfish so areas must be cleared and then fenced to some degree. However, clearing and fencing will not prevent settlement of larvae of predators. Harvesting is usually done by dredge further reducing costs. On smaller farms, however, divers may be employed to harvest.|$|R

30|$|Promotion of eco-tourism {{and game}} {{ranching}} {{may be a}} suitable solution in a few cases, but large scale replication may pose both economic and ecological difficulties. Would these solutions eventually encourage a neglect of overall biological diversity in favour of an artificial (managed) ecosystem dominated by charismatic and photogenic species? This could be the danger {{from all of the}} pastoral conservancy approaches in the future; replacing pastoral systems with <b>wild</b> game <b>ranches</b> on a large scale may also have this unintended effect.|$|R
5000|$|California Frank's {{company and}} the 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show participated in the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, marking the {{beginning}} of their relationship with the larger outfit both at the 101 headquarters in Oklahoma (the Millers were neighbors of Pawnee Bill) and at times performing with the 101 on the road. C.F. Hafley's show was not on as grand a scale as the 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West, but they had quality acts excelled by few to none at the time: Lillian Smith was better known as [...] "Princess Wenona," [...] world champion horseback sharpshooter, Ada Sommerville on her magnificent horse, Columbus, danced to the [...] "Merry Widow Waltz," [...] and Mamie Francis began her daring horse diving act in 1908 at Dreamland on Coney Island, NYC.|$|R
50|$|The Arabian oryx {{was only}} saved from {{extinction}} through a captive breeding program and reintroduction to the wild. The scimitar oryx, {{which is now}} listed as Extinct in the Wild, also relies on a captive breeding program for its survival. Small populations of several oryx species, such as the scimitar oryx, exist in Texas and New Mexico (USA) in <b>wild</b> game <b>ranches.</b> Gemsboks were released at the White Sands Missile Range and have become an invasive species of concern at the adjacent White Sands National Monument.|$|R

50|$|The Wild Horse Adult Resort and Spa was {{an adult}} {{entertainment}} complex about 14 mi east of Reno, Nevada, USA {{that is home to}} two separate legal, licensed brothels: the <b>Wild</b> Horse <b>Ranch</b> and the Mustang Ranch. The property is located in a secluded portion of the Patrick Business Park, in the far northern portion of Storey County, at 1000 Wild Horse Canyon Drive, Sparks, NV 89434. Primary access to the area is via exit 28 off Interstate 80. The nearby settlement of Patrick, from which the Business Park takes its name (and occupants their mailing addresses), is actually found across the Truckee River and thus is located in Washoe County.|$|R
50|$|The 101 Ranch {{written by}} Ellsworth Collings in {{collaboration}} with Alma Miller England, narrates {{the history of the}} famed Miller Brothers 101 Ranch, the Miller Brothers 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show, and the Miller family who founded and operated both the ranch and the show. The 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show {{was one of the last}} of the large Wild West Shows. The history spans from 1841, Col. George Washington Miller Jr.'s birth, until 1936, when the last piece of property was auctioned off following the economic downturn of 1929. At its height, the ranch encompassed more than 110,000 acre in parts of Noble, Pawnee, Osage, and Kay counties in north central Oklahoma. The appendices list the legal description of the land owned by the ranch as well as its Indian leases. The book contains some 53 photographs depicting the family, the work on the <b>ranch,</b> the <b>Wild</b> West show, as well as the many cowboys, noted visitors, and many Indians employed or living on the ranch.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1907, the Miller Brothers 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show {{began the}} tour circuit in Brighton Beach, New York. Joe Miller, the eldest son, was an {{exceptional}} equestrian and star performer. Over {{the course of}} the show's history, its cast included Lillian Smith, Bill Picket, Bessie Herberg, Bee Ho Gray, Tom Mix, Jack Hoxie, Mexican Joe, Ross Hettan, and an elderly Buffalo Bill.|$|R
5000|$|Beth Hagendorf {{was raised}} on a 6,000-acre cattle ranch, Tait Ranch, in Columbus, Texas. She grew up a sporty tomboy, riding 4-wheelers, and running <b>wild</b> on the <b>ranch.</b> Hagendorf's mother {{died at the age}} of 49 after battling cancer for seven brave years. [...] Hagendorf {{graduated}} from Texas A&M University in 3 years with a Bachelor of Science in Sociology and minor in Psychology.|$|R

5000|$|In 1910, Will A. Dickey, {{owner of}} the Circle D <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show and Indian Congress, signed a deal to provide stock and wranglers for the Selig motion picture company. Dickey had seen Mix perform with the Miller Brothers 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show {{and asked him if}} he would be {{interested}} in appearing in films. Mix agreed and soon after joined the Selig unit in Flemington, Missouri. Mix's earliest films were made as part of one of Selig's travelling units. Location work for these films were done in Missouri and Oklahoma while at least one film was made in Chicago. [...] Otis Skinner, the director of these films, was impressed with Mix's screen image and wanted to keep him working as a film actor. Mix, however, was not interested in remaining in films and signed with Zack Mulhall's Wild West Show to help organize the Appalachian Exposition in Knoxville, Tennessee, which was scheduled to run in October and November. [...] After this Mix rejoined the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Show.|$|R
40|$|In December 1990, at its General Assembly {{meeting in}} Perth, Western Australia, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) carried a {{resolution}} entitled "Conservation of wildlife through wise {{use as a}} renewable natural resource" (see Appendix). Running to two pages and comprising many clauses and caveats, the {{crucial part of the}} resolution is that given in Article 1 "... that ethical, wise and sustainable use of some wildlife can provide an alternative or supplementary means of productive land use, and can be consistent with and encourage conservation, where such is in accordance with adequate safeguards... ". Article 5 refers to the need for the development of guidelines for such use. This was the origin of the workshop 2 ̆ 7 s goal. Wildlife can be defined as undomesticated native animals and uncultivated native plants. The commercial use of wildlife may be in the form of harvesting from the <b>wild,</b> <b>ranching</b> or farming. It can be consumptive or non-consumptive and involve a wide range of plant and animal taxa in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Use can be made of live as well as dead products, both locally and as an export. Sustainability can be defined as the capacity for long-term maintenance of harvests that do not reduce the species 2 ̆ 7 geographic range or existing patterns of genetic variability, or radically alter community structure and function. It {{should be noted that the}} commercial use of wildlife is in no way a novelty, with fisheries and forestry providing two striking examples of established commercial use. What is new (or newer), is the notion of identifying conservation benefits from wildlife harvesting, and the possible introduction of hitherto unexploited species for a conservation gain...|$|R
5000|$|Halfway {{through his}} bucking career, in 1965, Shoulders put Tornado {{up for a}} $500 prize to anyone who could ride him at the 101 <b>Wild</b> West <b>Ranch</b> Rodeo. The offer was open to anyone at all, not just bull riders, {{as long as they}} were of legal age. Obviously, no one won the prize. Also, at the NFR in 1967 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, one {{prominent}} notable tried and failed to ride him. ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull rider Myrtis Dightman tried and failed when he took on Tornado. Lastly, after [...] "The Ride," [...] with Freckles Brown, Tornado was ridden four more times. The second time Brown rode him was in Miami, Florida. Few recall that second ride. Three more bull riders rode Tornado. So, in total, Tornado was ridden five times.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Clinton OK at the Clinton Indian Hospital, Little Thunder {{was raised}} in the town of Canton, Oklahoma, in the Southern Cheyenne {{community}} of Fonda. His great-grandfather, Frank Old Bear, performed with the Miller 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show. His uncle, Raymond Williams, was an amateur artist who could look at something once and then reproduce it but never turned his talent into a career. Little Thunder described growing up in Canton as [...] "an Indian kid's paradise." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} included were {{a working}} {{model of the}} Panama Canal, a replica of New York City (complete with skyscrapers), and a scale model of the Colorado Grand Canyon. One popular attraction was the 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West show which had been shipped over from Oklahoma.

6000|$|Then a Nevada paper {{chronicles the}} {{departure}} of a mining party from Reno: [...] "The toughest set of roosters that ever shook the dust off any town left Reno yesterday for the new mining district of Cornucopia. They came here from Virginia. Among the crowd were four New York cock-fighters, two Chicago murderers, three Baltimore bruisers, one Philadelphia prize-fighter, four San Francisco hoodlums, three Virginia beats, two Union Pacific roughs, and two check guerrillas." [...] Among the far-west newspapers, have been, or are, The Fairplay (Colorado) Flume, The Solid Muldoon, of Ouray, The Tombstone Epitaph, of Nevada, The Jimplecute, of Texas, and The Bazoo, of Missouri.

40|$|An 8 -year-old elk (or wapiti; Cervus elaphus canadensis) cow was {{presented}} to a local veterinarian in July 2012 {{with a history of}} marked weight loss and lethargy. The elk resided on a 130 -ha <b>wild</b> game <b>ranch</b> north of Prince Albert, Sas-katchewan, Canada, in a herd of approximately 30 animals; none of the animals were vaccinated and none had been dewormed recently. Approximately 95 % of the animals had been born on the property; the remainder was bred on neigh-boring elk farms. Ticks had not been noted on the animals, but a large infestation of horse flies (Tabanus spp.), with approximately 100 – 200 flies per animal, was observed. Within the previous 1 – 2 weeks, 9 bull elk were found dead in various locations around the property. Unlike the elk cow, the bulls had been in excellent body condition. No necrop-sies had been performed due to rapid decomposition of th...|$|R
50|$|Bainbridge {{was born}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1885. At the age of 17 he began working as a bill poster for the Sells-Forepaugh Brothers Circus. He later {{advanced}} to working as a press agent for the Barnum & Bailey Circus. He also worked with theaters in Chicago during summers and with the The 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show during the winter. He later relocated to Minneapolis and, from the 1920s through the 1930s, he managed the Shubert Theater.

5000|$|The Dolls {{were four}} of seven {{children}} born to Emma and Gustav Schneider in Stolpen, Germany (the other three were average-sized). Harry and Grace were {{the first of the}} quartet to perform in sideshows, as [...] "Hansel and Gretel". In 1914, American entrepreneur Bert W. Earles saw them and brought them to the United States to tour with the 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show. The siblings lived in Pasadena, California, with the Earles family. Earles also brought Daisy and Tiny to the United States (in 1922 and 1926, respectively), where they joined Harry and Grace in their act.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 Laemmle and Universal chose Jack to star as Buffalo Bill Cody in Metropolitan Pictures' The Last Frontier, co-starring William Boyd. The film {{would prove}} {{enormously}} successful and Hoxie is often best recalled for {{his performance in}} the film. In 1927, however, Hoxie became dissatisfied with his contract at Universal and refused to renegotiate for another stint at the studio. He would continue throughout the late '20s making films of lesser quality with lower-rank film studios. He made his last silent film, Forbidden Trail, in 1929 before pursuing further work in circuit rodeos, carnivals and the Miller Brothers 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show.|$|R
5000|$|Bee Ho added {{a trained}} coyote named [...] "Chink" [...] {{to be part}} of his act in the early 1930s, and began making radio {{appearances}} with his witty Oklahoma comedy. He appeared on stage and on the radio with personalities such as Bing Crosby, Will Rogers, Fred Stone, Joe E. Brown (comedian), Mary Beth Hughes, Eddie Nugent, Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard and many others. Many of the western stars who performed {{in the first half of}} the 1900s got their start with him at the Miller Brothers 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West as they saw their way of life on the open range disappearing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, Pickett {{joined the}} 101 <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show that {{featured}} {{the likes of}} Buffalo Bill, Will Rogers, Tom Mix, Bee Ho Gray, and Zach and Lucille Mulhall; he performed under the name [...] "The Dusky Demon." [...] Pickett was soon a popular performer who toured {{around the world and}} appeared in early motion pictures, such as a movie created by Richard E. Norman. [...] Pickett's ethnicity resulted in his not being able to appear at many rodeos, so he often was forced to claim that he was of Comanche heritage in order to perform. In 1921, he appeared in the films The Bull-Dogger and The Crimson Skull.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 Wiedemann {{used this}} {{equipment}} {{to start a}} Wild West Show called [...] "Kit Carson Buffalo <b>Ranch</b> <b>Wild</b> West Show". This was actually a combination circus and wild west show, and the performance was presented in a tent rather than the usual canvas canopy and open air arena type performance used by most wild west shows. The Kit Carson show had many circus-type acts. For 1911 one train inventory shows a total of 12 cars, 1 advance, 3 stocks, 5 flats, and 3 coaches. Another shows 14 cars, 1 advance, 3 stocks, 6 flats, and 4 coaches. (Both may be right, as it's possible the show enlarged entour.) ...|$|R
