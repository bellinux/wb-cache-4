40|$|The paper {{presents}} the multi-wafer bonding technology {{as well as}} the integration of electrical connection to the z-scanner wafer of the micromachined array-type Mirau interferometer. A Mirau interferometer, which is a key-component of optical coherence tomography (OCT) microsystem, consists of a microlens doublet, a MOEMS Z-scanner, a focus-adjustment spacer and a beam splitter plate. For the integration of this MOEMS device heterogeneous bonding of Si, glass and SOI wafers is necessary. Previously, most of the existing methods for multilayer wafer bonding require annealing at high temperature, i. e., 1100 degrees C. To be compatible with MEMS devices, bonding of different material stacks at temperatures lower than 400 degrees C has also been investigated. However, if more components are involved, it becomes less effective due to the alignment accuracy or degradation of surface quality of the not-bonded side after each bonding operation.

Mirau interferometer {{is suitable for}} MEMS metrology and for medical imaging according to its vertical-, lateral- resolutions and working distances. Miniaturized Mirau interferometer can be a promising candidate as {{a key component of}} an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. The miniaturized array-type interferometer consists of a microlens doublet, a Si-based MEMS Z scanner, a spacer for focus-adjustment and a beam splitter. Therefore, bonding technologies which are suitable for heterogeneous substrates are of high interest and necessary for the integration of MEMS/MOEMS devices. Multi-stack anodic bonding, which meets the optical and mechanical requirements of the MOEMS device, is adopted to integrate the array-type interferometers. First, the spacer and the beam splitter are bonded, followed by bonding of the MEMS Z scanner. In the meanwhile, two microlenses, which are composed of Si and glass wafers, are anodically bonded to form a microlens doublet. Then, the microlens doublet is aligned and bonded with the scanner/spacer/beam splitter stack. The bonded array-type interferometer is a 7 - <b>wafer</b> <b>stack</b> and the thickness is approximately 5 mm.
