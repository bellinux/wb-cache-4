5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the <b>wet</b> <b>runway</b> conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Sección de Investigación de Accidentes of Guatemala's Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil.

40|$|Recent {{work on the}} {{traction}} of pneumatic {{tires on}} <b>wet</b> <b>runways</b> is discussed, and it is shown that a loss of tire traction adversely affects cross-wind landings. The effect of runway surface texture is discussed,, and a simple method for measuring surface texture is described. A preliminary correlation of tire traction with surface texture is shown. Results of work at Langley Research Center {{on the use of}} air jets to improve tire traction on <b>wet</b> or flooded <b>runways</b> indicate that this is a promising approach for alleviating the large losses in tire braking and sideways traction that occur when tire hydroplaning occurs on a flooded runway...|$|R
25|$|On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed TriStar (registration: G-BBAI) overran {{the runway}} at Leeds/Bradford Airport on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The {{aircraft}} was evacuated, with only minor injuries {{sustained by the}} 14 crew and 398 passengers. The nose landing gear strut folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to {{the underside of the}} forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness, and recommended that both the scheduled <b>wet</b> <b>runway</b> performance of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport should be re-examined.|$|E
25|$|The crew, {{after finding}} the plane controllable, decided {{to fly a}} {{racetrack}} holding pattern close to Changi airport while assessing {{the status of the}} aircraft. It took 50 minutes to complete this initial assessment. The first officer and supervising check captain (SCC) then input the plane's status to the landing distance performance application (LDPA) for a landing 50 tonnes over maximum landing weight at Changi. Based on these inputs the LDPA could not calculate a landing distance. After discussion the crew elected to remove inputs related to a <b>wet</b> <b>runway,</b> in the knowledge that the runway was dry. The LDPA then returned the information that the landing was feasible with 100 metres of runway remaining. The flight then returned to Singapore Changi Airport, landing safely after the crew extended the landing gear by a gravity drop emergency extension system, at 11:45a.m. Singapore time. As a result of the aircraft landing 35 knots faster than normal, four tyres were blown.|$|E

Its nose wheel collapsed and its hull and righthand engine were damaged, but no injuries were reported. The aircraft proved too expensive to repair and is stored in Mwanza pending resolution of a claim with the airline's insurer.|$|E
40|$|Safety grooving, {{the cutting}} of grooves in {{concrete}} to increase traction and prevent injury, was first developed to reduce aircraft accidents on <b>wet</b> <b>runways.</b> Represented by the International Grooving and Grinding Association (IG&GA), the industry expanded into highway and pedestrian applications. The technique originated at Langley, which assisted in testing the grooving at airports and on highways.

40|$|The braking {{performance}} of a nine-place, light, twin-engine airplane was evaluated on comparative grooved and ungrooved surfaces of the landing research runway at NASA Wallops Station. The test airplane was equipped with manual braking on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear, and its weight varied from 33. 4 to 35. 6 kN (7500 to 8000 Ib). The test results indicate that pavement grooving significantly improves aircraft braking and directional control on <b>wet</b> <b>runways.</b> Measurements and observations of airplane tire treads made during this test program showed no indication of unusual wear and/or damage attributable to grooved surfaces. Comparative braking data obtained with a jet fighter and a civil and a military jet transport are also presented. Includes bibliographical references (p. 13 - 14).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study {{the performance of a}}n aircraft tire under cyclic braking conditions and to study the performance of a currently operational aircraft antiskid braking system. Dry, damp, and flooded runway surface conditions were used in the investigation. The results indicated that under cyclic braking conditions the braking and cornering-force friction coefficients may be influenced by fluctuations in the vertical load, flexibility in the wheel support, and the spring coupling between the wheel and the tire-pavement interface. The cornering capability was shown to be negligible at wheel slip ratios well below a locked-wheel skid under all test surface conditions. The maximum available brake-force friction coefficient was shown to be dependent upon the runway surface condition, upon velocity, and, for <b>wet</b> <b>runways,</b> upon tire differences.

5000|$|Pilots of {{the early}} A-7s lauded the {{aircraft}} for general ease of flying (with the exceptions of poor stability on crosswind landings and miserable stopping performance on <b>wet</b> <b>runways</b> with an inoperative anti-skid braking system) and excellent forward visibility but noted a lack of engine thrust. This was addressed with A-7B and more thoroughly with A-7D/E. The turbofan engine provided {{a dramatic increase in}} fuel efficiency compared with earlier turbojets - the A-7D was said to have specific fuel consumption one sixth that of an F-100 Super Sabre at equivalent thrust. An A-7D carrying 12 x 500 lb (227 kg) bombs at 480 mph (775 km/h) at 33,000 ft (10,000 m) used only 3,350 lb (1,500 kg) of fuel per hour. Typical fuel consumption at mission retrograde during aircraft carrier recovery was approximately 30 pounds per minute compared to 100+ pounds per minute for the Phantom F-4J/N series. [...] The A-7 Corsair II was tagged with the nickname [...] "SLUF" [...] ("Short Little Ugly Fucker") by pilots.|$|R

40|$|Thousands of {{landings}} {{in commercial}} transport-category (FAA, 2013) airplanes are executed {{every single day}} all over the world. Accurate touchdowns are crucial in saving excessive {{wear and tear on}} brakes, tires, and airplane structure. They are especially critical when landing on <b>wet</b> and/or contaminated <b>runways</b> or during LAHSO operations. Despite so much operational experience, the control of landing flare and touchdown accuracy is still a “hit or miss ” event. The statistics on touchdown points and the large scatter of data indicates that landings are not very accurate even when full auto-land capabilities are used (FAA, 2007). Large operational cushions (67 % for dry DLDR and 92 % for <b>wet</b> WLDR <b>runway)</b> are provided over (un-factored gross measured) demonstrated dry landing distance (gross DDLD) for airplanes used in commercial air transportation (e. g., Title 14 CFR 121). Contaminated runways may require 2 - 3 times longer runway lengths than DDLD (Daidzic & Shrestha, 2008; Daidzic, 2011 a). The highest frequency of transport-category airplane incident/accidents occurs indeed during the landing/rollout phase...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions. It is increasingly common for transverse grooves to be sawn in the runway surface for this purpose. Grooves introduce a number of potential distress mechanisms that are not present in an ungrooved surface including, rubber filling the grooves, reduction of groove depth due to surface erosion, groove edge break and groove closure. Groove loss by closure is the most concerning form of distress as this usually occurs early in the surface's life and cannot be corrected by re-sawing the grooves. Asphalt resurfacing and regrooving after removal of the closed grooves is required. In addition, maintenance activities such as crack filling, surface rejuvenation sprayed treatments, patching and resurfacing, require additional consideration when grooves are present. Despite the difficulties associated with grooves, sawing of grooves is now the most common method used for improving aircraft braking performance on <b>wet</b> asphalt <b>runways...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very short landing runs on <b>wet</b> or slippery <b>runways</b> while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system.|$|R
