25|$|During {{the course}} of the voyages, Ming China had become the {{pre-eminent}} naval power of the early 15th century. The Yongle Emperor had extended imperial control over foreign lands during the span of the voyages. However, in 1433, the voyages ceased and Ming China turned away from the seas. It is not exactly known why the voyages completely ended in 1433. Duyvendak suggested that the complete cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be, the costs for undertaking the voyages had not overburdened the Ming treasury. The trade was still flourishing long after the voyages had ceased. Chinese ships continued to control the Eastern Asian maritime trade. They also continued trading around India and East Africa.|$|E

Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term espace Plantagenet was acceptable.|$|E

McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show {{one of the first things}} we think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E

Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible except for a few minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando Borghi, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Angevin Empire" [...] {{was coined}} by Kate Norgate in 1887. There was no known {{contemporary}} collective name {{for all of}} the territories under the rule of the Angevin Kings of England. [...] This led to circumlocutions such as [...] "our kingdom and everything subject to our rule <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be" [...] or [...] "the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father". The [...] "Empire" [...] portion of [...] "Angevin Empire" [...] has been controversial, especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance, and each retained its own laws, traditions, and feudal relationships. [...] In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state, and therefore no [...] "Angevin Empire", but that the term espace Plantagenet (French for [...] "Plantagenet space") was acceptable. Nonetheless, historians have continued to use [...] "Angevin Empire".|$|E

As Newark's population approached {{a half million}} in the 1920s, the city's potential seemed limitless. It was said in 1927: [...] "Great is Newark's vitality. It is the red blood in its veins - this basic strength {{that is going to}} carry <b>it</b> over <b>whatever</b> hurdles <b>it</b> <b>may</b> encounter, enable <b>it</b> to recover from <b>whatever</b> losses <b>it</b> <b>may</b> suffer and battle its way to still higher achievement industrially and financially, making it eventually perhaps the greatest industrial center in the world".|$|R

[...] He drew upon {{inspiration}} for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from Picasso's [...] "Guernica", which depicts war-ravaged villagers. Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail wrote that Steiger's character [...] "seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man". Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of anti-Semitism, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{was hard}} at work on the {{manuscript}} for his [...] "big book" [...] on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that [...] "your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled" [...] and he would [...] "of course, at once write and offer to send [...] to any journal" [...] that Wallace chose, adding that [...] "all my originality, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> amount to, will be smashed". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled [...] On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.|$|E

2500|$|The term Angevin Empire is a {{neologism}} {{defining the}} lands of the House of Plantagenet: Henry II and his sons Richard I and John. Another son, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, ruled Brittany and established a separate line there. As far as historians know, there was no contemporary term for the region under Angevin control; however, descriptions such as [...] "our kingdom and everything subject to our rule <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be" [...] were used. The term Angevin Empire was coined by Kate Norgate in her 1887 publication, England under the Angevin Kings.

[...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous.

[...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family.
