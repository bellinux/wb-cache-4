500|$|Both {{his parents}} were {{interested}} in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as [...] "a normal Anglican upbringing". He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing." ...|$|E

Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever it <b>was,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E

The singer compared the song's sentiment to [...] "Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places", adding [...] "It's another confession". In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you [...] "losing yourself", which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, [...] "If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life." ...|$|E
