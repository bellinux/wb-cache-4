500|$|Pre-production for New Moon {{began in}} December 2008. Filming was {{scheduled}} to begin on March 23, 2009 in Vancouver, but began a few days early. Weitz envisioned a <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> palette for the sequel, contrary to the first film in the series, whose blue tones were prevalent. His intention resulted in golden tones, a change that was inspired by Italian paintings, and ultimately served {{as the basis for}} the crew's collaborative work. The approach also included the use of specific colors at certain points in the movie. For example, although Jacob's house is red, the color does not dominate until the climax of the movie. The director noted that, [...] "The square becomes a flood of red, that's how conscious we were of every visual aspect." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} for Treasure Planet, {{the crew}} operated on rule {{they call the}} [...] "70/30 Law" [...] (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi. The overall look of Treasure Planet {{was based on the}} art style promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration (such as Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the [...] "classic storybook illustration," [...] having a painterly feel to it, and being composed of a <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> palette. The animators took Deep Canvas, a technology which they had initially developed for Tarzan (1999), {{and came up with a}} process they called [...] "Virtual Sets," [...] wherein they created entire 360 degree sets before they began staging the scenes. They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a [...] "painted image with depth perception" [...] and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film. In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of Captain Hook from Peter Pan and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.|$|E
2500|$|The game's visuals {{were well}} {{received}} by critics. IGN reviewer Stephanie Lee lauded the visuals. She {{stated that the}} graphics are [...] "beautiful detail and [...] a <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> palette". Robert Workman of GameZone also gave high marks for SkyDrifts graphics. He felt that the planes were well modeled and that the environments provided [...] "a smooth looking package." [...] GameSpot's Sean Evans called the graphics [...] "visually striking, with impressive levels of detail." [...] He did cite occasional issues with locating powerups, which he attributed to [...] "overly saturated lighting effects". The game's soundtrack was a point of mediocrity among critics. IGN's Lee stated that SkyDrifts soundtrack [...] "doesn't stand out nor does it detract from the overall experience," [...] a sentiment shared with GameZone's Workman.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "temperature" [...] of a color {{also affects}} its {{perceived}} depth. <b>Warm</b> <b>colors</b> have red or yellow tones (including orange and yellow-green) and are associated psychologically with warmth and energy. Cool colors have more bluish undertones (including purples, aquas and greens) and are associated psychologically with serene, calm personalities. <b>Warm</b> <b>colors</b> tend to advance relative to cool colors, when both are presented simultaneously.|$|R
2500|$|... 20th-century Western {{painting}} {{begins with}} the heritage of late-19th-century painters Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others who were essential {{for the development of}} modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with [...] "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Matisse's second version of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{campus is}} housed on a [...] {{property}}. This property is largely covered with woodland and fresh-water swamp {{making it a}} very diverse wetland which {{is home to a}} number of somewhat rare plant species. The campus comprises 237 buildings and 5.1 million square feet (474,000 m²) of building space. The nearly universal use of bricks in the campus's construction — estimated at 14,673,565 bricks in late 2006 — prompted students to give it the semi-affectionate nickname [...] "Brick City," [...] reflected in the name of events such as the annual [...] "Brick City Homecoming." [...] Though the buildings erected in the first few decades of the campus's existence reflected the architectural style known as brutalism, the <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> of the bricks softened the impact somewhat. [...] More recent additions to the campus have diversified the architecture while still incorporating the traditional brick colors. In October 2013, Travel+Leisure named it as one of the ugliest college campuses in the United States, citing the monotone brick and the suburbanization, leaving almost no youth activities {{within walking distance of the}} campus.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not play games with similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a <b>warm</b> <b>color</b> palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't {{the only thing you can}} do with 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, along with the rest of the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 36 - 39) The Omnibus Personality Inventory, Form F, by Paul Heist and George Yonge {{was administered}} to 100 college students to determine the personality characteristics of introversion-extroversion. The results were analyzed in relation to responses to color preferences. The colors consisted of the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors in full intensity. No significant differences occurred in relation to color preferences and introversion -extroversion. Combined first, second, and third choices of <b>warm</b> <b>colors</b> as preferred colors were selected by 47 percent of the introverts while 49 percent of the extroverts chose <b>warm</b> <b>colors.</b> The cool colors selected as first, second and third choices combined were preferred by 53 per cent of the introverts and 51 per cent of the extroverts. Differences were not statistically significant. Research {{of a number of}} other investigators indicated different results, showing that introverts preferred cool colors, while extroverts preferred <b>warm</b> <b>colors</b> (20 : 182). This study has shown that <b>warm</b> <b>colors</b> are more popular with the respondents than has been shown in previous studies...|$|R
