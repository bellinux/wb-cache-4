25|$|<b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E

6000|$|... "Margaret!" [...] exclaimed her {{companion}} (she {{was a kind}} of heavy aunt), [...] "I told you not to make a scene in public. Mr. Quatermain, as Mr. Scroope is alive, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> him to be so good as to come here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, my dear fellow, {{it is at}} {{the hour}} of action that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When you pass Bradley's, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it {{convenient}} not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, {{surely not}} impossible," [...] she answered. [...] "Listen, Caron, {{there are two}} treasures in that coach. One is in money and in gold and silver plate; the other is in gems, and amounts to thrice {{the value of the}} rest. This latter is my dowry. It is a fortune with which we can quit France and betake {{ourselves}} wherever our fancy leads us. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me to abandon that and come to you penniless, compelled thereby to live in perpetual terror in a country where at any moment an enemy might cast at me the word aristocrate, and thereby ruin me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Look here, Small,' {{said the}} major. 'We {{have been talking}} it over, my friend here and I, and {{we have come to}} the {{conclusion}} that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.' He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. And <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{me to live}} in Ireland where I've {{been imposed}} on and kept in ignorance, and to die where the divil himself wouldn't take me as a gift, let alone the blessed angels? You can come or stay. You can take your old way or take my young way. But stick in this place I will not among a lot of good-for-nothing divils that'll not do a hand's turn but watch the grass growing and build up the stone wall where the cow walked through it. And Sir Horace Plunkett {{breaking}} his heart all the time telling them how they might put the land into decent tillage like the French and Belgians.|$|E
6000|$|His {{eyes did}} not fall before hers. [...] "And <b>would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>asking</b> him to come at once, Grizel?" [...] he said sweetly. She went {{straight}} to the doctor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> can <b>ask</b> mamma;--or rather, <b>you</b> {{had better}} give over {{thinking}} of it. I haven't had time yet even {{to make up}} my mind what you are like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There appears," [...] said Sally, {{turning to}} her companion, [...] "to be a hitch. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>asking</b> what's the matter? I don't know any French myself except 'oo la la!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think again," [...] she begged. [...] "You answer quickly, but is {{that because}} you are very, very sure, or because you are taking it for granted? You see {{you are one of}} those men, Stirling," [...] she went on earnestly, [...] "whose {{disposition}} does not allow them to look back. We are engaged, I was your deliberate choice, and after that, so far as you are concerned, the matter was ended. The possibility that you had made a mistake would never occur to you, simply because you would regard the matter as inevitable. Tell me, if it were not inevitable, if you were not engaged to me at this moment, Stirling, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{embraced her}} own child with {{extraordinary}} tenderness that morning, and even wept over it, calling it by a thousand fond names of maternal endearment [...] "Would I leave you, my darling--could I ever, ever, ever quit you, my blessing, and treasure!" [...] The unconscious little thing, hugged to his mother's bosom, and scared at her tones and tragic face, clung frightened and weeping round Laura's neck. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> what the husband's feelings were {{as he looked at}} that sweet love, that sublime tenderness, that pure Saint blessing the life of him unworthy? Of all the gifts of Heaven to us below, that felicity is the sum and the chief. I tremble as I hold it lest I should lose it, and be left alone in the blank world without it: again, I feel humiliated to think that I possess it; as hastening home to a warm fireside and a plentiful table, I feel ashamed sometimes before the poor outcast beggar shivering in the street.|$|E
60|$|Cronshaw is in London {{and would}} be glad to see you. He is living at 43 Hyde Street, Soho. I don't know where it is, but I daresay {{you will be able to}} find out. Be a brick and look after him a bit. He is very down on his luck. He will tell you what he is doing. Things are going on here very much as usual. Nothing seems to have changed since you were here. Clutton is back, but he has become quite impossible. He has quarrelled with everybody. As far as I can make out he hasn't got a cent, he lives in a little studio right away beyond the Jardin des Plantes, but he won't let anybody see his work. He doesn't show anywhere, so one doesn't know what he is doing. He may be a genius, but on the other hand he may be off his head. By the way, I ran against Flanagan the other day. He was showing Mrs. Flanagan round the Quarter. He has chucked art and is now in popper's business. He seems to be rolling. Mrs. Flanagan is very pretty and I'm trying to work a portrait. How much <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> if you were me? I don't want to frighten them, and then on the other hand I don't want to be such an ass as to ask L150 if they're quite willing to give L300.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said McMurdo sternly. [...] "It {{was only}} last night, {{as you know}} well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> be <b>asking</b> me to break my oath?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> dearest, to be {{very generous}} with him always, and very lenient on his faults {{when he is not}} by. I <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] he said. [...] "Now <b>would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>asking</b> {{yourself}} whether {{friendship between}} us is possible! Remember St. Ã‰tarpe, and ask yourself that! Remember our seat amongst the roses--remember {{what you will}} of that long golden day." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Roth wrote The Breast. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> him how {{he could}} do this since {{he had never been}} a breast? Adams wrote Watership Down. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{him how he}} could do this since he {{admitted}} his rabbit knowledge came from a book about rabbits? ... And those hobbits!... I am a bigger risk-taker than these others. The Hoosiers can contradict me. No rabbit, hobbit, or breast has been known to speak up in reply to their exploiters." ...|$|E

5000|$|Before Budah's departure, Rumata {{asks him}} a {{theological}} question: [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a god, {{if he could}} come from sky and fulfill any of your wishes?". After a long discussion - with Budah wishing and Rumata explaining the dire consequences {{of each of the}} wishes, Budah finally states that the only true gift a god could give the people is to leave them to their affairs. To this, Rumata replies that a god cannot bear the sight of their suffering.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I <b>would</b> have <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> him nothing. I {{would not}} wish {{that there should}} be {{opportunity}} for such asking. If there has been intimacy between you, such information should have come naturally,--as a thing of course. You have made him no promise?" ...|$|R
