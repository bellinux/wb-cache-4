25|$|In the season-opening Daytona 500, Earnhardt began well, even leading for a lap. However {{multiple}} misfortunes, {{including a}} missed pit stop and a 1-lap penalty for pitting {{outside of his}} pit box, sent him far {{into the back of}} the running order. Earnhardt was then directly involved in a controversial crash on lap 124, when, while fighting to return to the lead lap, he came in contact with Brian Vickers while fighting to be the first driver one lap down (<b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> free pass should the caution flag come out), causing a 10-car pileup which included Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle and Kurt Busch, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, and Carl Edwards. Vickers and Kyle Busch later criticized Earnhardt, who denied purposely clipping Vickers. Earnhardt criticized Vickers for blocking him on the inside. When the race concluded early due to the rain, Earnhardt ended with a 27th-place finish. Earnhardt later apologized for his actions but maintains to this day that he never intended to wreck Vickers.|$|E
500|$|Raymond {{took the}} war in Europe seriously enough to {{incorporate}} it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself {{involved in the conflict}} too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming [...] "restive about doing his duty", a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. [...] In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon/Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating [...] "I just had to get into this fight... I've always been the kind of guy <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> lump in his throat when a band plays the 'Star Spangled Banner'".|$|E

500|$|September Morn also {{inspired}} several films. A two-reel {{production by}} Pathé, titled September Morn, {{was released in}} February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> tattoo of the model. After his girlfriend disapproves, he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt, but this fails to gain his lover's approval; ultimately, he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text [...] "Votes for Women" [...] inked on his arm. Meanwhile, September Mourning, a November 1915 release produced by L-KO, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions {{of a young woman}} in the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for Moving Picture World, found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot. A third film, Lois Weber's Hypocrites, portrayed [...] "The Naked Truth" [...] (an uncredited Margaret Edwards) {{in a manner similar to}} Chabas's model.|$|E
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, I really like the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E
2500|$|The Dove Foundation {{praised the}} film, {{saying it is}} [...] "one of those movies that you find {{to be better than}} anticipated" [...] and also said the film draws on realism in family dynamics. Lara Martin of Digital Spy {{described}} the film as a [...] "kid-friendly mix of Men in Black crossed with Gremlins with a healthy dose of Home Alone-style violence" [...] and also mentioned that one of the biggest disappointments in the movie is the lack of screen time given to Tisdale, billed as one of the leading actors, <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> promising start as she rebels against her parents and struts around in her bikini, but she's quickly relegated to background fodder purely there to provide excess opportunities for the alien-controlled Ricky to shine and concluded saying it seems [...] "a bizarre and sad waste of her obvious comedic talent". However, The Miami Herald gave a mixed to negative review, saying the film is a [...] "children's movie mix of live-action and animation, it has a few positive messages, a few laughs and a few comic throwdowns".|$|E

2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course you hope you can make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E

This, I say, is the woman's snare; but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground, in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity, that by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not marry so soon as they may do otherwise, they would make themselves amends by marrying safer.
