25|$|In 1995 Lauro, doorman {{at a small}} Upper East Side {{apartment}} building, {{was arrested}} on burglary charges after a resident sent video from a hidden camera to police that apparently showed Lauro stealing from his apartment while on vacation. After his arrest the detectives were told he should be taken on a perp walk for cameras from a local TV station, to which the tenant had licensed his surveillance video. He was taken, in handcuffs, out to a police car, driven around the block and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
25|$|The logo {{starts the}} titles. During the {{animated}} titles, Dick and Dom are {{in bed and}} the hands from the logo wake them up, get out of bed, brush Dick and Dom's teeth, get their hair done, get them to the toilet and get them in the lift. At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played. Dick and Dom then <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lift. The doors closed and the show then switched to live broadcast, with Dick and Dom reemerging from the lift in casual clothes and quickly starting the show.|$|E
25|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether {{the release of the}} 15 British naval {{personnel}} had any coincidence with the release of a senior Iranian diplomat, Jalal Sharafi, who was taken hostage during a kidnapping in 2007. He was released on Tuesday, 3 April 2007, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Iranian embassy in Baghdad, although it is not clear who had abducted him. He was taken captive by a group of men dressed in uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion â€“ a special Iraqi unit under US direction. After his release, Sharafi claimed he had been kidnapped and tortured by American troops and agents of an Iraqi organisation acting {{under the supervision of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency. Signs of torture were reportedly found on Sharafi's body for which he received medical treatment. Iran also allegedly now has access to five Iranian nationals arrested in the US raid on Iranian liaison office in Arbil. An International Committee of the Red Cross team also visited the Iranian detainees. The British government however repeatedly stated that it made no deals with the United States or with Iran to secure the release of the detainees, and the timing of these events may be purely coincidental.|$|E

50|$|Albert {{tries to}} console Alexandra by {{telling her she}} is like a swan: on the water she looks serene, but on land she {{is more like a}} goose. Albert then offers Alexandra his arm and they <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mansion together.|$|R
500|$|Boyle's {{memory was}} indeed excellent. On one {{occasion}} he illustrated both {{the accuracy of}} his memory and the audacity of his character {{at the expense of}} a brother member. Edmond Stanley, anxious to produce an effect in an important debate, had been at pains to reduce his speech to writing. Unluckily, Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee-room, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> House unconscious of his loss. Sir Boyle, finding the document, speedily mastered its contents, and, rising at the first opportunity, delivered the speech almost verbatim in the hearing of its dismayed and astonished author. His apology afterward only added insult to injury: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take {{and walked out of the}} control room to plug in Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E

50|$|When Martin <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drugstore, {{he finds}} himself back in the 1959 Homewood, during the afternoon. He discovers that he now has a limp from the {{carousel}} injury, having unknowingly caused his younger self to fall off and injure his leg {{which in turn has}} given the adult Martin a limp. Martin makes {{his way back to the}} gas station. He picks up his car and drives away.|$|R
5000|$|While Hanna, Emily, and Alison enter Sara's {{hotel room}} closet in [...] "We've All Got Baggage", Alex, clothed as a maid, walks into another room. As the Liars escape, she <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room after having heard them making noise, and removes her disguise. Still wearing the maid gloves during the episode's {{concluding}} sequence, Alex reads a manual to a universal remote control. Next to them, is {{a slice of}} white wedding cake meaning they likely attended Byron and Ella's wedding.|$|R
60|$|The men {{apparently}} went away, and Maccario, who <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, {{smiled when}} he seated himself again.|$|E

50|$|Cassie <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{house where}} she bumps into Zombie a.k.a. Ben Parish. He tells her that he's going to the caverns to find Ringer and Teacup, so he can warn them about doomsday and bring them back. Cassie says he's only doing so because he feels guilty about leaving his baby sister to die, and he gets mad. Cassie tells him {{to do what he}} wants. Zombie takes Dumbo with him, and they leave the house that night to {{complete}} his mission.|$|R
50|$|She <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, bloodied and disorientated. She walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Jefferson Parish Police Department, {{immediately}} having {{guns drawn}} on her. Upon {{discovery of the}} twenty to thirty bodies at Honey Island Swamp, she is placed as the prime suspect in the murders by Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan), even after telling him numerous times about {{the events of the}} last two films. The Sheriff heads out to the swamp with the paramedics and fire department, leaving Deputy Winslow (Robert Diago DoQui) in charge of the station until he gets back.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994, BBC aired an [...] {{as part of}} [...] This version {{adapted the}} end of The Taming of a Shrew to round out the frame; after Sly announces he now knows how to tame a shrew, he proudly <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tavern to confront the hostess, but almost immediately, he is flung back out, {{in exactly the same}} way as the episode began. Directed by Aida Ziablikova and adapted from Shakespeare by Leon Garfield, it is voiced by Amanda Root and Nigel Le Vaillant, with Malcolm Storry as Sly.|$|R

50|$|The {{story begins}} during the {{instrumental}} {{introduction of the}} song. A girl sets a dining room table {{in a dark room}} lit only with two candles. A man appears from off screen and sits down opposite the girl. In the next sequence, the two of them are shown dancing within the catacombs, shown in silhouette and shadow. As <b>the</b> girl steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> light, the man lets her go and walks away. <b>The</b> song jumps <b>into</b> its heavy, fast-tempo riffs, and the video repeatedly cuts between shots of the guitarists and drummer while <b>the</b> girl slowly <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows.|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} he <b>walked</b> <b>back,</b> without ceremony, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main {{thoroughfare}} of the room.|$|R
25|$|The {{administration}} {{recognizes the}} threat Jurel poses to their social standing and forces {{him to resign}} before his deposition. After harsh criticism from Lisa, {{as well as her}} streaking down the school hallway naked (an allusion to Jurel's earlier accusation that she was unable to walk down the school halls 'naked' and see its true troubles), he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell, reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs. He also threatens to sue should he be fired. He proudly <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> school, with loud cheers from the school's students and Lisa looking on proudly.|$|R
60|$|Then {{when the}} chief <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car with several frock-coated individuals, Neale did {{recognize}} {{in the pale}} face of one a resemblance to the girl he loved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{assistance}} will be invaluable to me," [...] said O'Brien, with enthusiasm, {{and the two}} men parted in the hall. The Professor <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dining-room, {{where his}} sister was already seated at the luncheon-table.|$|E
60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bar whistling, and George Dixon, arter {{sitting still}} {{for a long time}} thinking, got up and went into the bar, and he'd 'ardly got his foot inside afore Charlie caught 'old of 'im by the {{shoulder}} and shoved 'im back into the parlour agin.|$|E
50|$|In the present, Vyasaraya appears {{with his}} goons and sarcastically {{mentions}} {{that it has}} been his pleasure to snatch Indira from Murthy every time. A fight ensues and Murthy takes down the goons. Vyasaraya, trying to escape, gets trapped on a railway track between one of the cross wedges. Seeing an oncoming train, he panics and is unable to pull his leg out.

50|$|James later visits Ted, {{who is now}} in jail (along with April) for the kidnapping. James tells Ted {{about the}} movie and how it is missing the most crucial part; the Brigsby voice. Ted agrees to record the voice of Brigsby and James {{finishes}} the movie. On premiere night, the show is sold out and James is worried that no one will like it and stays out of the theatre while the movie plays. When James <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, he is met with a standing ovation. Happy that the film is a success, James looks over to the stage, he sees Brigsby waving goodbye and disappears.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} the blacks were too {{astonished}} to act. They feared this apparition fully {{as much as}} they did Numa, yet they would gladly have slain the thing could they quickly enough have gathered together their wits; but fear and superstition and a natural mental density held them paralyzed while the ape-man stooped and gathered up the lion skin. They saw him turn then and <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows {{at the far end of}} the village. Not until then did they gain courage to pursue him, and when they had come in force, with brandished spears and loud war cries, the quarry was gone.|$|R
60|$|They {{took their}} leave, and Jocelyn Thew, {{almost as though}} against his will, <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> foyer, {{after a few minutes}} of hesitation, and sat there twirling the rose between his fingers, with his eyes fixed upon the {{interior}} of the restaurant. He had the air of one waiting.|$|E
60|$|He tore {{himself from}} {{her as he}} spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his {{resolution}} might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house, the happiest girl in all Utah.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{make up my mind}} what I ought to do, and I <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall. I glanced into the parlor, but it was unoccupied. Then I went into the large room on the right; no one was there, and I stood by the window trying to make up my mind in regard to proposing a brief stay at the inn.|$|E
50|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, the {{administration}} recognizes the threat Jurel poses to their social standing and forces him to resign before his deposition. After harsh criticism from Lisa, as well as her streaking down the school hallway naked (an allusion to Jurel's earlier accusation that she was unable to walk down the school halls 'naked' and see its true troubles), he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell, reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs.

50|$|As she {{is getting}} ready for the school dance, Jamie confronts Is, a figment of her {{imagination}} who tries to make Jamie like she is and acts as the main antagonist of the movie (next to Sawyer/Myrna), and tells her to stop. She then goes to the dance, where she tries to apologize to everyone. They do not accept her apology at first, but gradually do after learning the book was really Jamie's personal journal and that she never meant for it to be published. Jamie finds Connor just as he is leaving. She asks for his forgiveness and they kiss. They <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dance, where Lenny performs a song ("I Will Be Around") dedicated to Jamie.|$|R
50|$|As {{they realize}} {{that they have been}} robbed of the chance for a final goodbye, Alec's train arrives. With Dolly still chattering, Alec departs with a last look at Laura but without the passionate {{farewell}} for which they both long. After shaking Messiter's hand, he discreetly squeezes Laura on the shoulder and leaves. Laura waits for a moment, anxiously hoping that Alec will <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> refreshment room, but he does not. As the train is heard pulling away, Laura is galvanized by emotion and, hearing an approaching express train, suddenly dashes out to the platform. The lights of the train flash across her face as she conquers a suicidal impulse. She then returns home to her family.|$|R
