The estate comprised 333 acre, and incorporated a water wheel, a group of cottages, and a number of derelict farm buildings. In the weeks before assuming control of the farm Lawson travelled extensively throughout Britain seeking agricultural advice, visiting many good farms and farming districts; particularly those that applied ‘model farming’ techniques. Lawson began a programme of improvement. He bought an additional 87 acre of land. He changed the title to the ‘Model Farm’, then to Mechi, and later back to the Blennerhasset Farm. He removed miles of unwanted fences, thousands of tons of stone, constructed miles of new roads, and drained the <b>waterlogged</b> <b>land.</b> Besides the farming scheme, he also established a market garden, artificial manure works, a laboratory, a free library, a free school, a gas works, a medical dispensary and several grocery stores.

40|$|Abstract — The present paper assesses {{change in}} land use/land cover in Jind {{district}} of Haryana {{in a period}} of 1. 5 decades(1992 - 2008) using remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). For the study, Land use/Land cover (LULC) maps of two different years i. e. 1992 - 1993 and 2007 - 08, were prepared using multi-date satellite data. Land use/Land cover maps were prepared by digitization of different features through visual interpretation on satellite imagery using GIS software, after geometric correction of the satellite imageries. The total geographical area of Jind district was 274893 hac and it was categorized in built-up land, agricultural land, wasteland, water bodies, forest and transportation. The satellite data used for year 1992 - 93 was IRS-IA/IB LISS-I data with 72 m resolution, however satellite data for year 2007 - 08 was IRS-P 6 LISS-III data with 23. 5 m resolution. The agricultural land increased between 1992 - 93 and 2007 - 08, whereas fallow land decreased in the prescribed time period. There was an increase in built-up land from 1992 - 93 to 2007 - 08. The area under wasteland decreased due to increase in agricultural land and reclamation of salt-affected and <b>waterlogged</b> <b>lands.</b> The paper concludes that {{with the passage of time}} built-up increased with increase in human population and also man has reclaimed some wasteland and converted it to agricultural land to increase production for this increasing population...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} land use {{development}} in the model area Boží Dar, situated near the Czech-German border in the Krušné hory mountains, from 1845 to 2009. Based on an analysis of data taken from the LUCC Czechia Database, changes in land use patterns are explained and the primary driving forces, particularly societal forces, behind these changes are explored. This {{was made possible by}} analysing the historic-geographical development of the territory in question, focusing in particular on the last twenty years. Tendencies in land use development were similar to general trends for Czechia; however, they were more significant in the studied area. Major changes took place between 1949 and 1990. Besides the exodus of the Czech Germans after WW II, the primary factor of land use change was isolation, caused by the establishment of a border zone. Changes of similar importance, recorded in the 2000 - 2009 period, were caused by unique economic developments in Boží Dar. These are based on support for sustainable tourism, effectively drawing on financial resources from the EU and the active participation of local government administration.

40|$|ABSTRACT The São Francisco river {{discharge}} regularization, which regulates floods on the riverine population land, {{has promoted}} changes in land use associated {{to the implementation}} of irrigated areas, leading to a destruction of natural riverbank vegetation and an increase in soil and bank erosion. Past river and land use involved fishermen and landholders in a complex relationship which provided for the practice of both activities: fishing and agriculture, without any constraint. The objective of this work was to understand and analytically interpret the perception of the riverine population regarding the natural or artificial floods caused by the operation of dams in the São Francisco River Basin, in its lower course. A survey related to the perception of the riverine population concerning to flood occurrences at the lower Sao Francisco river municipalities was carried out, especially in regards to the 2004 flood, with the evaluation of the produced externalities through intentional and non-probabilistic questionnaires. To the riverine population, natural floods were always historically recognized as being positive, with the practice of agriculture on the flooded lands possible and also working as a nursery area for fish, promoting the local biodiversity conservation.

In the Gangetic flood plain of Indian state of West Bengal, wetlands are used as multiple system and have significant impacts on livelihoods of the local people through the most important benefit arising from fisheries, followed by wetland cultivation and jute retting. Integration of secondary reservoir or small tank in the tubewell based irrigation system has been demonstrated at Patna, India as an effective mechanism to better regulate water and also enhance water productivity by raising fish in the reservoir to generate additional income and improve livelihood. The technology of multiple use of canal water was also demonstrated at Bhubaneswar, India using service reservoir and gravity drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, and integrating fish culture in the ponds and raising horticulture on the pond embankments.

The role of soil mounding and mulching {{for the establishment}} of C. glauca was investigated in a factorial experiment involving 2 levels of soil mounding (nil, 0. 15 m) and 4 mulch conditions (nil, hay, black plastic, white plastic), and in a second experiment involving bagasse, soil amendment with calcium, and the installation of a double ridge in the mound. The low soil mounding had little effect on plant survival or growth, or soil conductivity; however, mulching greatly influenced these parameters (e. g. about 2 years after a summer planting, tree survival, tree growth, and surface soil conductivity in a plastic mulch treatment was 566, 210, and 60 %, respectively, of values of the no-mulch treatment, with a mean tree height of about 3 m in the plastic mulch treatment). Plastic mulch was recommended over hay or bagasse mulch for short-term (< 2 years) increase in plant survival and growth (e. g. 15 months after a summer planting, height of plants established in plastic mulch rows was 124 % of that in hay-mulched rows). The incorporation of a small trough in the crown of the bed was found to improve plant growth significantly (tree height in troughed mounds 120 % of that in untroughed mounds, 15 months after planting), but did not improve establishment.

40|$|Abstract Traditional salt {{farming in}} Goa, India has been practised {{for the past}} 1, 500 [*]years by a few communities. Goa’s {{riverine}} estuaries, easy access to sea water and favourable climatic conditions makes salt production attractive during summer. Salt produced through this natural evaporation process also {{played an important role}} in the economy of Goa even during the Portuguese rule as salt was the chief export commodity. In the past there were 36 villages involved in salt production, which is now reduced to 9. Low income, lack of skilled labour, competition from industrially produced salt, losses incurred on the yearly damage of embankments are the major reasons responsible for the reduction in the number of salt pans. Salt pans (Mithagar or Mithache agor) form a part of the reclaimed <b>waterlogged</b> khazan <b>lands,</b> which are also utilised for aquaculture, pisciculture and agriculture. Salt pans in Goa experience three phases namely, the ceased phase during monsoon period of June to October, preparatory phase from December to January, and salt harvesting phase, from February to June. After the monsoons, the salt pans are prepared manually for salt production. During high tide, an influx of sea water occurs, which enters the reservoir pans through sluice gates. The sea water after 1 – 2 [*]days on attaining a salinity of approximately 5 ºBé, is released into the evaporator pans and kept till it attains a salinity of 23 - 25 ºBé. The brine is then released to crystallizer pans, where the salt crystallises out 25 - 27 ºBé and is then harvested. Salt pans form a unique ecosystem where succession of different organisms with varying environmental conditions occurs. Organisms ranging from bacteria, archaea to fungi, algae, etc., are known to colonise salt pans and may influence the quality of salt produced. The aim of this review is to describe salt farming in Goa’s history, importance of salt production as a community activity, traditional method of salt production and the biota associated with salt pans. </p...|$|R
