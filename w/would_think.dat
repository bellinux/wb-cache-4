5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} {{not to have the}} March article come out—Everyone <b>would</b> <b>think</b> he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a glare of publicity and such a fire of criticism. I {{had nothing to do with}} the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
60|$|You <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> it {{when you}} saw her big {{carriage}} rattling up to the drawing-room, and {{caught a glimpse of}} her plumes, lappets, and diamonds, waving over her ladyship's sandy hair and majestical hooked nose;--you <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> {{it when you}} hear 'Lady Susan Scraper's carriage' bawled out at midnight so as to disturb all Belgravia:--you <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> it when she comes rustling into church, the obsequious John behind with the bag of Prayer-books. Is it possible, you would say, that so grand and awful a personage as that can be hard-up for money? Alas! So it is.|$|R

5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public <b>would</b> <b>think.</b> Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Hines {{went to the}} Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia, after his escape in January 1864. He {{convinced}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{of a plan to}} instill mass panic in the Northern states, by means of freeing prisoners and causing arson in larger Northern cities. Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed to the plan, and encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of Hines' actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help his confidence throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that he <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she <b>would</b> <b>think</b> she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Nomura {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the staff <b>would</b> <b>think</b> on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, Gramsci {{died before}} he could {{completely}} articulate how hegemony mediates the subordinate classes in periods of relative calm or how to work against {{the powers of the}} ruling classes as exerted in this way.

25|$|So Kock went {{directly}} to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised.

But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which contained not a single word about {{this or any other}} colonial plan.|$|E
