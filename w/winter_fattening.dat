After controlling for {{time of day}} and overall body size, annual variation in body weight was small and generally not statistically significant. However, analysis revealed evidence of significant "winter fattening," comparable in magnitude to other temperate-zone resident species, {{in three of the}} species. The degree of <b>winter</b> <b>fattening</b> did not correlate with either the size of the acorn crop (for the Acorn Woodpecker) or latitude, two variables potentially related to predictability of food resources. However, the smaller species exhibited significantly greater <b>winter</b> <b>fattening</b> than the larger species, as predicted by the hypothesis that energy storage should be more important for small-bodied species. Furthermore, the food-storing Acorn Woodpecker exhibited considerably less <b>winter</b> <b>fattening</b> than the nonfood-storing species, supporting the hypothesis that food storage provides an ecological alternative to <b>winter</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the winter body mass patterns of a northern, ground-feeding passerine, the Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis, which we attracted to artificial food sources {{in three different}} altitudinal habitat zones in north-east Scotland. Despite similar patterns of food availability in mid- and late-winter, Snow Buntings appeared to regulate their energy reserves by gaining body mass more quickly during the shorter days of mid-winter than during the longer days of late-winter. The increased rate of mass gain was more than sufficient to offset the longer periods of overnight fasting, so that dawn body mass peaked in mid-winter: the birds therefore showed true <b>winter</b> <b>fattening.</b> Birds also carried more reserves at higher altitudes. These seasonal and altitudinal trends suggest that Snow Buntings increase their reserves when the risk that food will become unavailable increases.

40|$|Published in {{association}} with Economics Section, School of Social Sciences, University of Waikato. This is the second report that investigates into tower silo farming in New Zealand. As stressed in the first report, there is insufficient evidence from the past operation of these farming methods in New Zealand to assess their economic profitability. Therefore, three budget situations are explored in detail: <b>winter</b> beef <b>fattening,</b> <b>wintering</b> store beef weaners, and town supply dairy; and the relative profitability {{of the system is}} assessed by this method. It appears that in most cases the initial investment in tower silos will bring about considerable changes in the whole management system. Thus, it is imperative to take into account all the quantifiable benefits and costs of any given tower silo system by looking at most items of the whole farm budget. For this reason, the approach used here has been to attempt to estimate the profitability of the whole farm investment including tower silos and associated buildings and plant. This farm net profit level with silos can be compared with that level expected for the same farm without silos, farmed by more conventional methods, and any difference in favour of the former can be imputed as a return on this incremental farm capital investment, which will be then available for comparison with rates obtainable in other alternative on-farm or off-farm investments...|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} small birds are {{resident}} in boreal forests where environmental temperatures can be − 20 to − 30 °C, or even lower, in winter. As winter days are short, and food is scarce, winter survival {{is a challenge}} for small endothermic animals. A bird of this size will have to gain almost 10 % of its lean body mass in fat every day to sustain overnight metabolism. Birds such as parids (titmice and chickadees) can use facultative hypothermia, {{a process in which}} body temperature is actively down-regulated to a specific level, to reduce heat loss and thus save energy. During cold winter nights, these birds may decrease body temperature from the normal from 42 ° down to 35 °C, or even lower in some species. However, birds are unable to move in this deep hypothermic state, making it a risky strategy if predators are around. Why, then, do small northern birds enter a potentially dangerous physiological state for a relatively small reduction in energy expenditure? We used stochastic dynamic programming to investigate this. Our model suggests that the use of nocturnal hypothermia at night is paramount in these biomes, as it would increase winter survival for a small northern bird by 58 % over a winter of 100 days. Our model also explains the phenomenon known as <b>winter</b> <b>fattening,</b> and its relationship to thermoregulation, in northern birds...|$|E

50|$|In Europe, {{the bright}} green shield bugs appear in May, having hibernated as imagos during the <b>winter.</b> They <b>fatten</b> {{for a month}} and then mate in June.

After the eggs hatch, the green shield bug enter a larval stage (which is really their first nymphal stage) where, in general, they remain together in sibling communities. This is made possible by the excretion of an aggregation pheromone. In case of danger, another pheromone is released which causes dispersal. The larval stage is followed by four more nymphal stages as well as moulting between each one. The green shield bug displays different colouration during each nymphal stage, light brown, black or green-black, and in the final stage, the imago, is bright green with short wings. Usually the imago stage is reached in September, with hibernation occurring in November.|$|R
40|$|Winter {{acclimatization}} {{in birds}} {{is a complex}} of several strategies based on metabolic adjustment accompanied by long-term management of resources such as fattening. However, wintering birds often maintain fat reserves below their physiological capacity, suggesting a cost involved with excessive levels of reserves. We studied body reserves of roosting great tits {{in relation to their}} dominance status under two contrasting temperature regimes to see whether individuals are capable of optimizing their survival strategies under extreme environmental conditions. We predicted less pronounced loss of body mass and body condition and lower rates of overnight mortality in dominant great tits at both mild and extremely low ambient temperatures, when ambient temperature dropped down to − 43 °C. The results showed that dominant great tits consistently maintained lower reserve levels than subordinates regardless of ambient temperature. However, dominants responded to the rising risk of starvation under low temperatures by increasing their body reserves, whereas subdominant birds decreased reserve levels in harsh conditions. Yet, their losses of body mass and body reserves were always lower than in subordinate birds. None of the dominant great tits were found dead, while five young females and one adult female were found dead in nest boxes during cold spells when ambient temperatures dropped down to − 43 °C. The dead great tits lost up to 23. 83 % of their evening body mass during cold nights while surviving individuals lost on average 12. 78 % of their evening body mass.

[URL] body mass models for small wintering birds are central to animal ecology, and offer insights into maximizing individual fitness in a complex environment. Such models assume both costs and benefits of fat deposition, and consider how they affect winter survival probability. Hypothesized mass-dependent costs of elevated fat include increased wing load and subsequent reduced ability to avoid predators, as well as increased predator exposure while feeding to fatten. A likely benefit of winter fat is increased fasting capacity during resource shortages. Here I test optimal body mass theory by searching for both cost and benefits of <b>winter</b> <b>fattening,</b> utilizing interspecific variation in winter fat in natural populations. If increased predation risk is a mass-dependent cost of fattening, wintering birds occupying dense (closed) winter habitat offering low exposure to predators should show (1) higher fat reserves, and (2) higher wing load, than wintering birds occupying less dense (open) habitat offering less protection from predators. This prediction was tested in the two winters in south-central Kansas, a north temperate region with winter precipitation falling as snow and low ambient winter temperatures. The predicted patterns in wing load and winter fat reserve were observed: with phylogeny controlled, both were significantly lower in two open cover species (Dark-eyed Junco Junco hyemalis, American Tree Sparrow Spizella arborea) than in eight closed cover species (seven sparrow species in the genera Melospiza, Passerella, and Zonotrichia, and the Spotted Towhee Pipilo maculatus). Body mass increased with wing area at a greater rate in the closed than in the open cover group, indicating lower body-size specific wing load in the latter group. With phylogeny controlled, fat level varied inversely with resource predictability among three winter foraging guilds occupying a vertical gradient of snowfall probability, indicating both costs and benefits exist in the study system.

The underlying assumption is that, regardless of the project, one must follow some semblance of order or little good will be derived. A study of this type is timely for three reasons: (1) the dryland wheat farmer is searching for a profitable use of his surplus labor during the winter months; (2) he already possesses many of the facilities required in cattle feeding; and (3) he has had little or no experience in this type of operation.

40|$|The long, cold winters and {{the summer}} {{rainfall}} of the New England region mean that, {{in the absence of}} conservation of surplus summer grass, wool-cutting properties tend to be overstocked in the winter and understocked in the summer. The closing up of relatively frost-resistant improved pasture in the autumn for later grazing in the winter does help, however, to level out that pasture production which is consumable on the hoof. Even so, the existence of improved pastures capable of rearing milk-fed, fat lambs has inclined many graziers towards running their properties, all or in part, under fat lamb rearing systems. As they see it, this simplifies management problems relating to stock numbers. The size of the ewe flock is solely determined by the number of ewes which it is considered a place can carry through the winter.

40|$|As {{ecosystems}} undergo changes worldwide, physiological {{flexibility is}} likely to be an important adaptive response to increased climate instability. Extreme weather fluctuations impose energetical constraints such as unpredictable food shortage. We tested how grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) could adjust their daily heterothermy and locomotor activity to these 'energetic accidents' with a food restriction experiment. The experimental design consisted of acute calorie restriction (2 weeks, 80 % restriction) in the middle of <b>winter,</b> after a <b>fattening</b> season with low (11 weeks, 40 % restriction) versus high (ad libitum) food availability. This design aimed at simulating the combined effects {{of the quality of the}} fattening season (acclimation effect) and a sudden, severe food shortage during the lean season. Hour of start and duration of torpor were the most flexible components of energy savings, increasing in response to the acute food shortage with facilitation by chronic restriction (acclimation effect). Modulations of locomotor activity did not support the hypothesis of energy savings, as total locomotor activity was not reduced. Nonetheless, acutely restricted individuals modified their temporal pattern of locomotor activity according to former food availability. We provide the first experimental evidence of different temporal levels of flexibility of energy-saving mechanisms in a heterotherm exposed to food shortage. The acclimation effect of past food scarcity suggests that heterothermic organisms are better able to respond to unpredicted food scarcity during the lean season. The flexible control of energy expenditure conferred by heterothermy may facilitate the plastic response of heterothermic species to more frequent climatic hazards...|$|R
40|$|Nursing sickness, {{the largest}} single cause of {{mortality}} in adult female mink (Mustela vison), {{is an example of}} a metabolic disorder, which develops when the demands for lactation require extensive mobilization of body energy reserves. The condition is characterized by progressive weight loss, emaciation, and dehydration with high concentrations of glucose and insulin in the blood. Morbidity due to nursing sickness can be as high as 15 % with mortality around 8 %, but the incidence is known to vary from year to year. Stress has been shown to trigger the onset of the disease and old females and females with large litters are most often affected. Increasing demand for gluconeogenesis from amino acids due to heavy milk production may be a predisposing factor. Glucose metabolism is inextricably linked to that of protein and fats. In obesity (or lipodystrophy), the ability of adipose tissue to buffer the daily influx of nutrients is overwhelmed (or absent), interfering with insulin-mediated glucose disposal and leading to insulin resistance. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 3 family play an important role in modulating insulin signalling and glucose uptake by peripheral tissue. The increasing demand on these fatty acids for milk fat synthesis towards late lactation may result in deficiency in the lactating female, thus impairing glucose disposal. It is suggested that the underlying cause of mink nursing sickness is the development of acquired insulin resistance with 3 contributing key elements: obesity (or lipodystrophy), n- 3 fatty acid deficiency, and high protein oxidation rate. It is recommended that mink breeder females be kept in moderate body condition during fall and <b>winter</b> to avoid <b>fattening</b> or emaciation. A dietary n- 3 fatty acid supplement during the lactation period may be beneficial for improved glycemic control. Lowering of dietary protein reduces (oxidative) stress and improves water balance in the nursing females and may, therefore, prevent the development and help in the management of nursing sickness. It is also surmised that other, thus far unexplained, metabolic disorders seen in male and female mink may be related to acquired insulin resistance...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by the British Ornithologists’ Union, the Linnean Society, the A. P. Leventis Foundation and Chris Goodwin. Afro-Palaearctic migrants are declining to a greater degree than other European species, suggesting that processes occurring in Africa or on migration may be driving these trends. Constraints in food availability on the wintering grounds may contribute to the declines but little is known about when and where these resource constraints may occur. Sufficient resources are particularly important prior to spring migration, when migrants must cross the Sahara desert. We examined mass gain and departure phenology in a long-distance Palaearctic passerine migrant to determine the degree to which pre-migratory fattening occurs in their long-term non-breeding territories in the Guinea Savannah region of Africa. We monitored 75 Whinchats Saxicola rubetra for departure from their non-breeding territories in one spring, and analysed mass data of 377 Whinchats collected over three non-breeding seasons plus 141 migrating Whinchats caught in April over eight years, all within the same few square kilometres of anthropogenically-modified Guinea Savannah in central Nigeria. Whinchats left their winter territories throughout April, with males departing on average eight days earlier than females. However, {{there was no evidence that}} time of departure from territory was linked to age, body size or mass at capture. Whinchats departed their territories with a predicted mass of 16. 8 ± 0. 3 g, which is much less than the ~ 24 g required for the average Whinchat to cross the Sahara directly. Comparing departure dates with arrival dates in southern Europe shows a discrepancy of at least two weeks, suggesting that many Whinchats spend considerable time on pre-migratory fuelling outside of their territory prior to crossing the Sahara. Over-wintering birds gained mass slowly during February and March (0. 03 gd- 1 34), and non-territorial or migrating birds at a much higher rate in April (at least 0. 23 gd- 1 35), with up to 20 % of migrating Whinchats in April potentially having sufficient fuel loads to cross the Sahara directly from central Nigeria. Our results suggest that most Whinchats leave their <b>winter</b> territories to <b>fatten</b> up locally or, possibly, by staging further north. Resource constraints are therefore likely to be particularly focussed in West Africa during mid-April and possibly at staging areas before the crossing of the Sahara desert.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 801 on 08. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) This programme of research examines {{the ecology of}} the threatened perennial Lobelia urens L. (the heath lobelia) which reaches the northern limit of its distribution in the southern coastal counties of England. A survey of the historical evidence of the distribution of the species in England is presented. Restricted to such a small area, L. urens has always been rare in Britain. The six remaining populations were surveyed to describe the phytosociology of communities containing L. urens and the variability of the environmental factors controlling its distribution. L. urens is shown {{to be a member of}} rough grass-heath communities dominated by Molinia caerulea and situated on seasonally waterlogged, moderately acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Studies of the demography of L. urens focused on two extant populations. Experimental research was carried out to support these demographic studies both in the field, on plants grown in a common garden, and under the controlled conditions of the glasshouse and laboratory. This information on the ecology of L. urens was used to construct stage-structured population matrices. Recruitment success in L. urens is shown to be very low in Britain and results suggest that this controls the density of British populations. The availability of seed does not regulate the rate of germination. Instead, recruitment of L. urens at the northern edge of its range is restricted by its specific habitat requirements, along with low summer temperatures and the short growing season. Establishment from seed is facilitated by micro-habitats that provide high light intensities and, more importantly, protection against soil moisture loss. Whilst winter disturbance by herbivores is shown to be essential for successful recruitment, adult growth and survival is better in ungrazed communities. However, even the small plants of the grazed areas are very fecund. The seed forms a large persistent bank that embodies a reserve of individuals and genetic variability which offers protection against extinction. The thesis concludes that the soil moisture status and disturbance regimes at Redlake and Andrew's Wood are limiting the growth rates of the L. urens populations. In order to maintain populations, the redirection of drainage water is prescribed to increase the soil moisture status. L. urens is suited to intermittent soil disturbance, the timing and intensity of which was shown to be important, whilst the duration between grazes was seen to be less critical. Results suggest that the habitat created by occasional heavy <b>winter</b> grazing of <b>fattening</b> cattle would be very favourable to L. urens...|$|R
40|$|R. temporaria and R. arvalis are {{widespread}} species, {{and their}} sympatry zone extends for some 4000 kilometers from {{west to east}} and in the widest part along meridian 33 º east longitude about 2000 kilometers. The distinction in the physiology of hibernation {{and the nature of}} their winter shelters between R. temporaria and R. arvalis is principial. The common frog, as a kind of a potential water-hibernator, can remain in the terrestrial shelters where a local climate permits. Moor frog which is capable to cope with body freezing is a potential land hibernator, but certain situations make it spend winter under water. Both species can use bogs as wintering shelters. Strategy of R. temporaria spawning was formed in the conditions of small river basins not exposed to vast floods, with the accompanying streams-tributaries, inlets, flow-through lakes, oxbows, potholes, etc. Breeding behavior of frogs consists in forming a «mat» or «cushion» of the spawn clumps, which prevent their drifting towards deep water. In contrast, the «core» breeding habitat of R. arvalis is flat lowland areas with a non-static level of shallow water. Scattered oviposition of this frog significantly increases the chances of larvae to complete their development in isolated pools and ponds remaining after drying shallow water areas. The congestion of clutches can occur only at a high density of breeding specimens of the moor frog in some circumstances. In fact, this is only a reduction to the minimum the distance between males, but not a desire of animals to aggregate. In favorable conditions and living side by side, R. temporaria and R. arvalis have always some extent overlap of spawning habitats, and they can spawn close to each other. Common frog is a mobile and terrestrial species. Therefore it occupies the wide range of summer foraging habitats in the area having a certain landscape. Usually, this is a variety of forest habitats, scrubs and nearby meadow areas, rocky tundra, and marshy runoff beds covered with shrubbery or uneven scrub mires. Summer habitats of R. arvalis are primarily open or semi-open landscape faces, often soggy. In European mountains, R. temporaria is known to occur up to 2750 m above sea level, and in the south it does not come down to the lowlands. R. arvalis usually avoids areas located above 500 – 600 m, and they are rarely found at the height exceeding 900 m a. s. l. However, in the mountains of Southern Siberia populations of this species are common at altitudes up to 1800 m a. s. l., and the documented upper limit is 2400 m a. s. l. The causes of such differences in vertical distribution of the species are fundamental differences in the geomorphological properties of the landscape of mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. All european mountains (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Scandinavia and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula), including the Urals, are mostly folded structures that arose in the process of deformation (folds and thrust faults) of the Earth crust in its horizontal motions. A less important role play blocky and arched uplifts, which are expressed only in the relief of midlands and lowlands of Central Europe (Slate Mountains, Schwarzwald, Bohemian Massif, etc.), stretching between the Central European plain and the systems of the Alps and Western Carpathians. Mountain systems are linearly elongated, dissected by weakly developed river valleys, which are narrow and steep-sided. These mountains do not have any large horizontal troughs, and the width of sloping valleys is less than a few kilometers everywhere. The bottoms of the valleys are seldom flat over large areas. Midlands and lowlands have the character of erosion dissected plateaus with narrow canyons. In contrast to the mountain areas in Europe, in Siberia {{we have to deal with}} the compound such as single mountain zone countries (Altai, Sayany, Baikal, Aldan). In the formation of the belt which stretches almost 3. 500 kilometers arched and arched-block lifting plays the main role. In this case, the vast areas of the Earth crust experienced bending, followed by block division. Raised relict surfaces of alignment occupy areas on the flat hilly plains, uplands and tablelands, and form the bottom of the intermountain basins. Numerous valleys and hollows of South Siberian mountain belt sometimes so extensive, that separated highlands, ridges, river valleys with alluvium exist within them. Populations of R. temporaria in the European mountains are confined to the wooded valleys with rivers and streams running through them, to the shores of lakes in all altitudinal belts. In such circumstances, R. arvalis is deprived of its «core» landscape — flat marshy areas with stagnant water that impedes the penetration of this species to a mountainous terrain. In the mountains of Southern Siberia, uplifted hilly plains and plateaus are abundantly watered due to climatic conditions and water-physical properties of crumbly sediments. They are favorable for wide distribution of diverse bogs. Viable populations of R. arvalis inhabit all the altitudinal belts of mountain areas in Siberia where there are spacious and level surfaces: from waterlogged floodplains (Vitim river) to alpine tundra (Altai Mts.) The distribution of R. temporaria, the European species, everywhere in the area is associated with the landscapes, which are characterized by a pronounced micro- or mesorelief. The presence of small permanent and temporary streams and lakes with renewed water is necessary. Various small ponds usually present as well. General features of the relief does not permit significant overflows and floods of rivers and lake-river systems (areas affected by extensive flooding are avoided by the species categorically). Small marshes of eutrophic-mesotrophic series and the areas of wetlands are often present (in vast marshy terrains this frog does not occur). Spawning takes place in different riparian ponds, as well as in closed, relatively deep, temporary and permanent water bodies with similar hydrological regime, sometimes at a large distance from their hibernation sites. Obvious «outposts» of R. temporaria distribution are mountains. Of geographic range for some 15 thousand kilometers, if it is outlined on the extreme points of findings this species on the mainland, one half falls on the mountain massifs. As for the habitats of R. arvalis, the Europaean and Siberian species, a fundamentally different morphology of the landscape is inherent. This is a kind of flat and concave mesoforms and hydromorphic areas of the smooth relief with stagnant ponds. In any terrain, species demonstrates stronger preference for marshy landscape tracts, flooded areas of river valleys, reed quaking bogs, raw moorlands, and other wetlands. In different geographical conditions, such tract may be narrowed to the rim along the shores of lakes and rivers drying up in the steppe zone and in coastal meadows in northern Europe, or it dominates in the landscape either in Western Siberia or on the flat tundra in the North. In the landscape tracts inhabited by this species, tree or shrub vegetation rarely presents. The appearance of moor frogs in some «dry» forested habitats is probably caused by the presence of marshy areas nearby. <b>Wintering,</b> spawning and <b>fattening</b> of R. arvalis often occur in the same biotope and the year around. It is only where there is the interpenetration of «core» landscapes of each species (large areas of the northern and western parts of the East European Plain, and a part of the West Siberian Plain contiguous to the Urals), one can observe the examples of real sympatry of R. arvalis and R. temporaria...|$|R
