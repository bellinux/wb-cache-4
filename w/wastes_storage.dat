40|$|This {{document}} contains Technical Safety Requirements (TSR) for the Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Management (RHWM) <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES, {{which include}} Area 612 (A 612) and the Decontamination and Waste Treatment Facility (DWTF) Storage Area at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The TSRs constitute requirements regarding the safe {{operation of the}} <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES. These TSRs are derived from the Documented Safety Analysis for the <b>Waste</b> <b>Storage</b> Facilities (DSA) (LLNL 2006). The analysis presented therein determined that the <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES are low-chemical hazard, Hazard Category 2 non-reactor nuclear facilities. The TSRs consist primarily of inventory limits and controls to preserve the underlying assumptions in the hazard and accident analyses. Further, appropriate commitments to safety programs are presented in the administrative controls sections of the TSRs. The <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES are used by RHWM to handle and store hazardous waste, TRANSURANIC (TRU) WASTE, LOW-LEVEL WASTE (LLW), mixed waste, California combined waste, nonhazardous industrial waste, and conditionally accepted waste generated at LLNL as well as small amounts from other U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, {{as described in the}} DSA. In addition, several minor treatments (e. g., drum crushing, size reduction, and decontamination) are carried out in these facilities. The <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES are located in two portions of the LLNL main site. A 612 is located in the southeast quadrant of LLNL. The A 612 fenceline is approximately 220 m west of Greenville Road. The DWTF Storage Area, which includes Building 693 (B 693), Building 696 Radioactive <b>Waste</b> <b>Storage</b> Area (B 696 R), and associated yard areas and storage areas within the yard, is located in the northeast quadrant of LLNL in the DWTF complex. The DWTF Storage Area fenceline is approximately 90 m west of Greenville Road. A 612 and the DWTF Storage Area are subdivided into various facilities and storage areas, consisting of buildings, tents, other structures, and open areas as described in Chapter 2 of the DSA. Section 2. 4 of the DSA provides an overview of the buildings, structures, and areas in the <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES, including construction details such as basic floor plans, equipment layout, construction materials, controlling dimensions, and dimensions significant to the hazard and accident analysis. Chapter 5 of the DSA documents the derivation of the TSRs and develops the operational limits that protect the safety envelope defined for the <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES. This TSR document is applicable to the handling, storage, and treatment of hazardous waste, TRU WASTE, LLW, mixed waste, California combined waste, nonhazardous industrial waste, and conditionally accepted waste received or generated in the <b>WASTE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> FACILITIES.

Most of human population use wells or springs as the main source of drinking water. Wells are generally less than 20 meters deep and they are not properly sealed. Well waters investigated in January 2004 have a very large range of trace constituent and chemical composition in the zone of interest. Manganese concentrations range is 8 µg/L – 1115 µg/L and concentrations of barium vary in the range of 55 µg/L – 4967 µg/L. 67 % of monitored well waters are of manganese concentration higher than 50 µg/L and 44 % contain barium with a concentration higher than 700 µg/L. Total dissolved solids vary between 8 mg/L and 881 mg/L and well water pHs are acidic (4. 28 – 5. 94). Nitrate concentrations monitored in Mahitsy groundwaters show that, 54 % of the well water samples exceed 50 mg/L (WHO guidelines value) and 84 % exceed 13. 5 mg/L (indicative value of human activities). The nitrate content ranges from 4 to 489 mg/L. Groundwater nitrate correlates positively with chloride and potassium.

The maintenance of soil health is essential for sustained productivity of food, the decomposition of <b>wastes,</b> <b>storage</b> of heat, sequestration of carbon, and the exchange of gases. However, only a limited area of the soil can actually be used for growing food, and when improperly managed it can be eroded, polluted or even destroyed (Brady and Weil 2000). It is estimated that the soil in 11 % of the vegetative area and 38 % of the cultivated area in the world have been degraded since 1945 (Hammond 1992, Gardiner and Miller 2004). This is an area of the size of China and India together. Approximately 24 billion tons of topsoil is lost annually, which is equivalent to about 9. 6 million hectares of land (Bakker 1990). Therefore, soil degradation and/ or changes in soil quality that result from wind and water erosion, salinization, losses of organic matter and nutrients, or soil compaction are of great concern in every agricultural region in the world. In the last two decades, public interest in soil quality has been increasing throughout the world as humankind recognizes the fragility of earth’s soil, water and air resources, and the need of their protection to sustain civilization. The concept of soil quality was first suggested in 1977 at a confer-ence (Doran and Parkin 1994) which focused on Effects of agricultural management on soil organic matter and carbon transformation – a revie...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} finding {{mathematical}} tools to represent rigid body motions in space {{has long been}} {{on the agenda of}} physicists and mathematicians and {{is considered to be a}} well-researched and well-understood problem. Robotics, computer vision, graphics, and other engineering disciplines require concise and efficient means of representing and applying generalized coordinate transformations in three dimensions. Robotics requires systematic ways to represent the relative position or orientation of a manipulator rigid links and objects. However, with the advent of high-speed computers and their application to the generation of animated graphical images and control of robot manipulators, new interest arose in identifying compact and computationally efficient representations of spatial transformations. The traditional methods for representing forward kinematics of manipulators have been the homogeneous matrix in line with the D-H algorithm. In robotics, this matrix is used to describe one coordinate system with respect to another one. However for online operation and manipulation of the robotic manipulator in a flexible manner the computational time plays an important role. Although this method is used extensively in kinematic analysis but it is relatively neglected in practical robotic systems due to some complications in dealing with the problem of orientation representation. On the other hand, such matrices are highly redundant to represent six independent degrees of freedom. This redundancy can introduce numerical problems in calculations, <b>wastes</b> <b>storage,</b> and often increases the computational cost of algorithms. Keeping these drawbacks in mind, alternative methods are being sought by various researchers for representing the same and reducing the computational time to make the system fast responsive in a flexible environment. Researchers in robot kinematics tried alternative methods in order to represent rigid body transformations based on concepts introduced by mathematicians and physicists such as Euler angle or Epsilon algebra. In the present work alternative representations, using quaternion algebra and lie algebra are proposed, tried and compared...|$|E
40|$|Solids such as {{granular}} activated carbon, hematite {{and sodium}} phosphates, if present as sludge components in nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> tanks, {{have been found}} to be capable of precipitating/sorbing actinides like plutonium, neptunium and uranium from nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> tank supernatant liqueur. Thus, the potential may exists for the accumulation of fissile materials in such nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> tanks during lengthy nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> and processing. To evaluate the nuclear criticality safety in a typical nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> tank, a study was initiated to measure the affinity of granular activated carbon, hematite and anhydrous sodium phosphate to sorb plutonium, neptunium and uranium from alkaline salt solutions. Tests with simulated and actual nuclear waste solutions established the affinity of the solids for plutonium, neptunium and uranium upon contact of the solutions with each of the solids. The removal of plutonium and neptunium from the synthetic salt solution by nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>storage</b> tank solids may be due largely to the presence of the granular activated carbon and transition metal oxides in these storage tank solids or sludge. Granular activated carbon and hematite also showed measurable affinity for both plutonium and neptunium.

40|$|Geoscientific {{models and}} {{measurements}} generate false precision (scientifically meaningless data bits) that <b>wastes</b> <b>storage</b> space. False precision can mislead (by implying noise is signal) and be scientifically pointless, especially for measurements. By contrast, lossy compression {{can be both}} economical (save space) and heuristic (clarify data limitations) without compromising the scientific integrity of data. Data quantization can thus be appropriate regardless of whether space limitations are a concern. We introduce, implement, and characterize a new lossy compression scheme suitable for IEEE floating-point data. Our new Bit Grooming algorithm alternately shaves (to zero) and sets (to one) the least significant bits of consecutive values to preserve a desired precision. This is a symmetric, two-sided variant of an algorithm sometimes called Bit Shaving that quantizes values solely by zeroing bits. Our variation eliminates the artificial low bias produced by always zeroing bits, and makes Bit Grooming more suitable for arrays and multi-dimensional fields whose mean statistics are important. Bit Grooming relies on standard lossless compression to achieve the actual reduction in storage space, so we tested Bit Grooming by applying the DEFLATE compression algorithm to bit-groomed and full-precision climate data stored in netCDF 3, netCDF 4, HDF 4, and HDF 5 formats. Bit Grooming reduces the storage space required by initially uncompressed and compressed climate data by 25 – 80 and 5 – 65  %, respectively, for single-precision values (the most common case for climate data) quantized to retain 1 – 5  decimal digits of precision. The potential reduction is greater for double-precision datasets. When used aggressively (i. e., preserving only 1 – 2  digits), Bit Grooming produces storage reductions comparable to other quantization techniques such as Linear Packing. Unlike Linear Packing, whose guaranteed precision rapidly degrades within the relatively narrow dynamic range of values that it can compress, Bit Grooming guarantees the specified precision throughout the full floating-point range. Data quantization by Bit Grooming is irreversible (i. e., lossy) yet transparent, meaning that no extra processing is required by data users/readers. Hence Bit Grooming can easily reduce data storage volume without sacrificing scientific precision or imposing extra burdens on users...|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{development}} and distribution in underground rocks have strong influence on rock properties, understanding the fracture system {{is critical to}} the oil and gas reservoir detection and production, groundwater resource, underground <b>wastes</b> <b>storage,</b> mining, seismology and CO 2 capture and storage. Due to the complex fracture distribution and geometry in nature rocks, the lack of information about fracture parameters (fracture density, length and thickness) makes the nature rock cannot be used in laboratory experiments. Rock physics experiments require the controlled and known fracture parameters and orientation in rock samples, thus synthetic samples were used to represent fractured rocks in several previous studies. However, the fractures were represented by other week material, such as silica rubber imbedded in epoxy solid, to simulate the fractured rocks in previous studies. The materials used to construct the samples (Lucite, silica rubber, sand bonded by epoxy) were very different from nature rocks, the solid representing background matrix and the week material representing fractures have no porous and fracture space and saturated fluids. In this study, we use new construction method based on material science progress to build synthetic samples which have similar mineral component, porous structure, cementation as nature rocks. The synthetic rock containing controlled fracture geometry provides a different way to create fractured rocks to observe the seismic anisotropy influenced by fracture parameters and fluids. The synthetic rocks are tested under high pressure to observe the pressure sensitivity, and SEM is used to observe the porous structure and fractures distrubution. We build a set of synthetic rocks to observe the effect of fractures upon seismic wave velocity and anisotropy. The samples are measured with 0. 5 MHz transducers. P and S wave velocity in different propagation directions of these four samples are measured when saturated by air and water. The experimental results can help in investigating the relationship between fracture density and P and S wave anisotropy in fractured reservoirs. The measurement results show that the P wave velocity and anisotropy is significantly influenced by saturating fluid. Shear wave velocity, shear wave splitting and shear wave anisotropy are less sensitive to saturating fluid but significantly affected by fracture density. P wave velocities in perpendicular direction show significant influences of fracture, the velocity decreases as the fracture density increases. Shear wave velocity in perpendicular direction decreases with the increasing fracture density, the difference between fast shear wave and slow shear wave velocity is smaller in this direction. However the slow shear wave velocity is more sensitive to fracture density than fast shear wave velocity in parallel direction, thus the difference of fast and slow shear wave velocity in parallel direction increases as the fracture density increases. P wave velocity is more sensitive to saturating fluids, as the velocity is higher in water saturation than air saturation. P wave anisotropy is much higher in air saturation, but decreases while saturated by water. Shear wave velocity and anisotropy is less sensitive to fluid saturation, but is more sensitive to fracture density since shear wave anisotropy increases significantly with increasing fracture density. The new construction process can provide more realistic rocks for rock physics experiments, in which the fracture parameters can be controlled. The measurement results show that P wave velocity and anisotropy is very sensitive to fluid saturation, P wave anisotropy decreases while rock is saturated by fluid with higher modulus. Shear wave velocity is not sensitive to fluids but is significantly influenced by fracture density...|$|E
