Some question as to her final disposition lies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> error in Lloyd's Register. Either she was sold for scrap in 1946 or ended up as a Panamanian-flagged Japanese whaler which was used until 1979.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2005, when Basciano {{was indicted}} for the Pizzolo murder, Massino was {{identified}} by news sources as the then-anonymous fellow mobster who secretly recorded his confession, to the public disgust of Massino's family. Further confirmation of Massino's defection came in February as he was identified as the source for the graveyard, then in May when the Justice Department dropped {{the threat of the}} death penalty regarding the Sciascia case. In a hearing on June 23, 2005, Massino finalized his deal and plead guilty to ordering the Sciascia murder. For this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> reduction depending on his service as a witness. That same day Josephine Massino negotiated a settlement to satisfy the forfeiture claim, keeping the homes of herself and Massino's mother as well as some rental properties while turning over, among other assets, a cache of $7 million and hundreds of gold bars, and the Casablanca restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Historian Alfred Price {{credited}} McKellar with 17 air victories, three shared destroyed, five {{probably destroyed}} and three damaged. Historians Christopher Shores and Clive Williams credit him with 21 air victories, three probably destroyed and three damaged as does E.C.R Baker. In his last combat they credit him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> 22nd victory, since a Bf 109 crashed {{in the area}} of his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim. John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 that crashed on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory. Chaz Bowyer, another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories.|$|E
5|$|Historical eclipses {{are a very}} {{valuable}} resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E

5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> five-year extension depending {{on a given}} project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to the incursion was gradual. Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force {{off the coast of}} the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of Vinh. Hanoi's preoccupation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the 304th, 308th and 320th. The 2nd Division had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.|$|E
5|$|The Xukpi Stone is a dedicatory {{monument}} {{from one}} of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. It bears the date of AD437 and the names both K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> mention of the Teotihuacan general Siyaj K'ak'. The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual. Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step and the date on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K'inich' Yax K'uk' Mo', which was discovered underneath the same structure.|$|E

Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance premiums and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15million and annual revenues not to exceed $15million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10million, and will guarantee only up to 10years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> 5-year extension.|$|E

Three cities submitted bids to host the event: Albena, Tallinn and Baku.|$|E
5|$|The helmet {{was found}} {{along with some}} 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest {{assemblage}} of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had been buried at what {{appears to have been}} a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> processional way leading up to it.
