2500|$|After {{establishing}} the Rankin School of Flying in Van Nuys, CA in 1939, a year later, Rankin {{was awarded a}} Department of Defense contract with the Army Air Corps to operate a civilian primary flying school for soon-to-be cadets. Now with the certification and contracts for his school, Rankin set about finding the school's ideal location. After extensive examination of <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> conditions, among other factors, Rankin found that the small agricultural town of Tulare, located {{in the heart of}} California's San Joaquin Valley was the perfect spot for his flying school. Years worth of weather condition statistics, reflected that the San Joaquin Valley had the best flying conditions weather-wise in the U.S. Tulare's site itself also proved ideal as it was located 12 miles east of normal airways and 6 miles from the heart of town, and initially was a large tract of farm land, which held no undesirable obstructions on it. The school was located eight miles southeast of Tulare, California. [...] At the beginning of the new year in 1941, Rankin flew throughout the U.S., recruiting and hiring flight instructors. With his team assembled, the Rankin Aeronautical Academy received their first civilian cadets began training in March 1941. The academy trained over 10, 450 cadets throughout its operation. Rankin graduates included twelve World War II aces, as well as two Medal of Honor winners, Frank Furey and the Ace of Aces, Richard Bong.|$|E

Since Cartwright had hoped for a mild November, this was unlucky. As a rule, cargo is plentiful at Montreal shortly before the St. Lawrence freezes and the last steamers to go down the river do so with heavy loads. Cartwright's plan was to run a boat across at the last moment and pick up goods the liners would not engage to carry, and he had sent Oreana because she was fast. When the drift ice began to gather, speed was useful.|$|E

40|$|Major {{problems}} of PDBS (Pictorial DataBase System) lie {{not only in}} its storage structure but also in its retrieving mechanism to search out a required picture easily. Most of PDBS 2 ̆ 7 s which have been developed {{are based on the}} frameworks of DBMS (DataBase Management System) which deals with symbolical data. However, such frameworks cannot be applied to some kinds of associative retrieval, for example, retrieval of similar pictures to the input one. In this paper, we present the retrieval of <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> based on the semantic similarity of the pictures. We define the similarity between two <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> as probability that they are similar. On the basis of the semantic structure, the similarity can be inferred from lower-leveled similarities of constituents of <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> In order to calculate the above probability inference, we adopt Dempster & Shafer 2 ̆ 7 s model of probability. This paper fully shows the methodology of semantic similarity retrieval of <b>weather</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R

50|$|Weather is {{determined}} {{at the start}} of the initiative winner's impulse using the <b>Weather</b> <b>Chart,</b> which is a function of the time of year and a die roll. The map is divided into 6 different weather zones and each zone is assigned its own weather based on the <b>Weather</b> <b>Chart</b> result. The weather influences combat modifiers, naval ability to spot enemy fleets, supply range, aircraft mission eligibility, land unit movement allowance and how fast the end of turn impulse marker advances after each impulse. Weather greatly influences turn length and what can be accomplished in terms of offensives.|$|E

50|$|Aerography is the {{production}} of <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> The information is supplied by radiosonde observations, principally. Constant-pressure charts are routinely constructed at standard air pressures. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 millibars (hectopascals) (hPa) (SI). <b>Weather</b> <b>charts</b> are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12 km). The lines of equal air pressure are called isobars. Isotherms are the lines of equal air temperature.|$|R

50|$|Unlike fronts, {{there is}} not a {{universal}} symbol for a trough on a <b>weather</b> <b>chart.</b> The weather charts in some countries or regions mark troughs by a line. In the United States, a trough may be marked as a dashed line. In the UK, Hong Kong and Fiji, it is represented by a bold line extended from a low pressure center or between two low pressure centers; in Macau and Australia, it is a dashed line. If they are not marked, troughs may still be identified as an extension of isobars away from a low pressure center.|$|E

50|$|Since Plumas is at a {{relatively}} higher elevation than Portage la Prairie or Gladstone, it usually sees frost and below zero temperatures {{before the rest of}} Southern Manitoba, in early to mid-autumn. Noting the proximity of Plumas to Lake Manitoba, intense weather systems are more likely to develop in this region, producing greater amounts of precipitation than in other locales further away from the lake, particularly during storms. Although Plumas is further away from Dauphin than Portage la Prairie, the community experiences more similar weather patterns to that of Dauphin.

50|$|Early in 1874 Edwin {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the newly instituted weather-reporting and storm-signalling section of the Marine department. Edwin, who had studied meteorology in the Royal Navy, was undoubtedly strongly influenced by the tradition of practical weather science of which Admiral Robert FitzRoy and the American, Matthew Fontaine Maury, were the most distinguished contemporary exponents. Spurred by the need for timely weather information that would enhance maritime safety, FitzRoy had begun daily forecasts from his Board of Trade office in London in 1860. By this date the forecasting of general weather patterns had become practicable. The use of reliable barometers enabled the accurate measurement of variations in air pressure - the fundamental principle {{in the assessment of}} weather changes. These measurements were taken simultaneously at widely separated stations, and by means of the electric telegraph were rapidly transmitted to a central office. There FitzRoy's synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> allowed the observations to be collated in a coherent visual form from which forecasts could be made.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} of Kuti valley {{in terms of}} research work on various branches of science inspired the council to conduct the second scientific expedition in the region.

Zoological collections were {{not up to the}} mark as anticipated earlier. Zoologists Probal Dey and Kamal Banerjee collected some reptiles including a poisonous snake, butterflies, parasites etc. Botanist Dr. Gour Maiti collected about two hundred plat species. Anthropology data were collected emphasizing on marriage system, Philology and physical studies. Anthropologist Mukul Hazra found that consanguineous marriage was common in this region earlier. Dr. Tridib Kumar Bose, a geographer, recorded complete <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> from Pithoragarh to Kuti. Some plants used by local people for medicinal purpose were collected too. Mukhopadhyay organised the expedition and handled the administrative side of it.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly, {{the output}} {{data from a}} {{computer}} simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation parameters. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in mathematical models. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by computer-generated-imagery (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> {{they might be able}} to predict events (and [...] "see that rain was headed their way") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud coordinates. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, weather forecasting models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.|$|E
