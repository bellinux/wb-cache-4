Small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning nose rings or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves' attempts to suckle. Many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner auction sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of Australia. Victoria and New South Wales have yardings of up to 8,000 <b>weaners</b> (calves) for auction sale in one day. The best of these <b>weaners</b> may go to the butchers.

50|$|Presumably, A. suum {{infections are}} present in pig farms all over the world. However, few {{countries}} have up-to-date information on its prevalence. In a Swedish study {{it appeared that the}} pens of sows and fatteners are the heaviest infected environments. This was shown by the presence of eggs in old faecal deposits collected from the pens. These findings were supported by studies from China and Denmark where the highest prevalence of A. suum was also found in breeding sows and fatteners. The prevalence in breeding boars is usually lower than in sows or fatteners. Nevertheless, infected boars could also be an important source of transmission of parasite eggs on the farm since they are often located in more traditional pens than the sows (e.g. with solid floor and/or bedding). Moreover, boars are regularly used for contact stimulation of the sows, which allows them to spread the infection by defecating in areas other than their own pen.Strong evidence exists that under indoor conditions, massive infection of piglets with A. suum usually occurs shortly after arrival in the highly infectious fattening units and not in the farrowing pens. Several studies have shown that A. suum egg excretion was nearly absent in <b>weaners</b> despite the, sometimes substantial, presence of eggs in the farrowing pens of intensive herds. Here, the increased hygienic standards in combination with the low humidity in the farrowing pens may significantly reduce the presence of favourable microenvironments for egg survival. On the other hand, in piglets raised under outdoor conditions, significant transmission is thought to occur soon after birth and pigs are infected before fattening.|$|E
50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm infection pressure on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the herd. Farmers with fattening herds are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether <b>weaners</b> need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of rough and uneven surfaces would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the fattening pens when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum eggs. Instead, steam cleaning and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|E

Repeated spatial cluster analyses were performed to identify persistent clusters, i. e. areas included in a significant cluster throughout all four time periods. Antimicrobials prescribed for <b>weaners</b> did not result in any persistent clusters.

A dynamic programming approach was used to determine optimal feeding strategies for different starting conditions. Lupin seed was preferred to oats for <b>weaners</b> when paddock feed was abundant, while oats was preferred for <b>weaners</b> and adults when paddock feed was scarce. The optimal feeding rate usually starts low and then gradually increases to higher rates as the autumn break approaches. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|The large {{heterogeneity}} among porcine reproductive {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates {{is probably the}} main obstacle to its effective control using current commercial vaccines. Intentionally exposing all breeding pigs to PRRSV circulating on the farm could eliminate porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) from the herd. The objective {{of this study was}} to eliminate PRRS from a farrow-to-finish pig farm by serum inoculation. The owner was acquainted with the strict biosecurity measures. Breeding pigs were immunised with serum, which was obtained from PRRSV-positive <b>weaners</b> from the same farm. The percent of antibody high positive breeding pigs decreased six months after serum inoculation, while 34 months after serum inoculation no more antibody high positive pigs were detected and 56. 8 % of breeding pigs and all other categories were free of antibodies. In the breeding herd no virus was detected during all testing while PRRSV circulated in 2 -month-old <b>weaners</b> until 12 months after serum inoculation. Later all tested samples from <b>weaners,</b> growers and fatteners were negative. Herd closure and the adoption of strict biosecurity measures are essential. Serum inoculation of the breeding herd proved to be a successful measure for eliminating PRRS from this farrow-to-finish farm...|$|E
40|$|Porcine {{necrotic}} ear syndrome (PNES) in pigs {{has been}} reported as an increasing health problem in many countries with intensive pig farming. The etiology of this disease is complex and the presumed triggering factors {{can be divided into}} infectious and non-infectious agents. The present report describes a case of Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV 2), infection associated with lesions of PNES at the weaning stage of a farrow-to-finish pig farm. Approximately 35 % of <b>weaners</b> (1 - 3 weeks after weaning) presented clinical symptoms similar to Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS). About 2 - 3 weeks after weaning the first lesions of PNES occurred in approximately 20 % of pigs, resulting in a significant health problem characterized by poor growth or severe wasting and finally mortality up to 15 % in some batches. Moreover, approximately 5 % of survived <b>weaners,</b> during growing / finishing stage, presented poor growth and secondary co-infections that lead to death. The present study based on the clinical signs, serological and pathological examinations, indicates that <b>weaners</b> suffered by sub-acute PCV 2 infection resulting in PMWS associated with PNES. The lesions of PNES were initially observed at the same period (4 - 8 weeks of age) with the higher seroprevalence of PCV 2 infection. Metaphylaxis of this case included intramuscular injection of florfenicol for the treatment and control of skin lesions and respiratory signs. Moreover, piglets were vaccinated against PCV 2. In conclusion, sub-acute PCV 2 infection could be included in triggering factors PNES in <b>weaners.</b> The mass vaccination against PCV 2 of infected piglets might be effective in reduction of clinical signs and losses of PNES in cases of PCV 2 infection associated with PNES...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the diversity, clinical involvement and zoonotic potential of parasites in pigs submitted for diagnosis to the PathoPig project of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, faeces (n = 125) from suckling piglets (n = 39), <b>weaners</b> (n = 60) and piglets beginning fattening (n = 26) from 74 Swiss farms were examined by 3 coproscopical methods (i. e. sedimentation/zinc chloride-flotation; SAFC and Ziehl-Neelsen staining). Samples microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium were further tested by PCR/sequencing for species assessment. The most frequently detected parasite was Balantidium coli, a facultative pathogenic ciliate with zoonotic potential, in 5. 1, 36. 7 and 50. 0 % of suckling, <b>weaners</b> and fatteners and 43. 2 % of farms; however, no association with disease was observed. Isospora (syn. Cystoisospora) suis infections were detected in 13. 3 and 11. 1 % of suckling piglets with and without diarrhoea, and in 10. 0 and 13. 3 % of <b>weaners</b> and fatteners with diarrhoea, respectively, and were significant associated with emaciation. Cryptosporidium infections were detected in 10. 3, 15. 0 and 19. 2 % of sucklings, <b>weaners</b> and fatteners, respectively, and in 18. 9 % of the farms. Interestingly, two age-related species were identified: C. suis in younger piglets (2 to 6 weeks) and C. scrofarum in older ones (6 to 17 weeks). None of the pigs infected with C. scrofarum (n = 8), but 3 of 4 piglets infected with C. suis (co-infection with I. suis in 2 cases) had diarrhoea. The zoonotic species C. parvum was not detected, nevertheless, sporadic cases of human infection with the porcine-adapted species have been reported. Ascaris suum, Trichuris suis and Strongylida were rarely detected (< 4 %) in all age categories...|$|E
40|$|Nutrition {{influences}} reproductive {{efficiency and}} {{the survival of}} lambs and <b>weaners</b> but the costs of supplementary feeding or maintaining low stocking rates are not justified by the resulting income from higher lamb weaning rates and reduced weaner mortality. The current practice of segmenting the ewe flock using ultrasound scanning {{to determine the number}} of foetuses still results in groups of ewes {{with a wide range of}} condition scores and with widely differing nutritional requirements. This report describes an approach to precision management of pregnant ewes and <b>weaners</b> that is based on the e-sheep platform of technologies and uses computer-directed drafting for nutritional management of individual animals and walk-through weighing to monitor changing nutritional status. It is estimated that the cost of feeding a thousand-ewe flock can be reduced from $ 14, 000 for feeding all animals to $ 3300 for targeted feeding of 25 % of ewes requiring additional nutrition and 20 % of <b>weaners</b> at risk of dying. The cost of the targeted feeding strategy is more than justified by the value of additional 12 -month-old animals, which is $ 9000. The e-sheep precision nutrition system is not attractive to industry at this stage because of the cost of the e-sheep infrastructure, the perceived complexity of the technology and the requirement for further research, but it is expected to be a commercial option within three years...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{association}} between the seroprevalence in sows and the occurrence of Salmonella typhimurium among <b>weaners</b> has been shown. As shown several times for finisher herds, the risk-factors; ready-mixed pelleted feed and health status also apply to sow herds. Risk factors on the sow level, for high seroprevalence in finishers have been quantified...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was I: To {{evaluate}} the Salmonella reducing effect of feeding meal to sows compared to feeding pellets to sows. 2 : To evaluate the effect of the sow feed on the Salmonella shedding of the <b>weaners</b> at approximately 25 kg. There was no overall serological difference between sows fed meal and sows fed pellets over time. Individually there was a statistically significant drop in serology from blood samples taken in the gestation stables to blood samples taken in the farrowing stables. Meal fed sows experienced a drop of 4 OD% and pelleted fed sows had a drop of 6 OD%. This study did not find {{a significant difference between the}} Salmonella level of sows fed meal or sows fed pellets. There was a clear relation between the salmonella level of sows and <b>weaners.</b> Only exotic Salmonella serotypes were found...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that supplementation with Spirulina will increase liveweight, growth and body conformation with significant interactions between sire breed and sex {{was tested using}} purebred Merino <b>weaners</b> and first-cross <b>weaners</b> from Merino dams sired by Dorset, Black Suffolk and White Suffolk rams under the same pasture-based management system. Our experimental objective was to evaluate the effects of varying levels of Spirulina supplementation, sire breed and gender on liveweight and body conformation traits. We utilized a complete randomized block experimental design balanced by 4 sire breeds, 3 supplementation levels and 2 sexes in which weaned prime lambs with an average liveweight of 37. 6 ± 5. 2 kg and body condition score of 3. 1 ± 0. 4 at 6 months of age were balanced by sire breed and gender and randomly allocated into 3 treatments (8 lambs per treatment) – the control group grazing without Spirulina (0...|$|E
