Evra stated that he <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> Suárez's hand before the game, having refused to in a previous game.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{portion of}} NY117 in Katonah {{passed through a}} {{historic}} district containing several homes {{dating back to the}} late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from NY117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used NY117 <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> the historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY117 in Katonah began in 1976 {{at the request of the}} town of Bedford.|$|E

Akhenaten even moved the capital away from the city of Thebes in an effort to break the influence of that powerful temple and assert his own preferred choice of deities, the Aten. Akhenaten moved the Egyptian capital to the site known today as Amarna (though originally known as Akhetaten, 'Horizon of Aten'), and eventually suppressed the worship of Amun.|$|E

25|$|McCain then {{announced}} plans to reveal his running mate the day following {{the conclusion of the}} Democratic National Convention, and just {{a few days before the}} start of the Republican National Convention. During the running mate deliberations, McCain had favored Joe Lieberman, who shared his romantic sense of righteousness and honor. But the opposition from social conservatives, who objected to Lieberman's pro-choice views, was too strong, and a Lieberman pick might have caused a floor fight at the convention. McCain wanted someone who <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> up the race and reinforce his image as a maverick, so he decided against more conventional choices on his short list including Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty.|$|E
25|$|Implicit {{memory is}} the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's {{effect on our}} social interactions has been illustrated by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E

500|$|Kempelen would {{inform the}} player that the Turk {{would use the}} white pieces and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it {{threatened}} its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine [...] "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent {{was not to be}} so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her". Kempelen {{made it a point to}} traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Baby Shower" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on November 20. A technique called [...] "Poor Man's Process" [...] was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> the car {{to give the impression that}} it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the impression that it was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Antonio Ezequiel was killed, {{a mood of}} {{uncertainty}} surrounded civilians and authorities. Most feared that his death <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> the criminal underworld in Tamaulipas and herald more violence from Los Zetas, who might look {{to carry out a}} full-scale incursion in the Gulf Cartel territories and carry out kidnappings, extortions, and other violent acts in the state. Malcolm Beith, author of the book [...] "The Last Narco", stated shortly after Antonio Ezequiel's death that Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano was possibly going to move deep into Tamaulipas and try to fight the remaining forces of the Gulf Cartel, thereby creating more violence. Researcher Humberto Palomares said, [...] "They [...] cut off one head and many more grow back [...] ", in reference to the fall of Antonio Ezequiel. Stratfor and border security expert Sylvia Longmire, however, believed that Antonio Ezequiel's death was not going to drastically alter the dynamics of the criminal world, and that his absence may possibly bring some level of relative peace in the Tamaulipas area. The intelligence agency stated that Antonio Ezequiel was only a leader in the Gulf Cartel because of his brother Osiel; Costilla Sánchez, on the other hand, was the one who actually controlled the day-to-day operations. Antonio Ezequiel was also known for his explosive personality and cocaine addiction. It was rumored that the drug lord was hot-tempered and lived an outlandish lifestyle, and that many commanders within the Gulf Cartel believed in more than one occasion that his position as leader threatened the whole organization. Longmire believed that Los Zetas would move into Reynosa and Matamoros shortly after the drug lord's death to [...] "test the waters", but she stated that the Gulf Cartel, under the command of Costilla Sánchez, stood a chance to fight them off and continue its illicit activities.|$|E

500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew <b>would</b> <b>shake</b> the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E
