25|$|His {{last summer}} of {{first-class}} cricket was in 1972/73 when he represented Tasmania against Pakistan. The Tasmanians bowled first and Palfreyman went for 41 runs off his seven overs but {{threw the ball}} which ran out Talat Ali. When it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat, Palfreyman was dismissed by Intikhab Alam for a duck, with the Pakistani finishing with his career best figures of 8-54. After Tasmania followed on, Palfreyman yet again lost his wicket to a spin bowler, this time Nasim-ul-Ghani for one run.|$|E
25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri {{had already}} {{come under the}} {{influence}} of David Hare and Henry Vivian Derozio. Now it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be influenced by Thomas Babington Macaulay. Initially the English had sponsored classical education in India, based on Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, but as new ideas came from England, it was felt essential to introduce Indians to western education, particularly the sciences. There were strong protagonists on both sides. Indeed, the setting up of Hindu College in 1817 was a big step forward in the direction of western education.|$|E
25|$|The match {{ended with}} Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was {{surrounded}} by controversies. At {{the time of the}} match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than a dozen times, all at his turn to play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought {{for three and a half}} hours, only to adjourn the game. It was no secret that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.|$|E

500|$|Heath had {{a career-high}} 27 home runs during the 1947 season, but the Browns {{finished}} in eighth and last {{place in the}} AL. In the Browns' final game, Heath {{was already in the}} clubhouse showers when it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat in the ninth inning. Upon the conclusion of the season, [...] Browns management was looking to overhaul the team roster. Browns General Manager Bill DeWitt tried to shop Heath to a National League team rather than leave him in the AL. On 4 December it was announced the Boston Braves of the National League had acquired Heath.|$|E
500|$|As {{more troops}} were evacuated, more {{were ordered to}} {{withdraw}} from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} four matches of the series were drawn, the final Test, played at The Oval, was decisive. Aware that England had beaten Australia only once in 19 matches, the {{selectors}} made several changes to the team; Chapman, at the time fourth in the national batting averages, replaced Carr as captain. This decision was controversial; the press favoured Carr, particularly as Chapman was young, unproven as captain and not fully established in the team. When the match began on 14 August, Chapman won the toss and decided that England should bat first. When it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat, {{he was given a}} good reception by the crowd. During his innings, Wisden noted, Chapman [...] "hit out in vigorous fashion", but once he was dismissed for 49, the remaining batsmen were out quickly, leaving England with a disappointing total of 280. Australia replied with 302. On a pitch affected by rain, England then scored 436, mainly because of a large partnership between opening batsmen Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. Australia needed to score 415 to win, which was unlikely given the condition of the pitch. The team were bowled out for 125, and at least one of Chapman's tactical decisions resulted in Australia losing a wicket. Wisden reported that [...] "not a catch was missed nor was a run given away, the whole England side rising gallantly to the occasion. Naturally a scene of tremendous enthusiasm occurred at the end, the crowd swarming in thousands in front of the pavilion, and loudly cheering the players, both English and Australian." [...] The correspondent also commented [...] "Chapman... despite lack of experience in leading a first-class team in the field, turned out a very happy nomination for the post of captain, the young amateur, for the most part, managing his bowling with excellent judgement, and in two or three things he did, showing distinct imagination." [...] Throughout the match, Chapman chose to follow his own tactics rather than rely on the veteran players in the team for advice. In the series, he scored 175 runs at 58.33.|$|E

2500|$|The Minister of Cambuslang was an {{unlikely}} {{person to have}} organised this remarkable event. He was Mr William M’Culloch. Early on in {{his career as a}} Minister, he had confessed to a friend that he envied those who had felt called or converted to Christ. To him these feelings were completely alien. In addition, although he was an extremely learned and studious person, and a conscientious pastor to his , he was no great preacher. It was said that the ale houses filled up when it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> preach outdoors in traditional Scottish [...] "Sacramental Occasions" [...] or [...] "Holy Fairs", as they were called. This was when ministers and congregations of neighbouring parishes came together for several days of fasting, preaching and self-examination before receiving Holy Communion. One of these events is vividly, and humorously, described in one of Robert Burns’ poems, appropriately called ‘The Holy Fair’. It may be that the outdoor preaching of the First Great Awakening in New England had their origins in these Scots emigrant memories of these Holy Fairs.|$|E
2500|$|Rigoletto premiered on 11 March 1851 in a sold-out La Fenice as {{the first}} part of a double bill with Giacomo Panizza's ballet Faust. Gaetano Mares conducted, and the sets were {{designed}} and executed by Giuseppe Bertoja and Francesco Bagnara. The opening night was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica and the Duke's cynical aria, [...] "La donna è mobile", which was sung in the streets the next morning (Verdi had maximised the aria's impact by only revealing it to the cast and orchestra a few hours before the premiere, and forbidding them to sing, whistle or even think of the melody outside of the theatre). Many years later, Giulia Cora Varesi, the daughter of Felice Varesi (the original Rigoletto), described her father's performance at the premiere. Varesi was very uncomfortable with the false hump he had to wear; he was so uncertain that, even though he was quite an experienced singer, he had a panic attack when it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> enter the stage. Verdi immediately realised he was paralysed and roughly pushed him on the stage, so he appeared with a clumsy tumble. The audience, thinking it was an intentional gag, was very amused.|$|E
