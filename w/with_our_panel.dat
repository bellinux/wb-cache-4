40|$|Cities {{experience}} significant, near {{random walk}} productivity shocks, yet population is slow to adjust. In practise local population changes {{are dominated by}} variation in net migration, and we argue that understanding gross migration is essential to quantify how net migration may slow population adjustments. Housing is also a natural candidate for slowing population adjustments because {{it is difficult to}} move, costly to build quickly, and a large durable stock makes a city attractive to potential migrants. We quantify the influence of migration and housing on urban population dynamics using a dynamic general equilibrium model of cities which incorporates a new theory of gross migration motivated by patterns we uncover in a panel of US cities. After assigning values to the model's parameters with an exactly identified procedure, we demonstrate that its implied dynamic responses to productivity shocks of population, gross migration, employment, wages, home construction and house prices strongly resemble those we estimate <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> data. The empirically validated model implies that costs of attracting workers to cities drive slow population adjustments. Housing plays a very limited role...|$|E
40|$|First off, I want {{to thank}} Craig Thomas and Hillel Soifer for putting {{together}} an exciting set of panels, roundtables, and poster presentations for this year’s APSA meetings, {{to be held in}} Boston (see pages 39 - 43 for the listings). The section received a record number of submissions. Even <b>with</b> <b>our</b> large <b>panel</b> allocation, the division chairs were faced with some very difficult choices. Although they were able to field a substantial proportion of these proposals, there were of course some that the section was not able to include. The long-term solution is to secure a larger number of panels. Let me, therefore, take this opportunity to remind everyone that the section’s panel allocation at APSA 2009 depends not only on our submission rate but also, more importantly, on our attendance rate (which is carefully monitored by APSA).

The shape and nature of these binding sites differ across and even within diverse hepatitis C virus genotypes.

To address this, we have established a hepatitis C virus mutant and genotypic recombinant polymerase panel as a means of guiding medicinal chemistry through the elucidation of the site of action of novel inhibitors and profiling against genotypes. Using a genotype 1 b backbone, we demonstrate that the recombinant P 495 L, M 423 T, M 414 T, and S 282 T mutant enzymes can be used to identify the binding site of an acyl pyrrolidine analog.

40|$|Follistatin binds and neutralizes {{members of}} the TGFβ {{superfamily}} including activin, myostatin, and growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF 11). Crystal structure analysis of the follistatin-activin complex revealed extensive contacts between follistatin domain (FSD) - 2 and activin that was critical for the high-affinity interaction. However, it remained unknown whether follistatin residues involved with myostatin and GDF 11 binding were distinct from those involved with activin binding. If so, this would allow development of myostatin antagonists that would not inhibit activin actions, a desirable feature for development of myostatin antagonists for treatment of muscle-wasting disorders. We tested this hypothesis <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> of point and domain swapping follistatin mutants using competitive binding analyses and in vitro bioassays. Our results demonstrate that activin binding and neutralization are mediated primarily by FSD 2, whereas myostatin binding is more dependent on FSD 1, such that deletion of FSD 2 or adding an extra FSD 1 in place of FSD 2 creates myostatin antagonists with vastly reduced activin antagonism. However, these mutants also bind GDF 11, indicating that further analysis is required for creation of myostatin antagonists that will not affect GDF 11 activity that could potentially elicit GDF 11 -induced side effects in vivo...|$|E

40|$|MAP 1 B is a developmentally {{regulated}} microtubule-associated phosphoprotein {{that regulates}} microtubule dynamics in growing axons and growth cones. We used mass spectrometry to map 28 phosphorylation sites on MAP 1 B, and selected {{for further study}} a putative primed GSK 3 β site and compared it with two nonprimed GSK 3 β sites that we had previously characterised. We raised a panel of phosphospecific antibodies to these sites on MAP 1 B {{and used it to}} assess the distribution of phosphorylated MAP 1 B in the developing nervous system. This showed that the nonprimed sites are restricted to growing axons, whereas the primed sites are also expressed in the neuronal cell body. To identify kinases phosphorylating MAP 1 B, we added kinase inhibitors to cultured embryonic cortical neurons and monitored MAP 1 B phosphorylation <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> of phosphospecific antibodies. These experiments identified dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK 1 A) as the kinase that primes sites of GSK 3 β phosphorylation in MAP 1 B, and we confirmed this by knocking down DYRK 1 A in cultured embryonic cortical neurons by using shRNA. DYRK 1 A knockdown compromised neuritogenesis and was associated with alterations in microtubule stability.

40|$|Although {{there are}} nearly 100 {{different}} causative genes identified for nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), Sanger sequencing-based DNA diagnostics usually only analyses three, namely, GJB 2, SLC 26 A 4, and OTOF. As this is seen as inadequate, {{there is a need}} for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB 2 <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> leads to a diagnosis in 25 %- 30 % of patients. Our data show that after GJB 2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC 1, MYO 15 A, and MYO 7 A (3. 1 %). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants.

40|$|Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (I-INPCC) is an {{autosomal}} dominant syndrome characterized by predisposition {{to develop a}} number of neoplasms including colorectal, endometrium, urinary, extracolonic gastrointestinal, brain and ovarian cancers. HNPCC is caused by inherited mutations in DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes. Defective DNA Mismatch Repair results in genetic instability, which can easily be owerved inshort repetitive sequences as microsatellites (Microsatellite Instability, MSI). An international workshop on MSIheld in Bethesda in 1997 proposed a panel of live microsatellite markers {{to be used in}} MSI analysis. This panelincludes two mononucleotide repeats (BAT 25, BAT 26) and three dinucleotide repeats (D 2 SI 23, D 5 S 346 andDI 7 S 250). In our laboratory we are currently using a di&`erent microsatellite panel composed by threemononucleotide repeats (BAT 25, BAT 26, BAT 40) and two dimmleotide repeats (D 2 SI 23 and Dl 8 S 57). 'I`heaim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the specificity ofthe Bethesda markers, as compared <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel,</b> to idmtifyMLHI and MSIE mutation—positive IINPCC. We compared the results of MSI-analysis in cancer from 27 HNPCC Iizmilies (according to the Amsterdam criteria II) and ii•om 75 families in which not all the Amsterdamcriteria were met (Suspected IINPCC), using both the Bethesda and the alternative panel. In addition,immunohistochemistry of MLIII and MSH 2 proteins was pertbrmed in all tumors in order to study thecorrelation between the two MSI-panels and the expression of MLIII and MSIE proteins. Using the Bethesda markers, 49 (48 %) of tumors showed MSI. On the other hand, using the alternative panel, 33 (32, 3 %) of tumors and displayed MSI.

40|$|The most {{frequent}} chromosomal aberrations in B-cell {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (B-CLL) are deletions on 13 q, 11 q, and 17 p, and trisomy 12, {{all of which are}} of prognostic significance. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are used for their detection, but cytogenetic analysis is hampered by the low mitotic index of B-CLL cells, and FISH depends on accurate information about candidate regions. We used a set of 400 highly informative microsatellite markers covering all chromosomal arms (allelotyping) and automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols to screen 46 patients with typical B-CLL for chromosomal aberrations. For validation, we compared data <b>with</b> <b>our</b> conventional karyotype results and fine mapping with conventional single-site PCR. All clonal cytogenetic abnormalities potentially detectable by our microsatellite PCR (eg, del 13 q 14 and trisomy 12) were picked up. Allelotyping revealed additional complex aberrations in patients with both normal and abnormal B-CLL karyotypes. Aberrations detectable in the samples <b>with</b> <b>our</b> microsatellite <b>panel</b> were found on almost all chromosomal arms. We detected new aberrant loci in typical B-CLL, such as allelic losses on 1 q, 9 q, and 22 q in up to 25 % of our patients, and allelic imbalances mirroring chromosomal duplications, amplifications, or aneuploidies on 2 q, 10 p, and 22 q in up to 27 % of our patients. We conclude that allelotyping <b>with</b> <b>our</b> battery of informative microsatellites is suitable for molecular screening of B-CLL. The technique is well suited for analyses in clinical trials, it provides a comprehensive view of genetic alterations, and it may identify new loci with candidate genes relevant in the molecular biology of B-CLL...|$|R

Members of HNPCC families have a predisposition to the of colorectal cancer {{at an early}} age and an increased incidence of extracolonic cancer, e. g-, endometrium, ovaries, small bowel, biliary tract, renal pelvis and ureter. Gerrnline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, in particular MLI-Il and MSH 2, are present in individuals with I-INPCC. Defective DNA mismatch results in genetic instability, which can easily be observed in short repetitive sequences such as microsatellites instability, MSI). MSI has been detected in most MMR-deficient tumours and it is considered the of I-INPCC. An international workshop on MSI held in Bethesda in 1997 proposed a panel of live markers to be used in MSI analysis. This panel, lmown as "Bethesda markers", includes two reats (BAT 25, BAT 26) and three dinucleotide repeats (D 2 Sl 23, D 5 S 346 and Dl 7 S 250). ln our we are currently using a different microsatellite panel composed by three rnononucleotide repeats (BAT 25, BAT 40) and two dinucleoide repeats (D 2 Sl 23 and Dl 8 S 57).

Results. Using the Bethesda markers, 27 (36 %) out of the 75 Suspected HNPCC tumours and I 2 (70, 6 %) out of the HNPCC tumours showed MSI. On the other hand, using our alternative panel, 16 (21. 3 %) Suspected HNPCC and 7 (41, 2 %) HNPCC tumours displayed MSI. In Suspected HNPCC tumours we found I 5 (20 %) md 5 (6. 7 %) MSI., using the Bethesda panel and our alternative panel respectively, while in I-INPCC tumours no MSI-L was detected us either panel.

The ideas presented were positively received. Discussion focused on the systemic barriers for counsellors in terms of restrictions on their time, roles, and agency mandates. The powerpoint presentation is attached. Workshop B was also well attended. This was a different group of individuals who were also interested in how counsellors can {{have a positive impact on}} the systems that create problems for their clients in the first place. Part of the purpose of this session was to profile the social justice chapter of the Canadian Counselling Association, of which I am now the president. There was considerable interest generated and a number of means for continuing the work of the chapter through the year were suggested. We will be following up on a number of those over the summer, including setting up a discussion forum for Canadian counsellors interested in social justice activities. The powerpoint presentation is attached. Workshop C was a panel discussion that was not well attended, primarily due to scheduling alongside on of the keynote speakers for the conference. However, we did proceed <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> discussion and included the small audience in that dialogue. This was a good opportunity to touch base with counsellor educators across the country and see what others see as the current issues and trends. My focus was on distance education, primarily from a social justice perspective. This is a timely discussion because there is a lot of misinformation and bias in professional regulatory circles related to distance education professional programs and I am trying to be proactive in addressing some of these concerns. There was no formal presentation; however, I have provided my rough notes for this panel. Overall, I feel that my presence at this conference was important – particularly in terms of advancing the social justice agenda for counselling in Canada. I’m please to be part of this movement in its early phases. Workshop A: Across Canada, thousands of individuals face barriers to improving their mental, emotional, and economic status. In an effort to address the environmental factors (e. g., poverty) that impede client well-being, a growing number of counsellors have become interested in social justice interventions. For counsellors, social justice interventions involve actions that are designed to improve the equitable distribution of resources and services. This may include advocacy, outreach, and prevention. This workshop focuses on helping counsellors integrate social justice interventions into their roles. It will include a short lecture, discussion, and a video. Workshop B: The aim of this workshop is to provide participants with the opportunity to increase awareness of social justice issues in counselling practice and to learn practical ways to integrate this awareness into a variety of counselling settings and approaches. The workshop will consist of: 1) Stories from the field: narratives by practitioners from across Canada demonstrating the integration of social justice into counselling practice; 2) Discussion of how dominant discourses of pathology suppress awareness of the impact of structural violence on mental health and wellbeing; and 3) Participant activities designed to increase capacity and confidence in addressing social injustice in counselling practice. Symposium C: Cultural, professional and political influences have demanded counsellor education both lead and adapt to an ever-changing topography. Four counselor educators ranging from 3 - 30 years of experience from four different universities will address the changing landscape of counselor education with regard to one of four issues: counselor identity, training models/modes of delivery, supervision, and professional and academic politics. Interaction with the audience will invite discussion with regard to the influence and implications for the changing landscapes of these issues within the context of the conference sub-themes...|$|E

We aimed to identify new cervical neoplasia-specific DNA methylation markers and to design and validate a methylation marker panel for triage of high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) positive patients. First, high-throughput quantitative methylation-specific PCRs (QMSP) on a novel OpenArray (TM) platform, representing 424 primers of 213 cancer specific methylated genes, were performed on frozen tissue samples from 84 cervical cancer patients and 106 normal cervices. Second, the top 20 discriminating methylation markers were validated by LightCycler (R) MSP on frozen tissue from 27 cervical cancer patients and 20 normal cervices and ROCs and test characteristics were assessed. Three new methylation markers were identified (JAM 3, EPB 41 L 3 and TERT), which were subsequently combined with C 13 ORF 18 in <b>our</b> four-gene methylation <b>panel.</b> In a third step, <b>our</b> methylation <b>panel</b> detected in cervical scrapings 94 % (70 / 74) of cervical cancers, while in a fourth step 82 % (32 / 39) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN 3 +) and 65 % (44 / 68) CIN 2 + were detected, with 21 % positive cases for <= CIN 1 (16 / 75).

We employ a panel structure that permits us to separate regional, national and continental influences on European unemployment. Important local effects include the economic growth rate, relative wealth or poverty, {{and the proportion of}} young people in the labor force. As part of this analysis, we assess the relationship between pay inequality and unemployment in Europe, following the insight of Harris and Todaro (1970) that pay inequalities influence job search. <b>With</b> <b>our</b> own <b>panel</b> of inequality measures derived from Eurostat's REGIO data set, we find that higher pay inequality in Europe is associated with more, not less, unemployment, and the effect is stronger for women and young workers. There are modest country fixed effects for the UK and Spain, but large effects are found only for small countries. These are all negative, a fact that may be due partly to large past emigration in some cases, and partly to strategic wage bargaining in others. Apart from this, distinctive effects at the national level are few, perhaps indicating that national labor market institutions are not the decisive factor in the determination of European unemployment. Changes in the European macro-environment are picked up by time fixed effects, and these show a striking pan-European rise in unemployment immediately following the introduction of the Maastricht Treaty, though with some encouraging recovery late in the decade...|$|R

On a technical level, <b>our</b> bladder cancer <b>panel</b> yielded robust and reproducible results when analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. We applied <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> {{in the analysis of}} a novel set of 204 FFPE samples that included non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs), muscle invasive disease (MIBCs), and bladder cancer metastases (METs). We found NMIBCs to be mostly luminal-like, MIBCs to include both luminal- and basal-like types, and METs to be predominantly of a basal-like transcriptional profile. Mutational analysis confirmed the expected enrichment of FGFR 3 mutations in luminal samples, and, consistently, FGFR 3 IHC showed high protein expression levels of the receptor in these tumors. <b>Our</b> bladder cancer <b>panel</b> enables basal/luminal characterization of FFPE tissues and with further development could be used for stratification of bladder cancer samples in the clinic...|$|R

40|$|Pension {{reform is}} one of the biggest {{challenges}} facing national governments. How to reform the old pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems is still under hot debate; one of the most influential funded pension schemes is designed by the World Bank. In the second chapter of this paper, we first review the arguments for and against the PAYG and then critically discuss the World Bank model by drawing on related literature. The third chapter of this paper presents our empirical results. Regarding the link between economic growth and pension reform towards World Bank model, <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> estimation suggests a negative relationship in the short run and positive relationship in the long run, although the results for OECD countries are not very statistically robust. The second empirical work is focused on pension fund assets and economic growth. A positive link between these two variables is found by our standard economic growth specifications; in addition, there is evidence that pensions are a good predictor of economic growth. This result is then consolidated by <b>our</b> <b>Panel</b> Granger causality test. The last empirical work deals with the relationship between pension assets and financial development. On balance, <b>our</b> <b>Panel</b> correction model and Panel Granger causality test suggest that pension funds growth leads financial development, although some sub-group estimations are not strong. In addition, there is evidence that traditional banking industry is declining relative to other financial institutions, but not, even increasing relative to the economy...|$|R
