5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse {{have two}} plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E

40|$|Aims to {{describe}} the variation in breeding bird populations that occur on different types of Irish peatlands and their associated habitat characteristics. Methods: Bird abundance and diversity were compared between four peatland habitat types: fens; raised bogs; Atlantic blanket bogs; and montane blanket bogs at twelve study sites using transects. Various measures of habitat quality were also taken at each location. Results: Only 21 species were recorded during the study with Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and Sky Lark Alauda arvensis accounting for over 80 % of all birds recorded. Fens had greater bird species diversity and densities than the other three peatland types. Raised bogs, Atlantic blanket bogs and montane blanket bogs were very similar {{in terms of their}} avian diversity. Each of the recorded bird species were associated with different aspects of the peatland habitat. Conclusion: This study shows that despite the relatively low avian species diversity of Irish peatlands, they are of enormous conservation value due to the presence of species of high conservation concern such as Red <b>Grouse</b> (<b>Willow</b> Ptarmigan) Lagopus lagopus and Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata...|$|R
40|$|The early MIS 3 (55 – 40 Kyr BP {{associated}} with Middle Palaeolithic archaeology) bird remains from Pin Hole, Creswell Crags, Derbyshire, England are analysed {{in the context}} of the new dating of the site’s stratigraphy. The analysis is restricted to the material from the early MIS 3 level of the cave because the upper fauna is now known to include Holocene material as well as that from the Late Glacial. The results of the analysis confirm the presence of the taxa, possibly unexpected for a Late Pleistocene glacial deposit including records such as Alpine swift, demoiselle crane and long-legged buzzard with southern and/or eastern distributions today. These taxa are accompanied by more expected ones such as <b>willow</b> ptarmigan /red <b>grouse</b> and rock ptarmigan living today in northern and montane areas. Finally, there are temperate taxa normally requiring trees for nesting such as wood pigeon and grey heron. Therefore, the result of the analysis is that the avifauna of early MIS 3 in England included taxa whose ranges today do not overlap making it a non-analogue community similar to the many steppe-tundra mammalian faunas of the time. The inclusion of more temperate and woodland taxa is discussed in the light that parts of northern Europe may have acted as cryptic northern refugia for some such taxa during the last glacial. These records showing former ranges of taxa are considered in the light of modern phylogeographic studies as these often assume former ranges without considering the fossil record of those taxa. In addition to the anomalous combination of taxa during MIS 3 living in Derbyshire, the individuals of a number of the taxa are different in size and shape to members of the species today probably due to the high carrying capacity of the steppe-tundra...|$|R
60|$|Only one good-sized animal, {{so far as}} known, is now {{peculiar}} to the British Isles, {{and that is our}} familiar friend the red grouse of the Scotch moors. I doubt, however, whether even he is really indigenous in the strictest sense of the word: that is to say, whether he was evolved in and for these islands exclusively, as the moa and the apteryx were evolved for New Zealand, and the extinct dodo for Mauritius alone. It is far more probable that the red grouse is the original variety of the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> of Scandinavia, which has retained throughout the year its old plumage, while its more northern cousins among the fiords and fjelds have taken, under stress of weather, to donning a complete white dress in winter, and a grey or speckled tourist suit for the summer season.|$|E
60|$|Peculiar British Birds.--Among {{our native}} mammalia, reptiles, and amphibia, {{it is the}} opinion of the best {{authorities}} that we possess neither a distinct species nor distinguishable variety. In birds, however, the case is different, since some of our species, in particular our coal-tit and long-tailed tit, present well-marked differences of colour as compared with continental specimens; and in Mr. Dresser's work on the Birds of Europe they are considered to be distinct species, while Professor Newton, in his new edition of Yarrell's British Birds, does not consider the difference to be sufficiently great or sufficiently constant to warrant this, and therefore classes {340} them as insular races of the continental species. We have, however, one undoubted case of a bird peculiar to the British Isles, in the red grouse (Lagopus scoticus), which abounds in Scotland, Ireland, the north of England, and Wales, and is very distinct from any continental species, although closely allied to the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> of Scandinavia. This latter species resembles it considerably in its summer plumage, but becomes pure white in winter; whereas our species retains its dark plumage throughout the year, becoming even darker in winter than in summer. We have here therefore a most interesting example of an insular form in our own country; {{but it is difficult to}} determine how it originated. On the one hand, it may be an old continental species which during the glacial epoch found a refuge here when driven from its native haunts by the advancing ice; or, on the other hand, it may be a descendant of the Northern <b>willow</b> <b>grouse,</b> which has lost its power of turning white in winter owing to its long residence in the lowlands of an island where there is little permanent snow, and where assimilation in colour to the heather among which it lurks is at all times its best protection. In either case it is equally interesting, as the one large and handsome bird which is peculiar to our islands notwithstanding their recent separation from the continent.|$|E
60|$|Wherever all {{the world}} around is remarkably uniform in colour and appearance, all the animals, birds, and insects alike {{necessarily}} disguise themselves in its prevailing tint to escape observation. It does not matter in the least whether they are predatory or defenceless, the hunters or the hunted: {{if they are to}} escape destruction or starvation, as the case may be, they must assume the hue of all the rest of nature about them. In the arctic snows, for example, all animals, without exception, must needs be snow-white. The polar bear, if he were brown or black, would immediately be observed among the unvaried ice-fields by his expected prey, and could never get a chance of approaching his quarry unperceived at close quarters. On the other hand, the arctic hare must equally be dressed in a snow-white coat, or the arctic fox would too readily discover him and pounce down upon him off-hand; while, conversely, the fox himself, if red or brown, could never creep upon the unwary hare without previous detection, which would defeat his purpose. For this reason, the ptarmigan and the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> become as white in winter as the vast snow-fields under which they burrow; the ermine changes his dusky summer coat for the expensive wintry suit beloved of British Themis; the snow-bunting acquires his milk-white plumage; and even the weasel assimilates himself more or less in hue to the unvarying garb of arctic nature. To be out of the fashion is there quite literally {{to be out of the}} world: no half-measures will suit the stern decree of polar biology; strict compliance with the law of winter change is absolutely necessary to success in the struggle for existence.|$|E
6000|$|A {{very good}} example of {{comparatively}} recent divergence of character, in accordance with new conditions of life, is afforded by our red grouse. This bird, the Lagopus scoticus of naturalists, is entirely confined to the British Isles. It is, however, very closely allied to the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> (Lagopus albus), a bird which ranges all over Europe, Northern Asia, and North America, but which, unlike our species, changes to white in winter. No difference in form or structure can be detected between the two birds, but as they differ so decidedly in colour--our species being usually rather darker in winter than in summer, while there are also slight differences in the call-note and in habits,--the two species are {{generally considered to be}} distinct. The differences, however, are so clearly adaptations to changed conditions that we can hardly doubt that, during {{the early part of the}} glacial period, when our islands were united to the continent, our grouse was identical with that of the rest of Europe. But when the cold passed away and our islands became permanently separated from the mainland, with a mild and equable climate and very little snow in winter, the change to white at that season became hurtful, rendering the birds more conspicuous instead of serving as a means of concealment. The colour was, therefore, gradually changed by the process of variation and natural selection; and as the birds obtained ample shelter among the heather which clothes so many of our moorlands, it became useful for them to assimilate with its brown and dusky stems and withered flowers rather than with the snow of the higher mountains. An interesting confirmation of this change having really occurred is afforded by the occasional occurrence in Scotland of birds with a considerable amount of white in the winter plumage. This is considered to be a case of reversion to the ancestral type, just as the slaty colours and banded wings of the wild rock-pigeon sometimes reappear in our fancy breeds of domestic pigeons.[38] ...|$|E

The grouse can fly at up to 130 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} a diverse birdlife. Characteristic {{of the species}} is {{abundant}} southern avifauna, {{and on the other}} hand the occurrence of northern species, such as the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> and rustic bunting.

The symbol species of the park is Idaea muricata.|$|E
50|$|Birds include ducks, geese, American {{white pelican}} (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), sharp-tailed grouse (Tympahuchus phasianellus), <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> (Lagopus lagopus), common {{nighthawk}} (Chordeiles minor), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), common raven (Corvus corax), common loon (Gavia immer), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), {{northern hawk owl}} (Surnia ulula), great horned owl (Bubo viriginanus), American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) and double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus).|$|E
50|$|Heather is an {{important}} food source for various sheep and deer which can graze {{the tips of the}} plants when snow covers low-growing vegetation. <b>Willow</b> <b>Grouse</b> and Red Grouse feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant.

The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species also feed on the plant, notably the small emperor moth Saturnia pavonia.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the rare}} species {{listed in the}} Belarusian Red Book, the area {{is the home of}} the badger, lynx, brown bear, and swan. The swan was almost extinct in this area but now inhabits the Braslav lakes. Other native species include the black stork, common crane, silver seagull, <b>willow</b> <b>grouse,</b> and dunlin. The lakes of Braslav are rich with {{different}} kinds of fish. Pike perch, bream, whitebait, tench, whitefish are widespread. Eel is of special value. Also widespread are boar, roe deer, squirrel, brown and white hare, fox, raccoon, wolf, marten, otter, and mink.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{bird species}} {{brambling}} and rustic bunting {{are common in}} the park's forests. The most common bird species of the bogs is the yellow wagtail. The whimbrel also nests on the bogs. The barren Tiilikkajärvi lake is inhabited by the black-throated diver, and its beaches by the little ringed plover. Other species of the area include the lesser black-backed gull, capercaillie, <b>willow</b> <b>grouse,</b> bean goose, Eurasian golden plover, and the Siberian jay. In the summer of 1993, the pine grosbeak nested in the area. The beaver lives in the nearby rivers.|$|E

50|$|The {{valley and}} {{adjacent}} mountains have been valuable for hunting, animal trapping, and fishing for centuries. Snares are sometimes still set to catch ptarmigan and <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> {{in the traditional}} manner. Scots pine were used for timber and to produce tar. Nearly every farm in the valley earned extra income making tar, and production continued far into the 20th century. The remains of many tar kilns can still be found. The park and surrounding areas provided spring, summer, and autumn grazing for semi-domesticated reindeer. In winter, the reindeer in this region graze in the Kautokeino district in nearby Finnmark county; in summer, {{they are on the}} coast in the northwest.|$|E
50|$|In {{the region}} of the Turracher Höhe, the entire {{spectrum}} of the Alpine animal world is found, {{with the exception of the}} ibex, which was never indigenous here. Besides hoofed game animals (red deer, chamois, roe deer) and the corvids (raven, jackdaw, magpie), there are also four members of the pheasant family (capercaillie, black grouse, <b>willow</b> <b>grouse</b> and hazel grouse) in stable populations. In predatory game animals, there are fox, badger, pine marten, stone marten, European polecat, ermine and least weasel. Birds of prey, such as goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, European kestrel, golden eagle, as well as more rarely Eurasian hobby and peregrine are also seen here. From the nocturnal birds of prey, there are the Eurasian eagle-owl, tawny owl, Tengmalm's owl and Eurasian pygmy-owl. There are also marmots.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the European polecat, which feeds {{mostly on}} mouse-like rodents, the steppe polecat preys on larger, steppe-dwelling mammals such as ground {{squirrels}}, hamsters, pikas and young or injured adult marmots. Ground squirrels are its most frequent prey throughout the year; in warm periods, they are hunted on the surface, while in autumn they are excavated from their burrows. Male polecats {{often have to}} widen squirrel burrows to enter them, while young or female polecats can usually enter them easily. In areas where ground squirrels are absent, the steppe polecat feeds primarily on hamsters and pikas, or water voles {{on the banks of}} water bodies. Along the shores of rivers and lakes, fish, chickens and carrion may be prey. Birds occasionally killed by the steppe polecat include grey partridges and <b>willow</b> <b>grouse.</b> Amphibians and reptiles are rarely eaten.|$|E
50|$|The Gordon Setter {{is a large}} {{breed of}} dog, {{a member of the}} setter family that also {{includes}} both the better-known Irish Setter and the English Setter. Setter breeds are classified as members of either the Sporting or Gundog Group depending on the national kennel club or council. The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. Their quarry in the United Kingdom, may be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock: whilst overseas bird dogs are worked on quail, <b>willow</b> <b>grouse,</b> sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin and any other bird that will sit to a dog—that is to say, will attempt to avoid a potential predator by concealment rather than by taking to the wing {{at the first sign of}} danger. It is this combination of a bird that will sit fast in front of a dog that will remain on point that makes bird dog work possible.|$|E
50|$|The nest is {{a shallow}} {{depression}} or scrape on the ground, often in cover, with a scanty lining of plant material. The female lays one clutch, but may replace {{it if the}} eggs are lost. She begins to lay {{about a week after}} mating and lays one egg every day or two; the clutch comprises five to 12 eggs. The eggs have the shape of hen's eggs and are pale yellow, sparsely spotted with brown. On laying the second-last or last egg, the female starts 21 to 28 days of incubation. Chicks hatch in dense, yellow-brown down and leave the nest immediately. They soon develop feathers and can fly shortly before they are two weeks old. The female (and the male in the <b>willow</b> <b>grouse)</b> stays with them and protects them until their first autumn, when they reach their mature weights (except in the male capercaillies). They are sexually mature the following spring, but often do not mate until later years.|$|E
