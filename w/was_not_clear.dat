5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> what would take its place.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} McKinley was nominated, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an {{organized}} effort {{to take over}} the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Mr. Niebla {{suffered}} an injury, which forced CMLL to vacate the CMLL World Trios Championship as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> when Mr. Niebla {{would be able}} to wrestle again. They held a three-show, eight-team tournament from December 4 to December 12, 1998. Former champions Atlantis and Lizmark teamed up with Emilio Charles Jr. for the tournament, while Mr. Niebla actually returned to action in time to be in the tournament as well, teaming up with Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Shocker. In the finals the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther and Black Warrior defeated Los Guapos (Scorpio Jr., Bestia Salvaje and Zumbido) to lay claim to the championship.|$|E

50|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Jean-Claude Trichet <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>cleared</b> {{of legal}} accusations before 1 June 2002, so he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> able {{to begin his}} term after Duisenberg's first four years. Even on 9 July 2003 Trichet <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>cleared,</b> and therefore Duisenberg remained in office until 1 November 2003. Duisenberg died on 31 July 2005.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{parliamentary}} election after the war, in 1945, Meisdalshagen was re-elected {{for a second}} term in Parliament. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that he would be nominated for the ballot, as this was not at all usual for those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King's abdication. However, Meisdalshagen's service in Milorg probably tipped the scales in his favour. He {{was a member of the}} Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory Credentials Committee, and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946. Meisdalshagen was also board chairman of the Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1946 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> how {{the fight}} started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans {{throwing}} beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir {{and three other}} men for the stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder {{and was sentenced to}} 15 years imprisonment. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E

5|$|October 4 also {{provided}} another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who {{became aware that}} evening that EgyptAir, the country's national airline, had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by October 5 flights were back to their normal schedule. It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis {{were aware of the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|Phat was {{supposed}} to seize the Bien Hoa Air Base to prevent air force chief Kỳ from mobilising air power against them, but he failed to reach the airfield before Kỳ, who circled Tan Son Nhut and threatened to bomb the rebels. Most of {{the forces of the}} III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. However, as night came, senior military opinion began to turn against Thảo and Phát, although it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> at this stage whether the anti-Thảo forces being organised and led by Thi were hostile to Khánh as well.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E

5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of the WAVES and Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent {{two or three days}} at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then the price of a ticket home. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether demobilization meant phasing women out of the military services altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one {{professional}} football team, Arbroath, who play in Scottish League One, the third tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Arbroath play their home matches at Gayfield Park, which holds {{the record for}} being the closest stadium to the sea in European football (around 5½ yards from the high tide line). Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Further goals were disallowed either for offside, or because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether the ball {{had gone into the}} goal. For this reason the AFC supporters' club is called the 36–0 club in memory of this event. Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Vietnamese {{military}} was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> where the sympathies {{of the respective}} officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and Kỳ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Khánh in September 1964, and he had also been reported by the CIA in December 1964 as having vowed to kill Khánh. Although Kỳ had made comments hinting threats to Khánh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally hardline Catholic Diệm supporterssuch as Thảowho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup. Meanwhile, the likes of Thiệu, Có and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious {{in comparison to the}} flamboyant and impetuous Kỳ and Thi. They maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, Kỳ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Khánh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thiệu.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E
5|$|Once {{news of the}} Ottoman {{approach}} arrived, Venice sent reinforcements to its cities along Albania; Durazzo (Durrës) {{had already}} garrisoned 3,000 men. The Scutari Fortress was also reinforced after Skanderbeg's counsel and the walls were rebuilt. On 19 April 1466, news spread that the sultan was going to march into Avlonya (Vlorë) with an army of 100,000 men although the Ragusans reported that the number was 30,000. Ottoman forces were ready to enter the Kingdom of Naples and pressured Ferdinand to form an alliance with Mehmed. The situation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> in the Balkans, however, as {{it was thought that}} the Ottomans could march against Bosnia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Negroponte, or Albania. By the beginning of May, however, {{it was clear that the}} Ottomans would attack Albania because of the approach of Mehmed's troops towards Albania after the end of his campaigns in Wallachia, Karaman, and the Morea. None of the promised reinforcements from Naples and Venice arrived and Skanderbeg was thus left to fight Ottoman forces only with the league's troops.|$|E
