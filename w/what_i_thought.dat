5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E

25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said I would come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E

'You must know, I'm in love with her,' he added resolutely." ...|$|E

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E

For the Glass Swords album cover, Whyte was shown various designer's portfolios by Warp. Whyte chose Jonathan Zawada, as he felt it had a [...] "'70s sci-fi art feel". After discussing ideas with Whyte, Zawada gave him the album cover in a few days. When asked about the album cover resembling two erect penises, Whyte responded [...] "Everyone says that!

Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published by the}} Evening Standard in two parts on 22 and 23 April 1970, McCartney said: [...] "The album was finished a year ago, but {{a few months ago}} American record producer Phil Spector was called in by Lennon to tidy up some of the tracks. But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, horns, an orchestra, and a women's choir added. No one had asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> I couldn't believe it." [...] The Beatles' usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes [...] "so uncharacteristic" [...] of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as [...] "revolting … just puke".|$|E
500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking.

It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{her death}} Brennan and Crowley began telling people about Richard and Richard's family {{became aware that}} there was a belief that she was [...] "special." [...] Floyd Calais, a Catholic priest who was at the time the {{chaplain}} of Charity Hospital in Lafayette, was a close friend of Brennan. In 1961, Calais began praying to Richard to be assigned to a parish. He was assigned to St. Edwards parish in Richard, Louisiana—Richard's burial place—that same year. Once there, he discovered the need to raise money to build a new church there. Calais says that he was [...] "invited to retreats and recollections, and began speaking about Charlene, how she achieved grace before she died" [...] and about the need for money to build a new church in the parish. [...] "People started going to her grave," [...] he said, [...] "and began sending checks to build the church. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> would take 8–10 years took 2 1/2." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E

500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} the song again on her 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, while playing an electric guitar and adding vocoder voice {{effects on the}} background harmonies. The singer {{was dressed in a}} black leotard and fishnet tights. She also wore a white hat and black leather boots. During the performance a video backdrop portrayed American singer Britney Spears trapped in an elevator and trying to get out, while kicking the walls. At the end of the performance, the doors opened to reveal Spears saying the phrase [...] "It's Britney, bitch", from her song [...] "Gimme More" [...] (2007). Madonna explained that she intended the video to stand as an analogy of Spears' career, saying [...] "Didn't that explain <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought?</b> 'I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me". On November 6, 2008 in the Los Angeles show at Dodger Stadium, Spears joined Madonna onstage halfway through the performance. Aidin Vaziri from Gibson.com was positive in his review, saying that the best moment of the tour was when Madonna picked up her black Les Paul guitar and emulated musician Slash while performing the song. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine was negative in his review of the performance, saying that by the time the performance of [...] "Human Nature" [...] had started, [...] "it's the same as all her shows: A remixed mind-fuck". The performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's four shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E
