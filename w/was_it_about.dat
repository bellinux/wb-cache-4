[...] Biographer Barbara Goldsmith claimed {{she was also}} starved and sexually abused by her father when still very young. She based her incest claim on a quote from Theodore Tilton's biography, [...] "But the parents, as if not unwilling {{to be rid of}} a daughter whose sorrow was ripening her into a woman before her time, were delighted at the unexpected offer." [...] Biographer Myra MacPherson disputes Goldsmith's claim that [...] "Vickie often intimated that he sexually abused her" [...] as well as the accuracy of Goldsmith's quote, [...] "Years later, Vickie would say that Buck made her 'a woman before my time.'" [...] Macpherson wrote [...] "Not only did Victoria not say this, there was no 'often' involved, nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> incest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pietrzak's mother, Henryka Pietrzak-Varga has {{repeatedly}} stated {{she believes the}} murders were racially motivated, as her son and daughter-in-law were not affluent individuals. On November 11, 2008 (Veteran's Day), Pietrzak's mother composed a formal letter to president-elect Barack Obama in which she discussed what her son and daughter-in-law had endured, and the possible primary motive for the murders. In this letter, Henryka stated: [...] "If it was a robbery, why didn't they come when nobody was home instead of {{in the dead of}} night, armed to the teeth? ... What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> my son and daughter-in-law that inspired such hatred and loathing?" [...] Seven months later on July 27, 2009, the Obama administration responded with generic form letter of the type issued to all soldiers killed in combat. When knowledge of this indirect, insincere reply reached the news media, the Obama administration issued an apology.|$|E

40|$|What makes a {{successful}} entrepreneur? Just as with great quarterbacks, entrepreneurs come {{in many different}} packages, with certain personality traits correlating with success. To start, entrepreneurs have a total passion {{for what they are}} doing. This article discusses additional traits and abilities that do not guarantee success, but which appear to be common to many successful entrepreneurs. Being an entrepreneur is not about a bank account, nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> prestige or headlines. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> a life journey of enjoying what one <b>is</b> doing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> the opportunity to help people, whether they are customers, employees, partners, or capital providers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> developing long-term relationships. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> retiring not when one can, but when one wants. This <b>is</b> what <b>it</b> means to <b>be</b> an entrepreneur...|$|R

Yes, let us hope {{he thought of her}} a little. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> Miss Fotheringay, and his eternal passion, which had kept him awake so many nights, and created such wretchedness and such longing? He had a trick of blushing, and if you had been in the room, and the candle had not been out, you might have seen the youth's countenance redden more than once, as he broke out into passionate {{incoherent}} exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life. His uncle's lessons had not been thrown away upon him; the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now, and he saw her as she was. To think that he, Pendennis, had been enslaved by such a woman, and then jilted by her! that he should have stooped so low, to be trampled on the mire! that there was a time in his life, and that but a few months back, when he was willing to take Costigan for his father-in-law! ...|$|E

What on earth <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>ABOUT?</b> She had to wager with herself that she would turn the page before she ate another. In fact she slept. But then her day {{had been a long}} one, Mother Stuart had thrown the tea-cosy;--there are formidable sights in the streets, and though Florinda was ignorant as an owl, and would never learn to read even her love letters correctly, still she had her feelings, liked some men better than others, and was entirely at the beck and call of life. Whether or not she was a virgin seems a matter of no importance whatever. Unless, indeed, it is the only thing of any importance at all.|$|E

No--it was a photograph--she was going over some old things." [...] Alison ceased speaking abruptly, for the pain in Mr. Bentley's remarkable grey eyes had not escaped her. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> him? Why could she not recall? Long-forgotten, shadowy episodes of the past tormented her, flitted provokingly through her mind--ungrasped: words dropped in her presence which had made their impression, but the gist of which was gone.

At ten o'clock, when she returned, the light {{was out in the}} diningroom, her sister had not come in, and she began slowly to undress, pausing every now and then to sit on the bed and dream; once she surprised herself gazing into the glass with a rapt expression that was almost a smile. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> her that had attracted Ditmar? No other man had ever noticed it. She had never thought herself good looking, and now--it was astonishing!--she seemed to have changed, and she saw with pride that her arms and neck were shapely, that her dark hair fell down in a cascade over her white shoulders to her waist. She caressed it; it was fine. When she looked again, a radiancy seemed to envelop her. She braided her hair slowly, in two long plaits, looking shyly in the mirror and always seeing that radiancy....|$|E
60|$|Mrs. McIntyre {{took me in}} a very marked {{way into}} her good graces, and I had every {{opportunity}} to ride, walk, sketch, and otherwise to attend upon Mary; and Mary was gracious also, but so quietly and discreetly mistress of herself that I could not {{for the life of}} me tell what to make of her.

Or was there any old affair? etc., etc. Not that it was any business of mine; but then a fellow likes to know his ground before--Before what? I thought to myself, and that unknown WHAT every day assumed new importance in my eyes. Mary had many admirers. Her quiet, easy, self-possessed manners, her perfect tact and grace, always made her a favorite; but I could not help hoping that between her and me there was that confidential sense of a mutually kept secret which it is delightful to share with the woman you wish to please.|$|E
