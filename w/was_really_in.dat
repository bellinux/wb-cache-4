However, things turn sour when Jill has an affair with Kay's neglected husband who didn't love her, Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes). Jill ends up pregnant, and Phillip divorces Kay in the Dominican Republic. Kay offered to drive him home from the airport, but ends up running the car over a cliff, killing him. On his death bed, he invalidly married Jill. Kay offered Jill $1 million for her baby, which she declined. She gave birth to Phillip Chancellor III (eventually portrayed by Thom Bierdz) in 1976. She romances David Mallory, who was the recipient of her late father Bill's eye cornea. However, she never loved him. He proposed, but she declines after Liz warned her of a loveless marriage. She {{had an affair with}} Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue) and later romanced Stuart Brooks (Robert Colbert), whose wife Jennifer had just died. He <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> love with her mother Liz, but Jill tricked him into marriage following a one-night stand. He left her after she faked a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jill wanted to reunite with Derek, who marries Katherine after she promised him a salon and a $100,000 trust for Jill's son. Derek's ex-wife Suzanne Lynch (Ellen Weston) arrives in town and wanted him back. Kay was briefly presumed dead and finding himself free of Suzanne and Kay, Derek planned to marry Jill.

On March 10, 2017, Mayweather stated that only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement. On March 16, 2017, Dana White backpedaled on his stance against Mayweather {{fighting}} McGregor {{and said that he}} would not deprive McGregor of making a massive payday. On May 18, 2017, McGregor reportedly agreed to all of Mayweather's updated terms and signed the contract.|$|E

25|$|When {{civil war}} broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Red Alert joined the Autobot cause. Red Alert acted as an advisor to Optimus Prime when he became the new Autobot leader. After the Great Shutdown ended Red Alert was reformatted into an Earth-style car.

Despite reservations by Perceptor about Shockwave's true motives, they dispatched Ultra Magnus to stop the Stunticons.|$|E
25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E

She {{writes the following}} about Verona: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> Italy. Not Maya Angelou, the person of pretensions and ambitions, but me, Marguerite Johnson, who had read about Verona and the sad lovers {{while growing up in}} a dusty Southern village poorer and more tragic than the historic town in which I now stood." ...|$|E

C. J. Godfrey {{has argued that the}} {{donation}} <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> return for the papal approval of Offa's scheme to elevate the diocese of Lichfield to an archdiocese. Whatever Offa's motivation, historians have generally seen the gift as the beginning of Peter's Pence, an annual [...] "tax" [...] paid to Rome by the English Church.|$|E

It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1943 Judge Green {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps, the {{predecessor}} to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially [...] "optimistic that the military {{was going to be}} a good life," [...] until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city." [...] It was then that Green [...] "realized for real that I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> a segregated army, and there was always, as long as I was in the service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> front of the green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Channel V Australia, he recalled {{that the two of}} them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed, [...] "on an organisational level", thus accelerating the process. Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff. She <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E

500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{called it}} an [...] "uneven ending"; he praised it for being [...] "visually clever" [...] and liked the way the Silence were handled, but thought the Teselecta {{solution}} was [...] "a bit of a cop-out". Neela Debnath of The Independent was displeased with the episode, calling it a [...] "brainteaser" [...] that [...] "refused to tie up the loose ends neatly", and that as a finale it was [...] "underwhelming in terms of drama and overwhelming in terms of information". However, she praised the fact that Moffat appears to be spreading storylines over several series, believing it [...] "strengthens the show". On the other hand, HitFix's Alan Sepinwall thought that the resolutions from the wedding on were [...] "excellent", but felt it could have done without another alternate universe, as it {{was similar to the}} previous finale [...] "The Big Bang". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad criticised the episode for having too many [...] "bells and whistles" [...] which undermined the emotional moments, especially the wedding, which she did not believe showed that the Doctor <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> love with River. However, she did enjoy [...] "callbacks" [...] to previous episodes such as Churchill and Amy and Rory's relationship. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 thought it was better than the previous finale, [...] "The Big Bang", as there were more answers, fun, and a satisfying resolution. However, she was critical of the reason River had to kill the Doctor as well as their relationship, and believed that Amy's killing Madame Kovarian was [...] "no substitute" [...] for Amy's dealing with what Kovarian had done to her child.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Burr {{was rumored to}} be romantically {{involved}} with Natalie Wood. Wood's agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers, and so the men she dated could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates also helped to disguise Wood's relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. Burr felt enough attraction to Wood to resent Warner Bros.' decision to promote her attachment to Tab Hunter rather than him. Robert Benevides later said, [...] "He was a little bitter about it. He <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> love with her, I guess." ...|$|E
