5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated.

5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of Rasanayagam Mudaliar and Swami Gnanapragasar the Aryacakravarti dynasty <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Rasanayagam {{believes}} that a Brahmin {{from the town of}} Rameswaram married into the surviving family members of the Kalinga Magha, an invader claiming to be from Kalinga kingdom in India. Magha apparently belonged to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The Royal flag of the Jaffna kingdom is similar to the Royal insignia of the Eastern Gangas. Gangas themselves also claimed Brahmin origins. The Setu coins minted by the Aryacakravarti kings also have a similar symbol.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south.

5|$|On the {{northern}} side of canal was the terminus for the tramroad which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits.

The southern side of the canal basin <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pits at Brittens, Littlebrook, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill by a tramway which terminated at Salisbury Colliery.

5|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning and weaving {{led to a}} considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry.

The legacy of Leigh's industrial past {{can be seen in}} the remaining red brick mills– some of which are listed buildings– although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.|$|E
