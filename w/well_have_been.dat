5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger.

5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E

25|$|Shale {{gas in the}} United Kingdom has {{attracted}} increasing attention since 2007, following the large-scale production of natural gas from shales in the US and Canada. A number of <b>wells</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> drilled and a single shale gas <b>well</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> hydraulically fractured, but as of August 2016, there <b>has,</b> as yet, <b>been</b> no commercial production of shale gas in the UK.|$|R

5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter {{appears to have been}} a kinsman of Echmarcach, and may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and {{early the next morning}} the revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr may very <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E

She was accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting Amelie von Orthenburg and Madame de Moy, the latter of whom had traveled from Germany and had stayed with her as dame d'honneur since 1409. Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey) who may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an eyewitness.|$|E

5|$|It may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> these Inquisitors who, in 1543, {{decided that}} Mercator was eminent {{enough to be}} sacrificed. His name {{appeared}} {{on a list of}} 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.|$|E
5|$|Ruler 4 was {{succeeded by}} K'inich Ich'aak Chapat in 723. Around 725 Toniná fought {{a war against}} Piedras Negras, a city on the north bank of the Usumacinta River, now in Guatemala. A series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicated the tomb of his {{predecessor}} K'inich B'aaknal Chaak. The mother of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is named as Lady Winik Timan K'awiil and his father may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> K'inich B'aaknal Chaak himself. The reign of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is notable {{for the absence of}} the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives, although {{the reason for this is}} unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus, {{writing in}} the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides {{an account of the}} Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, it may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> derived from Herodotus's version. The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.|$|E

5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the 1940s. It {{began with}} what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; {{it may be}} as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written after the mission.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E
5|$|In some places, {{the secular}} clergy {{who had been}} driven from the monasteries returned, driving the regular clergy out in their turn. Bishop Æthelwold had been the main enemy of the seculars, and Archbishop Dunstan appears to {{have done little to}} aid his fellow {{reformer}} at this time. More generally, the magnates took the opportunity to undo many of Edgar's grants to monasteries and to force the abbots to rewrite leases and loans to favour the local nobility. Ealdorman Ælfhere was the leader in this regard, attacking Oswald's network of monasteries across Mercia. Ælfhere's rival Æthelwine, while a staunch protector of his family monastery of Ramsey Abbey, treated Ely Abbey and other monasteries harshly. At some point during these disorders, Ælfhere and Æthelwine appear to have come close to open warfare. This may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> related to Ælfhere's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey. Æthelwine, supported by his kinsman Ealdorman Byrhtnoth of Essex and others unspecified, mustered an army and caused Ælfhere to back down.|$|E
