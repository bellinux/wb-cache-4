60|$|Peter Rabbit hurried along {{through the}} moonlight, {{stopping}} {{every few minutes}} to sit up to look and listen. He heard the fierce hunting call of Hooty the Owl way over in the Green Forest, so he felt sure that at present {{there was nothing to}} fear from him.

6000|$|But Jim lay long awake, {{nervous and}} twitching, rolling about restlessly and rolling himself wide awake {{every time he}} dozed. The {{diamonds}} still blazed under his eyelids, and the fire of them hurt. Matt, {{in spite of his}} heavy nature, slept lightly, like a wild animal alert in its sleep; and Jim noticed, every time he moved, that his partner's body moved sufficiently to show that it had received the impression and that it was trembling on the verge of awakening. For that matter, Jim did not know whether or not, frequently, the other was awake. Once, quietly, betokening complete consciousness, Matt said to him: [...] "Aw, go to sleep, Jim. Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> jools. They'll keep." [...] And Jim had thought that at that particular moment Matt had been surely asleep.|$|E

6000|$|Wyllard smiled. [...] "Generally; that is, if I haven't {{been doing}} much just before. It depends upon one's hands.

Still, as I said, we never shoot them unless Mrs. Nansen wants one or two for the pot." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is one of}} the {{advantages}} of that magnificent invention, the prison, that you may forget people whom are put there as though they were dead. One needn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Nothing can happen to them that you can help. They can do nothing which might possibly matter to anybody. They come out of it, though, but that seems hardly an advantage to themselves or anyone else. I had completely forgotten the financier de Barral. The girl for me was an orphan, but now I perceived suddenly the force of Fyne's qualifying statement, [...] "to a certain extent." [...] It would have been infinitely more kind all round for the law to have shot, beheaded, strangled, or otherwise destroyed this absurd de Barral, who was a danger to a moral world inhabited by a credulous multitude not fit to take care of itself. But I observed to Fyne that, however insane was the view she held, one could not declare the girl mad on that account.|$|E

5000|$|If {{you want}} {{long-term}} benefit, {{it is better}} not to take that position, although if this is indeed {{the will of the}} Emperor, it is fine to do so.

60|$|The {{next six}} months passed over quietly and happily.

50|$|English {{left the}} UDP in 1998 {{after making a}} public {{statement}} against the Orange Order {{at a time when}} the party was widely supporting them in their attempts to march in Catholic areas.
