5|$|Vrba {{is clear}} that warning the Hungarian {{community}} {{was one of the}} motives for his escape. He wrote that in January 1944 a Polish kapo told him that a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive at Auschwitz, and that a new railway line was being built to accommodate them. He also overheard SS guards discuss how they <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> eating Hungarian salami.|$|E
5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> made irrelevant by aircraft. By {{the end of}} World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.|$|E

The free population {{in the whole of}} Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 citizens, of which 1,195 were free people of color. Additionally, 1,785 slave owners in the county held 11,376 people in bondage, about one-quarter of the total county population of 41,130 people.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided {{funding for the}} restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E

5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} {{what had happened to the}} characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{effects of}} the announcement of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered, and Germans remained in control over Lithuania. The situation changed only when Germany lost World War I {{in the fall of}} 1918. In November 1918 the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed, and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania. Independent Lithuania, although it <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> battling the Wars of Independence, became a reality.|$|E

After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image.

5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E
5|$|Alsos {{interviewed the}} Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, {{the staff of}} the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian {{scientists}} at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E

5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him to sign off on the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> another election, in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E
