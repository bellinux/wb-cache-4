It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> so far, {{how much do we}} have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case may be), just to look at if.|$|E

500|$|By 1967, as Hendrix {{was gaining}} in popularity, {{many of his}} pre-Experience {{recordings}} were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums, sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix. The recordings, which came {{under the control of}} producer Ed Chalpin of PPX, with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965, were often re-mixed between their repeated reissues, and licensed to record companies such as Decca and Capitol. Hendrix publicly denounced the releases, describing them as [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "greatly inferior", stating: [...] "At PPX, <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> on average about one hour recording a song. Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song." [...] These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue, amounting to hundreds of albums.|$|E

There, {{she told him she}} was a singer and gave him a copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> a day together and worked on a couple of things, and went to record shops where I played samples to her.

500|$|Three {{weeks after}} Marky joined the band, the Ramones began {{recording}} Road to Ruin in Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, {{the premises of}} a former Episcopalian Church. [...] Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: [...] "After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the Road to Ruin album with Marky. We rehearsed a long time with Marky, just getting it down. Then {{we went into the}} studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of money, and the entire summer, on Road to Ruin." [...] Music critic John Young of Rolling Stone called the album's production [...] "clean and simple", but pointed out that the track [...] "Bad Brain" [...] contained [...] "funny noises" [...] in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended.|$|E
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{described}} the episode as [...] "a great end to {{what may have}} been my favorite season of The Office to date." [...] He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments, including Michael's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent moment in which Jim learns Pam is pregnant. Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which she said she did not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as we expected, capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just laugh line after laugh line, reminding us all [...] <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> time talking about this show every week." [...] Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending: [...] "They didn’t stupidly dramatize it, and it ended up being a really nice, really fitting end" [...] to the season.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Jay-Z {{released}} his twelfth studio album Magna Carta...

West and Jay-Z argued for four days about having them included on the Watch the Throne, however West eventually relented and the duo recorded [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". In an interview with Zane Lowe, Jay-Z said: [...] " [...] no lyrics on 'Holy Grail' and I recorded 'Oceans' and I played those records for Kanye," [...] Jay explained. [...] "And he was like, 'No those {{have to go on}} Watch the Throne,' so <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> four days arguing about those records and I was explaining to him why it wasn't right for this project and I had a whole idea for making this album called Magna Carta...

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that's it. They never showed us any accounts, and then they got bought out by Sony." ...|$|E
