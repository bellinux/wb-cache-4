5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business,</b> the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Bevin {{took over}} {{management}} of the struggling Bevin Brothers Manufacturing Company of East Hampton, Connecticut. Founded in 1832 by Bevin's great-great-great grandfather and remaining in the family continuously since, Bevin Bros. is the last American company that exclusively manufactures bells. By 2011, the company owed $116,000 in delinquent taxes and was named the number one delinquent tax firm in East Hampton. Collectively, the Bevins decided that Matt was the only family member <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> acumen and financial wherewithal to keep the company solvent.

5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the {{background}} not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune {{on the back of}} Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
