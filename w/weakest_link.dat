40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Learning ballet is {{connected}} with continuous use of the locomotor system while subject-ing it to high loads. Therefore, we conducted some research defining the appearance of <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> in the motor system, in order to eliminate the risk of injury. [Methods] Fifty-two female students of a ballet school were ex-amined. To identify <b>weak</b> <b>links,</b> low-threshold Performance Matrix tests were performed. An analysis of <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> occurrence in the locomotor system was carried out, using two way analysis of variance ANOVA Tukey’s HSD test, clustering methods and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). [Results] The {{average age of the}} subjects was 11. 64 ± 0. 53 years (mean ± standard deviation), their average body height was 151. 1 ± 7. 5 cm, their average body weight was 35. 92 ± 5. 41 kg, and their average time of learning at ballet school was 2. 17 ± 0. 65 years. We found that there were significant differences in <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> occurrence in the motor system of every girl examined. [Conclu-sions] <b>Weak</b> <b>links</b> were found in every location of the motor system. Our results show that the influence of <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> location is essentially different from their occurrence, and that learning ballet has a significantly different impact on the number of <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> in different locations...|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{the failed}} BTT kits {{revealed}} that the failure was in the cables {{and not in the}} <b>weak</b> <b>links.</b> In all cases, the failure was by overload and there were no evidences to suggest that there was sudden deterioration in the mechanical properties of the cables due to increase in the environment temperature beyond critical temperatures. The possibility of fusion in any of the components of the <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> leading to non-breakage of the <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> ahead of the fracture of the cables during acceleration runs {{at the end of the}} trials is also ruled out. Examination of the data provided and the laboratory test results showed that the breaking load of the cables of the BTT kits is lower than that of the <b>weak</b> <b>links.</b> Hence, the failure observed in the BTT kits during Phase IV trials is quite natural. Analysis shows that the dimension of the shear pin chosen for the <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> is not appropriate for the present flying conditions. In view of this, it is recommended that the design of the <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> is revisited and a margin of 150 - 200 kg is built in so that the <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> fail ahead of the BTT cables as desired...|$|R

(vii) A {{comparison}} {{between these two}} transitional models leads to some general remarks which are employed later: both models incorporate all possibilities of Jackson and Wolinsky’s model without decay: strong links with 0 -friction, but their stability differs {{in each of the}} models. Strong links are less stable w.r.t. withdrawal of support in JWBG 2, where a <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> remains after withdrawal of support by one player allowing information to flow in both directions, while in JWBG 1 no information flows through the remaining <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> toward the player that withdraws support. As to the stability of <b>weak</b> <b>links,</b> the situation is the opposite (w.r.t. being doubled): <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> are more stable in JWBG 2, where the incentives for doubling them are smaller than in JWBG 1. Concerning externalities, the externalities of <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> are greater in JWBG 2 than in JWBG 1.|$|R

The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., Greed, Twenty One, etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as Winning Lines, <b>Weakest</b> <b>Link,</b> and It's Your Chance of a Lifetime).|$|E

40|$|Weak {{connections}} between superconductors or superfluids can differ from classical links due to quantum coherence, which allows flow without resistance. Transport properties through such <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> {{can be described}} with a single function, the current-phase relationship, which serves as the quantum analog of the current-voltage relationship. Here, we present a technique for inteferometrically measuring the current-phase relationship of superfluid <b>weak</b> <b>links.</b> We interferometrically measure the phase gradient around a ring-shaped superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing a rotating <b>weak</b> <b>link,</b> allowing us to identify the current flowing around the ring.

40|$|We have {{observed}} well-defined phase slips between quantized persistent current states around a toroidal atomic (23 Na) Bose-Einstein condensate.

When the <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> is rotated more rapidly, well-defined phase slips no longer occur, and vortices enter into the bulk of the condensate.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of the Josephson critical current through LSCO/LCO/LSCO thin films showed an unusually large proximity effect. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for a tight binding Hamiltonian we describe the proximity effect in <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> between a superconductor with critical temperature $T_c$ and one with critical temperature $T_c$', where $T_c>T_c$'. The <b>weak</b> <b>link</b> (N') is therefore a superconductor above its own critical temperature and the superconducting regions are considered to have either s-wave or d-wave symmetry. We note that the proximity effect is enhanced due {{to the presence of}} superconducting correlations in the <b>weak</b> <b>link.</b> The dc Josephson current is calculated, and we obtain a non-zero value for temperatures greater than $T_c$' for sizes of the <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> that can be almost an order of magnitude greater than the conventional coherence length. Considering pockets of superconductivity in the N' layer, we show that this can lead to an even larger effect on the Josephson critical current by effectively shortening the <b>weak</b> <b>link.</b> Comment: submitted to Physical Review...|$|R

Authors: Shuchang Lu, Yufan Gu & Radzion Predko Tutor: Åsa Gustafsson Examiner: Dr. Lars-Olof Rask Course: 4 FE 06 E - Master Thesis Research Questions: • Why do cold chain products have quality risk? -  What kind of <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> exist in distribution process of cold chain? -  What kind of risks exist in <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> of distribution process of cold chain? -  How to assess risks in <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> of distribution process of cold chain? Background: The increasing food wastes and starving {{people have made}} food preserved by cold chain as a significant and profitable issue. An effective and efficiency cold chain {{can make a big}} difference in the whole food supply chain around the world. With the improvements of modern technologies, cold chain distribution is experiencing changes. Purpose: To identify <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> in distribution channel of cold chain products. What kind of risks exist in these weak inks and how to assess them. Method: Positivistic is used throughout the paper. Multiple exploratory case study is our way of research our problems. Data were gathered from interview, documents and company’s website. Conclusions: Human handling in delivery process, the way retailers deal with frozen products, how do different participants manage their resources and safety of product and its quality are main reasons for quality risk. Risks in <b>weak</b> <b>links</b> can cause product quality problem in cold chain distribution channel. Therefore, assess these risks can help managers to deal with them.
