Most of the current Skeleton development effort has been put into establishing indexing and query formulation methodologies in which both words and character subsequences of <b>words</b> (<b>ngrams)</b> are tokenized. A Web-based interface has been developed for Skeleton which includes a Java image display applet to support word and region highlighting. ...|$|R

The NRC system uses various statistical classifiers trained on character and <b>word</b> <b>ngram</b> features. Predictions rely on a two-stage process: we first predict the language group, then discriminate between languages or variants within the group. This year, we focused on two issues: 1) the ngram generation process, and 2) {{the handling of the}} anonymized (2 ̆ 01 cblinded 2 ̆ 01 d) Named Entities.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{relative}} effects of segment order, segmentation and segment contiguity on the retrieval {{performance of a}} translation memory system. We take a selection of both bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive string comparison methods, and run each over both characterand word-segmented data, in combination {{with a range of}} local segment contiguity models (in the form of N-grams). Over two distinct datasets, we find that indexing according to simple character bigrams produces a retrieval accuracy superior to any of the tested <b>word</b> <b>Ngram</b> models. Further, in their optimum configuration, bag-of-words methods are shown to be equivalent to segment ordersensitive methods in terms of retrieval accuracy, but much faster. We also provide evidence that our findings are scalable. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a corrective model for speech recognition of inflected languages. The model, {{based on a}} discriminative framework, incorporates <b>word</b> <b>ngrams</b> features as well as factored morphological features, providing error reduction over the model based solely on word n-gram features. Experiments on a large vocabulary task, namely the Czech portion of the MALACH corpus, demonstrate performance gain of about 1. 1 – 1. 5 % absolute in word error rate, wherein morphological features contribute {{about a third of}} the improvement. A simple feature selection mechanism based on χ 2 statistics is shown to be effective in reducing the number of features by about 70 % without any loss in performance, making it feasible to explore yet larger feature spaces. ...|$|R
40|$|Prompt and {{knowledgeable}} responses to customers’ emails are critical in maximizing customer satisfaction. Such emails often contain complaints about unfair treatment due to negligence, incompetence, rigid protocols, unfriendly systems, and unresponsive personnel. In this paper, {{we refer to}} these emails as emotional emails. They provide valuable feedback to improve contact center processes and customer care, as well as, to enhance customer retention. This paper describes a method for extracting salient features and identifying emotional emails in customer care. Salient features reflect customer frustration, dissatisfaction with the business, and threats to either leave, take legal action and/or report to authorities. Compared to a baseline system using <b>word</b> <b>ngrams,</b> our proposed approach with salient features resulted in a 20 % absolute F-measure improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{context-free}} grammars (CFGs) {{remain as}} one of the most important formalisms for interpreting natural language, <b>word</b> <b>ngram</b> models are surprisingly powerful for domain-independent applications. We propose to unify these two formalisms for both speech recognition and spoken language understanding (SLU). With portability as the major problem, we incorporated domainspecific CFGs into a domain-independent n-gram model that can improve generalizability of the CFG and specificity of the n-gram. In our experiments, the unified model can significantly reduce the test set perplexity from 378 to 90 in comparison with a domainindependent word trigram. The unified model converges well when the domain-specific data becomes available. The perplexity can be further reduced from 90 to 65 with a limited amount of domain-specific data. While we have demonstrated excellent portability, the full potential of our approach lies in its unified recognition and understanding that we are investigating. 1...|$|R
40|$|Detecting {{whether a}} talker is {{speaking}} his native language {{is useful for}} speaker recognition, speech recognition, and intelligence applications. We study the problem of detecting nonnative speakers of American English, using two standard speech corpora. We apply approaches effective in speaker verification to this task, including systems based on MLLR, phone N-gram, prosodic, and <b>word</b> <b>Ngram</b> features. Results show equal error rates between 12 % and 20 %, depending on the system, test data, and choice of training data. Asymmetries in performance are most likely explained by differences in native language distributions in the corpora. Model combination yields substantial improvements over individual models, with the best result being around 8. 6 % EER. While phone Ngrams are widely used in related tasks (e. g., language and dialect ID), we find {{that it is the}} least effective model in combination; MLLR, prosody, and word N-gram systems play stronger roles. Overall, results suggest that individual systems and system combinations found useful for speaker ID also offer promise for nonnativeness detection, and that further efforts are warranted in this area. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ngram {{models are}} simple in {{language}} modeling {{and have been}} successfully used in speech recognition and other tasks. However, they can only capture the short distance context dependency within an n-words window where currently the largest practical n for a natural language is three {{while much of the}} context dependency in a natural language occurs beyond a three words window. In order to incorporate this kind of long distance context dependency in the ngram model of our Mandarin speech recognition system, this paper proposes a novel MI-Ngram modeling approach. This new MI-Ngram model consists of two components: a normal ngram model and a novel MI model. The ngram model captures the short distance context dependency within an n-words window while the MI model captures the context dependency between the word pairs over a long distance by using the concept of mutual information. That is, the MI-Ngram model incorporates the word occurrences beyond the scope of the normal ngram model. It is found that MI-Ngram modeling has much better performance than the normal <b>word</b> <b>ngram</b> modeling. Experimentation shows that about 20 % of errors can be corrected by using a MI-Trigram model compared with the pure word trigram model. ...|$|R

We use the subsumption hierarchy in two ways: (1) as an analytic tool to automatically identify complex features that outperform simpler features, and (2) to reduce a feature set by removing unnecessary features. We show that reducing the feature set improves performance on three opinion classification tasks, especially when combined with traditional feature selection. ...|$|R
