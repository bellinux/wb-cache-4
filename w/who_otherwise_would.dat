5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened {{the entire length of}} the National Mall as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E

5|$|Truman's unit {{joined in}} a massive {{prearranged}} assault barrage on September 26, 1918, {{at the opening of}} the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and they set up an observation post west of Cheppy. On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery, and then he ordered his men to open fire. The enemy battery was destroyed. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed or otherwise punished.|$|E
25|$|In the Clinic sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who {{achieved}} sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings, and AA {{attendance was}} associated with good outcomes in patients <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been predicted not to remit. In the Core City sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed—after all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons. The implication from all three samples was simply that many alcoholics find help through AA.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved {{on a shoestring}} budget with the automaker racking up a respectable number of points against its giant competitors.

With these portraits he created a monument to many of his friends and acquaintances <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> long be forgotten, portraits, which always reflect his own personality, too.

From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion {{of a large number of}} applicants <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, the Office of Transportation {{adopted the}} Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study, a study for an {{extension}} of the streetcar to the Lloyd and Central Eastside Industrial Districts. In part, the desire for an eastside streetcar arose from the July 2001 report, Lloyd District Development Strategy. Proponents see it as a component of a potential transportation hub in the Lloyd District, bringing together the streetcar, MAX and bus service. Additionally, the new streetcar line will provide a transit connection between the Lloyd and Central Eastside districts that supporters believe is more attractive and permanent than the bus service (TriMet line 6) currently provided and is more likely to spur development in those areas. Existing businesses along the route have also voiced strong support for the project, believing it will bring new customers <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> be more likely to shop in nearby downtown.|$|E

25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} the medical establishment.

As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the three heads of Keter, {{according}} to the kabbalists, has extremely different connotations from ascribing validity to any compound or plurality in God, even if the compound is viewed as unified. In Kabbalah, while God is an absolutely simple (non-compound), infinite Unity beyond grasp, as described in Jewish philosophy by Maimonides, through His Kabbalistic manifestations such as the Sephirot and the Shekhinah (Divine Presence), we relate to the living dynamic Divinity that emanates, enclothes, is revealed in, and incorporates, the multifarious spiritual and physical plurality of Creation within the Infinite Unity. Creation is plural, while God is Unity. Kabbalistic theology unites the two in the paradox of human versus Divine perspectives. The spiritual role of Judaism is to reach the level of perceiving {{the truth of the}} paradox, that all is One, spiritual and physical Creation being nullified into absolute Divine Monotheism. Ascribing any independent validity to the plural perspective is idolatry. Nonetheless, through the personalised aspects of God, revealing the concealed mystery from within the Divine Unity, man can perceive and relate to God, <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> be unbridgably far, as the supernal Divine emanations are mirrored in the mystical Divine nature of man's soul.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{a mysterious}} new witch comes into play, being {{revealed}} to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E

500|$|Genetic {{tests are}} {{available}} for the ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4 mutations. Testing is not always needed for diagnosis, because the symptoms are sufficient to distinguish the disease from other diagnoses. There are situations in which testing can be particularly useful. Firstly, {{children and young adults}} with a parent with definite HHT may have limited symptoms, yet be at risk from some of the complications mentioned above; if the mutation is known in the affected parent, absence of this mutation in the child would prevent the need for screening tests. Furthermore, genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis in those with limited symptoms <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been labeled [...] "possible HHT" [...] (see below).|$|E

One such event, a newly created [...] "People's Inaugural Ball" [...] was held for economically and physically disadvantaged people from across the United States <b>who</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. EarlW. Stafford, a businessman from Fairfax County, Virginia, spent an estimated $1.6million through his family's foundation to bring approximately 300guests to Washington,D.C., hosting the ball on January 19, 2009 for a total of about 450people. Clothing, shoes, tuxedos and hotel rooms for attendees were provided as part of the invitation.|$|E
