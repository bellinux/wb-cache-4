25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to get married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles {{to support the}} film's main theme of redemption. According to Favreau, Meacham's teaching Doc how to shoot not only references similar scenes in other Westerns but also [...] "teach him {{how to be a}} person". Meacham's dying words to Jake, [...] "God don't care <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> Son, only who you are", speaks of the central theme of redemption. The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a [...] "good spirit" [...] that could represent either Alice or Ella; an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake [...] "get over" [...] Alice. Favreau also suggested a back-story to Cowboys & Aliens: the über-alien is the mastermind of the invasion; all other aliens are [...] "worker bees", possibly genetically engineered by another species of aliens that remained on their home planet and sent the worker bees as conquistadors.|$|E
500|$|On the 41st {{episode of}} Transmission Gagavision, Gaga {{announced}} that the song {{was going to be}} released soon. She added the abstract message along with the announcement: [...] "Let the cultural baptism begin. If they were not <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> taught they would be, would you still believe?" [...] "Judas" [...] was scheduled to be sent to mainstream airplay on April 19, 2011, and digital retailers on the same day, but after the track was leaked to the internet, its release was brought forward to April 15, 2011. This was done to counteract the pre-release leaks. Before the release, Gaga tweeted about the single, saying: [...] "#PawsUpForJudas! I've learned love is like a brick, you can build a house or sink a dead body." [...] On April 15, 2011, hours before the song was played on radio she again tweeted: [...] "Even After Three Times He Betrays Me," [...] she wrote, harking back to the song's lyrics about love and betrayal. In the United Kingdom, the song premiered on The Capital FM Network on April 15, 2011, during their program Home Run. Gaga addressed the leak in the 43rd episode of Transmission Gagavision, likening it to a disembodiment, saying, [...] "A slow death! Just put me out of my f---ing misery, just put that sh-- out. They were tearing [...] limb for limb. First it was the arm of the song, then the liver...." ...|$|E
