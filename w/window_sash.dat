25|$|As {{part of the}} {{architectural}} investigation conducted by Architectural Resources Group in 1998, wood samples were taken from various locations throughout the building, and the majority found were coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The samples that were not redwood came from <b>window</b> <b>sash</b> and areas of the building {{known to have been}} repaired previously with Douglas fir. In addition, through visual inspection, it was determined that there was a significant amount of redwood in the building despite the various repair campaigns that occurred throughout the years.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included <b>window</b> <b>sash</b> locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E

2500|$|The William Moss House is {{a two-story}} duplex located at 528 West Genesee Street. This {{house was built}} in {{approximately}} 1908, and is unusual in Iron County as a middle-class duplex, more so because the floor plans {{of the first and}} second floor are dissimilar. It is likely that the original owner, William Moss, occupied the first floor and let out the second. The house is a two-story structure with hipped roof, bracketed eaves, and narrow clapboard siding. It has an Ionic front porch and geometric pattern <b>window</b> <b>sash.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Comet cleared Duluth, Minnesota on 23 August 1875 {{bound for}} Buffalo, New York with {{intermediate}} stops on Lake Superior. After she had rounded Whitefish Point Light on a clear, starlit night about 8:05 PM of 26 August 1875 and was heading on the usual southeast course to Point Iroquois Light, her lookout spotted a white {{light in the}} dusk right on their course. Fifteen minutes later, after the lookout spotted a red light, Captain Dugat altered course a point to port, heading southeast half south. Just moments later the green lights of an approaching vessel appeared. When Captain Dugat realized he had swung across the bow of a steamer, he blew one blast on the whistle and ordered a hard turn, {{but it was too}} late. Shipwreck historian Janice Gerred reported that the [...] "Canadian steamer Manitoba struck the Comet stem on about , forward the stern on the port side right down to the water’s edge." [...] The Toronto Globe reported an eye witness account that Comets hull parted and sank almost immediately; the upper works crumbled and sank within one minute. Two men were crushed when the steamers collided. One man was hanging from a <b>window</b> <b>sash</b> on Manitoba, lost his grip, and was heard exclaiming, “Oh Lord, I am gone” as the suction of the wreck pulled him down. Ten men, including those below deck, did not survive. Six men jumped from the wreck to the decks of Manitoba whose boats picked up four more survivors. Captain Dugat, the master, two shipmates, two wheelsmen, one fireman, one lookout, and one porter survived. Manitoba made every effort to save everyone possible. She took the rescued to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where they were given passage to Cleveland.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{problems}} with solid wooden <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> include rot, swelling or {{distortion of the}} woodwork or rattling in the wind (due to shrinkage of the wood). These problems can be solved by careful repair {{and the introduction of}} draught stripping. It is also a common problem for inexperienced painters (or experienced painters without any sash-painting experience) to paint the sash stuck. The sliding mechanism makes <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> more vulnerable to these problems than traditional casement <b>windows.</b> <b>Sash</b> <b>windows</b> are relatively high maintenance, but offer advantages in return (style, aesthetics, abides by laws (relating to older houses and buildings), natural resources etc.). However, well-maintained <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> should last generations without needing parts replaced.

60|$|Tom gave up {{the brush}} with {{reluctance}} in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when {{the middle of the}} afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old <b>window</b> <b>sash.</b>|$|E
60|$|Though much shyer {{than other}} birds of the farm, he often ventures {{up close to}} the house and doorway in the early morning, before any one is stirring. One spring morning I was awakened by a strange little pattering sound, and, opening my eyes, was {{astonished}} to see one of these birds on the sash of the open window within five feet of my hand. Half closing my eyes, I kept very still and watched. Just in front of him, on the bureau, was a stuffed golden-wing, with wings and tail spread to show to best advantage the beautiful plumage. He had seen it in flying by, and now stood hopping back and forth along the <b>window</b> <b>sash,</b> uncertain whether to come in or not. Sometimes he spread his wings as if on the point of flying in; then he would turn his head to look curiously at me and at the strange surroundings, and, afraid to venture in, endeavor {{to attract the attention of}} the stuffed bird, whose head was turned away. In the looking-glass he saw his own movements repeated. Twice he began his love call very softly, but cut it short, as if frightened. The echo of the small room made it seem so different from the same call in the open fields that I think he doubted even his own voice.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{house for}} the first year or so was {{on the top of a}} cliff, so that in stormy weather the spray would {{sometimes}} soak my bed at night, for I had taken the glass out of the <b>window,</b> <b>sash</b> and all. A literary passion for the open air was to last me for a few years. Then for another year or two, we had a house overlooking the harbour where the one great sight was the going and coming of the fishing fleet. We had one regular servant, a fisherman's wife, and the occasional help of a big, red-faced girl who ate a whole pot of jam while my mother was at church and accused me of it. Some such arrangement lasted until long after the time I write of, and until my father going into the kitchen by chance found a girl, who had been engaged during a passing need, in tears at the thought of leaving our other servant, and promised that they should never be parted. I have no doubt that we lived at the harbour for my mother's sake. She had, when we were children, refused to take us to a seaside place because she heard it possessed a bathing box, but she loved the activities of a fishing village. When I think of her, I almost always see her talking over a cup of tea in the kitchen with our servant, the fisherman's wife, on the only themes outside our house that seemed of interest--the fishing people of Howth, or the pilots and fishing people of Rosses Point. She read no books, but she and the fisherman's wife would tell each other stories that Homer might have told, pleased with any moment of sudden intensity and laughing together over any point of satire. There is an essay called [...] "Village Ghosts" [...] in my [...] "Celtic Twilight" [...] which is but a record of one such afternoon, and many a fine tale has been lost because it had not occurred to me soon enough to keep notes. My father was always praising her to my sisters and to me, because she pretended to nothing she did not feel. She would write him letters telling of her delight in the tumbling clouds, but she did not care for pictures, and never went to an exhibition even to see a picture of his, nor to his studio to see the day's work, neither now nor when they were first married. I remember all this very clearly and little after until her mind had gone in a stroke of paralysis and she had found, liberated at last from financial worry, perfect happiness feeding the birds at a London window. She had always, my father would say, intensity, and that was his chief word of praise; and once he added to the praise [...] "no spendthrift ever had a poet for a son, though a miser might." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> or hung <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> {{is made of}} one or more movable panels, or [...] "sashes", {{that form}} a frame to hold panes of glass, which are often {{separated}} from other panes (or [...] "lights") by glazing bars, also known as muntins in the US (moulded strips of wood). Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash, the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically, or horizontally in a style known as a [...] "Yorkshire light", sliding sash, or sash and case (so called because the weights are concealed in a box case). The oldest surviving examples of <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> were installed in England in the 1670s, for example at Ham House. The invention of the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> is sometimes credited, without conclusive evidence, to Robert Hooke. Others see the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> as a Dutch invention. H.J.
