One day, when an abandoned baby was left on her doorstep, Rosie took him in and tried to find him a new home.

40|$|In Delta Scuti star models, the {{calculated}} amplitude ratios and phase differences for multi-colour photometry exhibit a strong dependence on convection. These observables are tools for {{determination of the}} spherical harmonic degree of the excited modes. The dependence on convection enters through the complex parameter f, which describes bolometric flux perturbation. We present a method of simultaneous determination of f and spherical harmonic degree from multi-colour data {{and apply it to}} three Delta Scuti stars. The method indeed <b>works.</b> <b>Determination</b> of the degree appears unique and the inferred f's are sufficiently accurate to yield a useful constraint on models of stellar convection. Furthermore, the method helps to refine stellar parameters, especially if the identified mode is radial. Comment: 9 pages, 12 figures, to appear in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
