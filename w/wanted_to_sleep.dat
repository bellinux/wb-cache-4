[...] She was suing because Wick's programs contributed to sexual harassment in her workplace. [...] Wick claimed Woo brought suit because she had a [...] "slutty little Asian thing going", and Woo said that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with Wick because if she did, she would kill him. The character proved to be a hit, and Liu was signed on as a regular for the series.|$|E

[...] Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was [...] "the only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without blushing and who would order {{corn on the cob}} in a Paris restaurant."

500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

Sørlie and Haukelid went below deck to the keel where they spent two hours placing [...] of plastic explosive; they placed it in a circular formation [...] long.
