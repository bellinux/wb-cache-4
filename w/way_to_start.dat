25|$|The miners sank their shafts in {{turns of}} up to , each turn being {{a few yards away}} {{from the bottom of the}} {{preceding}} one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> and finish a day's work. These climbing shafts were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start.</b> Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E

[...] Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the [...] "left-libertarian hostility to religion".

Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic.

This single remains Morrison's biggest US hit (as of 2010), as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit [...] "Brown Eyed Girl", from the album Blowin' Your Mind!. [...] "Domino" [...] was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40. Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine attributed the success of [...] "Domino" [...] to the guitar figure {{at the beginning of the}} track, which he considered [...] "not only a great <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a single, but a fine way to begin the album".

Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' is a great <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the record, because it is emotional and it kind of speaks directly to the questions people might have about the last year of her life.

500|$|After he was {{appointed}} Commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), Jackson was promoted to acting lieutenant general in January 1997, a rank he was granted substantively in April 1997. Jackson served in the NATO chain of command, reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, American four-star General Wesley Clark. Under Jackson's command, the ARRC deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1999, where Jackson served his second {{tour of duty in}} the Balkans, commanding KFOR, NATO's multi-national peacekeeping force established {{at the end of the}} Kosovo War. He gained significant media attention in June 1999 after a confrontation with Clark in which he refused to block the runways of the Russian-occupied Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian troops there, thus preventing them from flying in reinforcements, after the order was queried by Captain James Blount. In one heated discussion with Clark, Jackson reputedly told him [...] "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". He later told the BBC he believed that obeying the order would have led to the possibility of an armed confrontation with Russian troops, which he felt was not [...] "the right <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> off a relationship with Russians". The point became moot when the US government prevailed upon neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania, to prevent Russian use of their airspace to fly in reinforcements. Jackson was criticised for his actions by American military officers and politicians, including General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called the incident [...] "troubling", and Senator John Warner, who accused Jackson of insubordination.|$|E
500|$|As a batsman, Hammond {{started the}} tour well, scoring 208 {{in an early}} game, but lost form once the Tests began. One of the turning points of the series was a disputed catch in the first Test. Bradman, who looked in poor form and {{uncertain}} to continue his cricket career for much longer, had reached 28 when the English team believed he had edged the ball to Jack Ikin at slip. Bradman, as was his entitlement, waited for the umpire's decision instead of leaving the field. The fielders were certain that he was out, but the umpire said he was not, believing the ball had bounced before it was caught; opinion among other participants and spectators was divided. However, Hammond was extremely angry, saying loudly, either to Bradman or the umpires, [...] "a fine fucking <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a series". Afterwards, relations between Hammond and Bradman deteriorated {{and there was a}} coldness between them. Bradman went on to score 187 and Australia won the match and, ultimately, the series. In that first Test, Hammond played two good innings on a very difficult wicket, but in the series, he did not pass fifty, scoring 168 runs at an average of 21.00 before missing the final Test. In all first-class cricket, he scored 633 runs (average 45.21). He suffered increasing pain from fibrositis throughout the series, and later admitted that he felt close to a breakdown. Hammond played his last Test in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour, scoring 79 in his final innings. He ended his career with 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.46. His 22 centuries remained an English record until surpassed by Alastair Cook in December 2012.|$|E

He also liked the game's music and graphics, although he critiqued the latter a little due to low-res battle models. Meghan Sullivan of IGN called the story, music and visuals [...] "great", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface. Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places. Kimberley Keller of Nintendo World Report, reviewing all versions of the game, generally praised the game as a whole while calling Birthright the [...] "perfect <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> [...] " [...] due to its traditional Fire Emblem elements. Griffin McElroy and Allegra Frank of Polygon, reviewing all versions of the game, were generally positive about the gameplay and the interplay between versions, while criticizing the overly complicated character class system. They referred to Birthright as a [...] "straightforward march for vengeance, where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader".

However, he said it felt like Victor was killed rather than Walter or Jesse simply because the writers could not kill the two main protagonists. Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com {{called it a}} [...] "great and intriguing <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the season" [...] and particularly praised Aaron Paul, who he said was [...] "phenomenal" [...] despite barely speaking any dialogue in the episode. However, he had [...] "mixed feelings" [...] about the Gus character's evolution from a behind-the-scenes criminal to a hands-on killer. Jessica Johnson of Time Out Chicago called it an [...] "exquisite exercise in tension" [...] that builds a [...] "slow crescendo of what looks to be an impressively strong season". Andy Vineberg of the Bucks County Courier Times called it [...] "a great start for a show that just keeps getting better". He praised the dark humor that kept the tension of the show balanced, and particularly complimented the pre-credits scene and the ramifications it had for the show and its characters. RedEye writer Curt Wagner found that the cinematography, pacing and tension were so effective in [...] "Box Cutter", that [...] "I think I broke a sweat just watching". Paste magazine writer Brent Koepp praised the transformation of Walter, and said few other shows would risk making their protagonist so unlikeable.
