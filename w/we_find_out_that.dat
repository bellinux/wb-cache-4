25|$|The first season's {{main focus}} is Serena van der Woodsen's sudden {{return to the}} Upper East Side {{following}} her mysterious disappearance. Everyone is extremely shocked at her sudden return after first sightings of her spread across the web, when she is spotted at Grand Central station including her best friend, Blair Waldorf. It turns out Serena returns from Boarding School to see her suicidal brother, Eric. Blair soon finds out that Serena had slept with her boyfriend, Nate Archibald, the night of her disappearance. Meanwhile, Brooklyn boy Dan Humphrey and Serena begin dating while Nate struggles with his feelings for Blair. The two try to salvage what's left of their relationship, only leaving Blair to lose her virginity to Nate's best friend, Chuck Bass, instead. Jenny Humphrey constantly tries {{to make it in}} this upscale world by following around Blair and her friends. Rufus Humphrey, her father, worries that Jenny may be losing herself as she strives for popularity. Vanessa Abrams, Dan's best friend, returns. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Dan had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends, considering Dan is now with Serena. It is discovered that Lilly van der Woodsen and Rufus Humphrey have a romantic past, yet both struggle with other relationships. The two decide to see other people in light of their children's romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex, despite her affair with Chuck. Nate finds out about the affair and he and Chuck stop associating with one another. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, comes back and causes havoc, including outing Eric van der Woodsen. Georgina's return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, since Serena tries to hide her secret from him and Georgina (pretending to be Sarah) manipulates Dan. It is revealed that the true reason Serena left the Upper East Side was because she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. However, the incident is finally resolved and Georgina leaves. However, Dan and Serena's relationship is in ruins and the two decide to break it off. Meanwhile, Lilly accepts her proposal from Bart Bass, despite her ever-present feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.|$|E

2500|$|... {{which is}} known as the {{dispersion}} relation for a free particle. Here one must notice that now, since the particle is not entirely free but under the influence of a potential (the potential V described above), the energy of the particle given above {{is not the same thing}} as [...] where p is the momentum of the particle, and thus the wavenumber k above actually describes the energy states of the particle, not the momentum states (i.e. it turns out that the momentum of the particle is not given by [...] ). In this sense, it is quite dangerous to call the number k a wavenumber, since it is not related to momentum like [...] "wavenumber" [...] usually is. The rationale for calling k the wavenumber is that it enumerates the number of crests that the wavefunction has inside the box, and in this sense it is a wavenumber. This discrepancy can be seen more clearly below, when <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the energy spectrum of the particle is discrete (only discrete values of energy are allowed) but the momentum spectrum is continuous (momentum can vary continuously) and in particular, the relation [...] for the energy and momentum of the particle does not hold.

We make our pleasures civic and public as far as possible, and the ideal is inclusive and not exclusive. There are, of course, festivities which all cannot share, but our distribution into small communities favors the possibility of all doing so. Our daily life, however, is so largely social that we seldom meet by special invitation or engagement. When we do, {{it is with the}} perfect understanding that the assemblage confers no social distinction, but is for a momentary convenience. In fact, these occasions are rather avoided, recalling, as they do, the vapid and tedious entertainments of the competitive epoch, the receptions and balls and dinners of a semi-barbaric people striving for social prominence by shutting a certain number in and a certain number out, and overdressing, overfeeding, and overdrinking. Anything premeditated {{in the way of a}} pleasure we think stupid and mistaken; we like to meet suddenly, or on the spur of the moment, out-of-doors, if possible, and arrange a picnic or a dance or a play; and let people come and go without ceremony. No one is more host than guest; all are hosts and guests.

60|$|THERE is a {{difference}} between one and another hour of life in their authority and subsequent effect. Our faith comes in moments; our vice is habitual. Yet there is a depth in those brief moments which constrains us to ascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences. For this reason the argument which is always forthcoming to silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes of man, namely the appeal to experience, is for ever invalid and vain. We give up the past to the objector, and yet we hope. He must explain this hope. We grant that human life is mean, but how did <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it was mean? What is the ground of this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What is the universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim? Why do men feel that the natural history of man has never been written, but he is always leaving behind what you have said of him, and it becomes old, and books of metaphysics worthless? The philosophy of six thousand years has not searched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its experiments there has always remained, in the last analysis, a residuum it could not resolve. Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is descending into us from we know not whence. The most exact calculator has no prescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next moment. I am constrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin for events than the will I call mine.|$|E
