5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be understood.|$|E

He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E
5|$|Vang Pao {{himself was}} not {{blind to the}} realities facing his people. He had {{threatened}} to launch a mass migration of the Hmong to Thailand on three previous occasions. In November 1969, he tried a different tack, contacting the Pathet Lao and attempted to negotiate a quid pro quo: the Hmong would cease fighting if the communists <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> establish a semiautonomous state in Xieng Khouang Province.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E

Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees {{a drop of blood}} on the floor grow into a large puddle.

5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners {{and told them that}} if they would promise to go home and not return to arms, he <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|In Rochefort, an {{expedition}} was planned to carry {{supplies to the}} French West Indies while the British were distracted by Willaumez's operations. Assigned to the operation was Commodore Eleonore-Jean-Nicolas Soleil, an officer who had served on Allemand's expedition, a successful operation the year before. To carry the supplies and reinforcements, Soleil was provided with seven ships: Four large modern frigates rated at 40-guns but actually carrying 44–46, a smaller and older frigate of 36 guns and two small corvettes of 16 guns each. All of the ships were heavily laden, each carrying as many as 650 men, but {{it was hoped that}} their size and speed <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defeat anything smaller than they were and to escape anything larger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E

5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision {{would be based on}} financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May 2005, Red Football {{announced}} that it had reached an agreement with shareholders J. P. McManus and John Magnier to purchase Cubic Expression's 28.7% stake in the club, which gave the Glazers a controlling stake with just under 57% of the club's shares. They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the Glazers had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> end the club's public limited company (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange. On 16 May, the Glazers took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75.7%, and a month later, on 22 June, they removed the club's shares from the stock exchange {{for the first time}} in 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of the Mary Rose and her {{contents}} was {{an essential}} part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that the object was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common pond snails that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot was}} first {{broadcast}} on Monday 13 May 2002, during the 9 to 10 pm time slot. The Spooks producers were hoping the {{ratings for the}} pilot would achieve at least six million viewers, with a 30 per cent audience share; at the time this would be considered acceptable ratings by the BBC, as it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> further consider Spooks future. The episode ended up with an overnight rating of 9.2 million viewers, with a 41 per cent audience share, easily winning its time slot, and nearly doubling the numbers of ITV1's Helen West, which was viewed by 4.8 million with 22 per cent share in the same slot. The final numbers posted on the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board website was up slightly to 9.6 million viewers, making the Spooks pilot the seventh most viewed BBC One broadcast, and the tenth most viewed broadcast in total the week it aired.|$|E
