2500|$|In 1954 Buick Roadmaster and Super {{shared with}} Cadillac and Oldsmobile 98 the new General Motors C-body, {{adopting}} the new [...] "ponton" [...] appearance, {{and the addition}} of [...] "Dagmar bumpers" [...] to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229mm) [...] longer overall than in 1953. Roadmaster script was found on the rear quarters and within the deck ornament. Rear fenders had a blunted fin at the rear edge, with dual [...] "bullet" [...] taillamps below. A new panoramic <b>windshield</b> with vertical <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> was used. Seats had chrome bands on 2-door models and rear seats had an armrest on 4-door models. The front suspension was refined and Roadmaster's horsepower was increased to 200. The pillared coupe and the Estate wagon were no longer offered as body styles. Overall sales dropped to 50,600.|$|R
5000|$|The {{greenhouse}} (or glasshouse) {{of a car}} {{comprises the}} <b>windshield,</b> rear and <b>side</b> windows, the <b>pillars</b> separating them (designated A-pillar, B-pillar and so on, starting from the car's front), and the car's roof.|$|R
50|$|The filler {{materials}} {{were made of}} either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers). These {{materials were}} used around {{the leading edge of}} the nose cap, <b>windshields,</b> <b>side</b> hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, vertical stabilizer, the rudder/speed brake, body flap, and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines.|$|R
5000|$|A boost gauge is a {{pressure}} gauge that indicates manifold air pressure or turbocharger or supercharger boost pressure [...] in an internal combustion engine. They are commonly {{mounted on the}} dashboard, on the driver's <b>side</b> <b>pillar,</b> or in a radio slot.|$|R
5000|$|Fixed-profile: In {{contrast}} to convertibles where the entire bodywork above the beltline (doors, roof, <b>side</b> <b>pillars,</b> <b>side</b> bodywork) is {{replaced with a}} folding or retractable roof, the fixed profile convertible retain portions of fixed bodywork including the doors, <b>side</b> <b>pillars,</b> and <b>side</b> elements of the roof [...] - [...] while a center fabric portion slides back and accordions at the rear. As an example, Citroën's 1948 Citroën 2CV featured rigid bodysides and two doors on each side, along with a sunroof that rolled back on itself and extended to the rear bumper {{in place of a}} separate boot/trunk lid. Other fixed-profile convertibles include the 1950 Nash Rambler Landau Convertible Coupe, the Nissan Figaro (1991), and the 1957 Fiat 500 and its 2007 Fiat 500 successor. The 1984 Heuliez-designed Citroen Visa Decapotable used elements of a fixed-profile convertible.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the locomotive controls, a cab will typically be fitted with <b>windshields,</b> rectangular <b>side</b> windows, crew seats, heating, and sometimes radios, air conditioning and toilets.|$|R
50|$|The {{panel is}} {{intermediate}} between a medieval polyptych and a Renaissance altarpiece. It is generally {{described as the}} first work in which the subject has a direct relationship with the surrounding architecture. Another innovation is the small <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> with saints, later used also by Masaccio and Fra Angelico.|$|R
50|$|During {{reconstruction}} work in 1760-80, the choir, vestry and tower {{were added to}} the original building. In middle of nineteenth century the Baltic-German noblemen of Padise (then Padis) and Leetse manors wanted to celebrate the coronation of the new czar, Alexander II, so the tower was built even higher and supported by <b>side</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{fabrication}} of an optical MEMS device on InP platform. The device {{is based on a}} suspended parallel waveguide configuration with <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> supports. Electrodes are integrated on the device layer to provide MEMS actuation functionality to the waveguides. The device is designed to be used as an optical buffer for telecommunication applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{door was}} always {{out of the}} “Tramuntana” and “Poniente”, is usually a simple threshold, a fine stone resting {{of the side of}} the door.Also have used the two {{segments}} arch, to inclined thresholds, at an angle on the <b>side</b> <b>pillar,</b> in “Barracas”, as they say in Benaguasil. Also can find the arch with elongated stones positioned radially.|$|R
50|$|The Tan Teck Guan Building has a Georgian {{architectural}} façade with neo-classic details. Its {{main entrance}} is embellished with an ornate archway supported by Doric columns, with Ionic columns {{on the upper}} level. The work of Tan Jiak Kim for setting up Singapore's first medical school is remembered on two historical plaques on the <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> of the main entrance to the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{work had}} a predella, {{now at the}} National Gallery, London and portraying Adoration of Saints, Prophets and Members of the Dominican Order. The latter also houses a tondo with St. Romulus, perhaps located above the polyptych.

5000|$|Prior to [...] "pimping", the van {{had a large}} {{bullet hole}} through the passenger's <b>side</b> <b>windshield.</b>|$|R
5000|$|New Jersey prohibits {{windshield}} obstructions under 39:3-74 : [...] "No person shall drive any {{motor vehicle}} with any sign, poster, sticker or other non-transparent material upon the front <b>windshield,</b> wings, deflectors, <b>side</b> shields, corner lights adjoining <b>windshield</b> or front <b>side</b> windows of such vehicle {{other than a}} certificate or other article required to be so displayed by statute or by regulations of the commissioner.|$|R
50|$|RISE is a {{monocoque}} body system that combines an energy-absorbing {{front and rear}} section with a strong, rigid occupant cell to provide protection {{in the event of}} an accident. It features high tensile steel reinforcing bars in doors and energy-absorbing material in the <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> and roof rails. The body structure is based on a one-piece shell with high levels of bending and torsional rigidity, which provides a steel cage for the safety of both the driver and passengers.|$|R
50|$|The Westfield XTR2 is an ultralightweight, {{two-seater}} {{sports car}} manufactured by Westfield Sportscars Limited, of West Midlands, UK. It features a lightweight steel tubular spaceframe chassis, and the , 1299 cc Suzuki Hayabusa 4-cylinder engine, mated to a 6-speed sequential gearbox. Performance upgrades are available. However, it lacks a <b>windshield,</b> <b>side</b> doors, roof, and is virtually devoid of interior luxury. As {{a result of}} this simplicity, the car only weighs between 410-440 kilograms, depending on configuration. By achieving an extremely high power-to-weight ratio, it has been intended primarily as a car to be used on the race track. However, it is still legal for road use (at least in the UK). The Westfield XTR2 {{is a member of the}} Bike Engined Car (BEC) class of vehicle that are becoming very popular at Track Days.|$|R
2500|$|The {{white marble}} mosque of Bhodesar is {{built in a}} style that was highly {{influenced}} by the architecture of nearby Jain temples. The mosque was built in 1505 CE by the Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat. The mosque features a central dome very similar to domes found on the nearby Jain temples, [...] resting upon a square shaped edifice measuring 9.2 metres on each <b>side.</b> <b>Pillars</b> at the mosque also reflect Jain architecture, while decorative elements along the roofline were also inspired by Jain temples.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the system}} of Lataif-e-sitta, there is a Lataif known as Khafi, or arcane subtlety, in the same position. This {{is thought to be}} related to mystical intuition. According to the Kabbalah, there are two sephirot located on the sixth level, {{associated}} with the left and right parts of the face. They are called Chokmah (wisdom) and Binah (understanding); it is at these points that the two <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> of mercy and severity end, while the central pillar carries on rising to kether, the crown.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1970s {{they became}} a very common design element. “...The hottest thing going was the [...] "porthole" [...] window in the rear <b>side</b> <b>pillar</b> - called [...] "opera windows" [...] that came in during the horse and buggy ... Most often, they were applied on two-door hardtop or coupé models and in all types of vehicles, from economy {{compacts}} to luxury brands. They also “were recognition elements” in the specialty, personal-sized car market. Practically all cars in the personal luxury market offered these windows {{as part of their}} seemingly vintage-oriented styling.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is {{preceded by a}} portico with a triangular pediment supported by two columns with Corinthian capitals and <b>side</b> <b>pillars.</b> Within the pediment is the coat of arms of Pope Pius XI; There are also two side entrances that open into two bodies of curvilinear factory, placed {{at the side of}} the porch.

5000|$|The {{sculptor}} Jean Cévaer and {{the carpenter}} Jeané Le Seven combined {{to produce the}} [...] "Rosary" [...] altarpiece in 1696/98 and at a later stage the painter Olivier Grall added paintings. In the centre-piece the Virgin Mary is depicted handing the rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Sienna. Statues of Saint Luke and Saint John are positioned {{at the bottom of}} each of the <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> and at the very top is a depiction of the Holy Father. A series of medallions spaced around the central tableau depict episodes from Jesus' life.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of the sacristy door at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, Monterey, ca. 1908. The {{wooden door}} {{sits in a}} doorway {{consisting}} of two <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> and an arched top (cracked). There is a round decoration {{in the center of}} the door. Above the door, there is framed painting of religious figure. A small bench sits to the left to the door. A small bell sits on the bench. A rope, extending up (to a chandelier?) is tied at the wall over the bench. Another piece of furniture sits at right. Part of a rug is visible at bottom...|$|R
50|$|They are {{installed}} approximately every 8 km. There are about 5000 throughout Japan, and the pillars are 15 cm on a <b>side.</b> Each <b>pillar</b> is anchored {{with a very}} large perpendicular rock buried underground.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 {{the engine}} was changed to a [...] Riedel/Imme engine. By 1951, in {{response}} to customer requests for passenger-carrying capability, a scooter-type saddle was placed above the rear enclosure with footrests {{on either side of}} the body. A closed version, on which the hatch had an enclosure that covered the operator, was made available. The enclosure included the <b>windshield</b> and <b>side</b> windows.|$|R
50|$|The monumental main {{staircase}} (Főlépcsőház), {{with three}} flights, led {{up from the}} lobby {{to the first floor}} in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal Atlas statues stood beside the <b>side</b> <b>pillars,</b> holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of János Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Groupe PSA {{created a}} new brand - DS Automobiles, {{intended}} as high quality, high specification variations on existing models, with differing mechanics and bodywork. This brand ranges across four models, the DS3, DS4, DS5, and the China-only SUV DS 6. The DS3, launched in March 2010, is based on Citroën's new C3, but is more customisable and unique, bearing some resemblance to the original DS, with its [...] "Shark Fin" [...] <b>side</b> <b>pillar.</b> These have created their own niches, with the DS4 being a mix of a crossover and a coupe and the DS5 mixing a coupe and an estate. Many feature hybrid-diesel engines to maximise efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|The Chrysler CCV {{featured}} an injection-molded {{plastic body}} with a fabric roof and an air-cooled 2-cylinder engine driving the front wheels. It {{was designed to be}} cheap and easy to manufacture in countries with poor transportation and utilities infrastructure and minimal access to capital and skilled labor. The car's simplicity would have ensured longevity and reliability in harsh conditions, and made it easy for owners to do their own maintenance and repair work. Despite its lightweight construction, the CCV performed well in front and rear crash tests, although its lack of structural support in the doors and <b>side</b> <b>pillars</b> would have prevented sales in first world markets.|$|R
50|$|The cabin {{features}} a club-seating arrangement, a toilet (or a possible seventh seat), and a baggage compartment in the pressurized area. In the cockpit, <b>side</b> window <b>pillars</b> are eliminated {{for a more}} unobstructed view for the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|Typical {{driving cab}} features, and {{therefore}} A unit features, include <b>windshields,</b> rectangular <b>side</b> windows, crew seats, heating, and sometimes, radios, {{air conditioning and}} toilets. B units always lack all of these features, except that some EMD F-units have an extra porthole-style side window(s) for a hostler (an employee permitted to move a locomotive in a yard only [...] - [...] not on the road).|$|R
