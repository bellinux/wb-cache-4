On October 9, 2012, a sneak peek of the video was posted on the singer's official Vevo channel on YouTube. Subsequently, via his official Twitter account, he tweeted: [...] "Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> moments {{that allow us to}} make it thru, ability to just wakeup every morning a breath", together with the link from the sneak peek. The sneak peek features Usher dancing in a glass box as different personal scenes including shots of his sons and footage from various concerts are projected towards the background. The full music video premiered on his Vevo channel October 11, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E

It's beautifully written…and acted, but it's not especially neatly tailored… At the center of the movie and giving it a visible sensibility is Miss Burstyn, one of the few actresses at work today…who is able to seem appealing, tough, intelligent, funny, and bereft, all at approximately the same moment. It's Miss Burstyn's movie and part of the enjoyment of the film is in the director's apparent awareness of this fact… Two other performances must be noted, those of Diane Ladd and Valerie Curtin… Their marvelous contributions in small roles are a measure of the film's quality and of Mr. Scorsese's fully realized talents {{as one of the best}} of the new American film-makers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{plays of}} Euripides, {{like those of}} Aeschylus and Sophocles, were {{circulated}} in written form in the 5th century among literary {{members of the audience}} and performers at minor festivals, as aide-memoirs. However, literary conventions that <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> today had not yet been inventedthere was no spacing between words, no consistency in punctuation nor in vowel elisions, no marks for breathings and accent (guides to pronunciation and hence word recognition), no convention to denote change of speaker and no stage directions, and verse was written straight across the page like prose. Possibly those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as the equivalent of the modern dash, colon and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions, which are an aid to comprehension, was an early and persistent source of errors affecting transmission of the text. Errors crept in also when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403–402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens in 330 BC [...] "...that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal." [...] The law was soon disregarded and some actors continued to make their own changes up until about 200 BC, after which the habit dies out. It was about then that Aristophanes of Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was [...] "published" [...] separately. This became the [...] "standard edition" [...] for the future and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expectthere was still no spacing between words, little or no punctuation and no stage directions, but abbreviated names now denoted changes of speaker, lyrics are broken into [...] "cola' and [...] "strophai" [...] or lines and stanzas, and a system of accentuation was introduced.|$|E

6000|$|In the {{critical}} remarks, therefore, prefixed and annexed to the Lyrical Ballads, I believe, we may safely rest, {{as the true}} origin of the unexampled opposition which Mr. Wordsworth's writings have been since doomed to encounter. The humbler passages in the poems themselves were dwelt on and cited to justify {{the rejection of the}} theory. What in and for themselves would have been either forgotten or forgiven as imperfections, or at least comparative failures, provoked direct hostility when announced as intentional, as the result of choice after full deliberation. Thus the poems, admitted by all as excellent, joined with those which had pleased the far greater number, though they formed two-thirds of the whole work, instead of being deemed (as in all right they should have been, even if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that the reader judged aright) an atonement for the few exceptions, gave wind and fuel to the animosity against both the poems and the poet. In all perplexity there is a portion of fear, which predisposes the mind to anger. Not able to deny that the author possessed both genius and a powerful intellect, they felt very positive,--but yet were not quite certain that he might not be in the right, and they themselves in the wrong; an unquiet state of mind, which seeks alleviation by quarrelling with the occasion of it, and by wondering at the perverseness of the man, who had written a long and argumentative essay to persuade them, that ...|$|E

6000|$|To {{return to}} the argument. Let us {{consider}} next what wages the monopolist in the cases described above will have to pay. <b>We</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that he will only {{pay as much as}} he has to. How much will this be? Clearly enough it will depend altogether on the number of available working men capable of doing the work in question and the situation in which they find themselves. It is again a case of relative [...] "economic strength." [...] The situation may be altogether in favor of the employer or altogether in favor of the men, or may occupy a middle ground. If the men are so numerous that there are more of them than are needed for the work, and if there is no other occupation for them they must accept a starvation wage. If they are so few in number that they can all be employed, and if they are so well organized as to act together, they can in their turn exact any wage up to the point that leaves no profit for the employer himself at all. Indeed for a short time wages might even pass this point, the monopolist employer being willing (for various reasons, all quite obvious) actually to pay more as wages than he gets as return and to carry on business at a loss for the sake of carrying it on at all. Clearly, then, wages, as Adam Smith said, [...] "are the result of a dispute" [...] in which either party must be pushed to the wall. The employer may have to pay so much that there is nothing or practically nothing left for himself, or so little that his workmen can just exist and no more. These are the upward and downward limits of the wages in the cases described.|$|E
