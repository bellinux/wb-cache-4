500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. We felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much better. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E

On 10 August, Benfica beat Anderlecht 1–0 after Zlatko Zahovič scored in the 13th minute. When asked why Anderlecht had more goal opportunities than Benfica, Trapattoni said, [...] "Do you know international football? It is very balanced nowadays. I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> chances but our opponent was stronger." [...] Following the win, Benfica were due to meet Porto in the Supercup on 20 August. Ricardo Quaresma of Porto scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an individual effort. It was Benfica's tenth consencutive loss in the competition; the previous win occurred in 1989. Four days later, Benfica travelled to Belgium to play Anderlecht. The home team scored first by Aruna Dindane, who scored another on the hour-mark. Nenad Jestrović scored the last goal. Trapattoni blamed fatigue and anxiety for the defeat, saying, [...] "I said we would try to score, but lacked composure to do so. In the first half {{he spent a lot of}} energy. On the second, we tried to fight back, until he conceded a second goal, which killed us." [...] The fans insulted the team on their arrival in Lisbon. On 29 August, Benfica made their debut in the Primeira Liga by visiting Beira-Mar. Two goals in the first half and another within five minutes of the second, gave Benfica a lead that help them beat the locals.|$|E
500|$|Development on Mega Man 3 {{began at}} Capcom {{over a year}} after the release of Mega Man 2. Akira Kitamura, the lead {{supervisor}} for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", considered Mega Man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to [...] " [...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game." [...] He had [...] "preset notions" [...] about successful development because of the team's good experience with Mega Man 2 and found that his new superior [...] "didn't really understand Mega Man the way his predecessor did". During the game's production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put Mega Man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready. Inafune concluded, [...] "I knew that if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time to polish it, we could {{do a lot of things}} better, make it a better game, but the company said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{has written}} nearly thirty books, {{some of which}} are {{mentioned}} here. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times bestseller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, [...] "I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> than enough to fill a book." [...] Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 2005.|$|E

On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. That {{may sound like a}} contradiction but that is the case. I think <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge.

[...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done {{a lot of things in}} my career, had a lot of fun, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything.
