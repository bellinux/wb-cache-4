5|$|On November 28, 2009, {{two doors}} fell off from an AirTrain {{that had just}} been maintained. Since the {{incident}} happened in the overnight hours, no one was aboard the train <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> fell off.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the gas chambers had been opened, {{the bodies of the}} dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E

They can only be touched from outside <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> has been opened, and therefore, if the locks on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> are compromised, a door chain may cause some delay, draw more attention, or leave more {{evidence}} of force being used when gaining unauthorized access to the structure.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{conflicting}} political, {{religious and}} social positions, the English Civil War was fought between {{the supporters of}} Parliament and those of King Charles I, known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed. After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament {{and could not be}} suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the House of Commons are slammed {{in the face of the}} monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

25|$|On 19 November 1921, about 100 Moplah {{prisoners were}} sent by train from Malabar to Coimbatore. They were packed in goods wagons which, of course, had no ventilation. So, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were opened after a five hours’ journey, {{the prisoners were}} found to be in a state of collapse, with horrible wounds inflicted by bites and bows in one another by the {{struggling}} men. In all, 82 men died.|$|E
25|$|On systems {{where the}} floor {{level of the}} vehicle and the {{platform}} height closely match, an extendible step can be installed below {{the doors of the}} vehicle that deploy <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are unlocked. This significantly decreases the gap and thus the risks, while at the most vulnerable situation, boarding and alighting of vehicles at stations or stops. This method is used by the German BR423 EMU's and its derivatives, including the Dutch variant SLT.|$|E
25|$|Ray Manzarek {{played the}} song's bass line {{with his left}} hand on a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while {{performing}} the other keyboard parts on a Vox Continental using his right hand. After the recording session, producer Paul A. Rothchild brought in session musician Larry Knechtel to overdub a Fender Precision Bass guitar to double the keyboard bass line. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> played the song at live concerts, Manzarek used the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass without augmentation.|$|E

25|$|The {{announcement}} {{made through}} the {{public address system}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are closing, Ukončete, prosím, výstup a nástup, dveře se zavírají ("Please finish exiting and boarding, the doors are closing") {{has become a symbol}} of Prague for many tourists, and is possibly the first clear Czech phrase many travelers hear. The announcement has been similar since 1974, when the first line of metro was opened. The announcements voiced on line B: Eva Jurinová, on line A: Světlana Lavičková and on line C: Tomáš Černý.|$|E
25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of containerization. The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.|$|E
25|$|All {{passenger}} cars were air conditioned. The passages between {{the cars were}} wide and without doors, the seat pitch of 102 (second class) and 111cm (first class) was larger than on any other German train. Furthermore, the doors were unusually wide and featured steps that deployed automatically <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were opened to make entry as convenient as possible, and the glass doors dividing the two major areas of the intermediate cars were opened by proximity sensors. The ICE1 was the first German train in which smokers and non-smokers were separated not into {{different parts of the}} same car, but to different cars altogether.|$|E

25|$|After {{flashing}} over in {{the ballroom}} (which witnesses confused with an explosion), the super-heated gases swept up the grand staircase into {{the lobby of the}} hotel. From there, the fire was drawn through the open doors of the casino by the smoke-eaters (devices in the ceiling that sucked the smoke from cigarettes out of the room) present throughout the casino. With more than 150 guests estimated to be in the casino when the fire broke out, most of the deaths occurred in that area. Several months before the fire, hotel management had had the emergency exit doors locked to prevent theft, and the only other way out was through a pair of inward-opening doors. Some people pressed against the doors to no avail. Others leaped from the second-story casino through plate-glass windows to the pool deck below; many were injured. Others died of smoke inhalation on upper floors of the casino. Still others were killed as they rode the elevators to the lobby, only to discover their path blocked by the fire <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> opened. Those who were able to do so climbed to the hotel's roof, where an improvised helicopter rescue, including civilian, Commonwealth Police, Puerto Rico National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy helicopters from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, transported people to safety.|$|E
500|$|Tulsidas came to Varanasi and {{recited the}} Ramcharitmanas to Shiva (Vishwanath) and Parvati (Annapurna) at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. A popular legend goes that the Brahmins of Varanasi, who were {{critical}} of Tulsidas for having rendered the Sanskrit Ramayana in the Awadhi, decided {{to test the}} worth of the work. A manuscript of the Ramcharitmanas was kept {{at the bottom of}} pile of Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vishvanath temple in the night, and the doors of the sanctum sanctorum were locked. In the morning <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were opened, the Ramcharitmanas was found {{at the top of the}} pile. The words Satyam Shivam Sundaram (Sanskrit: सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्, literally [...] "truth, auspiciousness, beauty") were inscribed on the manuscript with the signature of Shiva. The words were also heard by the people present.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of a year, Van Alen {{painstakingly}} designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, {{who was in charge of}} developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts. The cabs were manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company, while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. Each elevator was built with dimensions of [...] The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are closed, they resemble [...] "tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies" [...] from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles [...] "an exquisite Art Deco room". These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} of [...] "The Power of Three" [...] {{took place}} at Roath Lock, Cardiff on 27 April 2012. It was filmed by itself in the series' third production block. Because of this schedule, it was the final episode Gillan and Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory. Their last scene filmed together was getting into the TARDIS with the Doctor after saying farwell to Brian; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> closed Gillan, Darvill, and Smith hugged and started crying. Some exterior scenes at Amy and Rory's house were re-shot in June and July 2012, with Darvill briefly returning for the June re-shoot. Producer Marcus Wilson stated that a [...] "hundred" [...] individual cube props were made, with [...] "many more" [...] added with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Amy and the Doctor's conversation outside the Tower of London could not be filmed at the genuine location due to the London Olympics, so it was shot on studio in Cardiff and the live action was combined with other footage to create the illusion. The episode also features cameos from physicist Brian Cox and Lord Sugar, {{both of whom were}} long-time fans of the program. Sugar's cameo was in fact filmed on the set of The Apprentice, with director Douglas Mackinnon standing in for the person who was fired.|$|E
