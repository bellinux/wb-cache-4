5|$|Juan {{requested}} {{to be transferred}} to Spain, leaving the Americas in 1783. The family settled in Madrid, but as Juan was unable to earn a promotion, they moved to Málaga. Once in the city, San Martín enrolled in Málaga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785.

5|$|Washington {{had been}} {{authorized}} by Congress to recruit {{an army of}} up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain {{of a large number}} of people from different environments and temperaments in relative closeness.|$|E
5|$|When Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, {{was hiding}} from the Nazis in the Kraków Ghetto in 1942, he {{accepted}} a kvitel {{from one of}} the men who was assigned to protect him. As the names of the man's children were read aloud, the Rebbe continually stopped the reader <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> a certain child's name and asked him to begin reading the kvitel again. This happened several times. Later the man learned that this son had died suddenly during the war, but the rest of his family survived.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|During the 1881 season, Sainsbury {{was joined}} at Somerset by {{his older brother}} Francis, who {{appeared}} four times for the county. Sainsbury performed consistently with the bat during the season, regularly scoring between 20 and 40runs in an innings. His highest score was made against Gloucestershire, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> his only half-century of the season, scoring 56 while batting at number seven. Sainsbury bowled less frequently during 1881, and rarely opened the bowling for Somerset. His best bowling performance of the season for his county came against Hampshire, when– having not bowled in the first innings– he claimed four wickets as Hampshire followed on. On this occasion he was the fifth bowler used by Somerset, but he bowled {{the highest number of}} overs.|$|E

Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E

Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the attempt to relieve Wake Island, and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.|$|E

The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The Flames re-signed Conroy {{to a new}} {{contract}} prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain.
