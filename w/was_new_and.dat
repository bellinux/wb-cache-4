The school <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.

The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition. Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association, inducted into the Order of the Coif, and graduated third in his class in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{played as}} a left-arm fast bowler {{when the ball}} <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> conducive to pace bowling, before {{reverting}} to finger spin when it became old and lost its shine. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball pairing of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace duos of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short and sharp new ball bursts against the local batsmen. England had agreed that a new ball would be available every 55 overs, a milestone that usually came more frequently than the old regulation of 200 runs for every ball. This allowed Australiawho had the superior pace attackmore frequent use of a shiny ball, which swung at high pace. Johnston typically bowled pace after the first-choice pair had finished their new ball spell, before reverting to spin when the ball was worn. He took 27 wickets at 23.33 in the Tests, making him the equal-leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall, who averaged 19.62. The Australian pacemen’s tally was substantially more than the next best, recorded by England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22.|$|E

5|$|Johnston was a left-arm bowler {{who engaged}} in fast bowling when the ball <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> conducive to pacemen, before {{reverting}} to orthodox spin when the ball became old. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball attack of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace pairings of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short bursts against the English batsmen with the new ball. The hosts had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than usual. This allowed the Australian pacemen more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings. In order to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh, Bradman had Johnston deliver the most overs by any bowler.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 <b>was</b> <b>new,</b> <b>and</b> the second provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly {{funded by a}} £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E

The Madchester {{movement}} burgeoned, its sound <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> refreshing and its popularity soon grew.

25|$|Just as the {{development}} of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption {{of any kind of}} data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{stayed with}} de Gribaldy for 1977 and 1978. Then in 1978 Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the Tour de France after {{cheating}} a drugs test {{on the afternoon}} that he took the race lead. He left the team {{at the end of}} the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. But Splendor <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state– enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris–Roubaix– and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself. The writer Robin Magowan said: Some people can do business on the committee system; others find that life is only fun when you are running the show. In Kelly's case it was to mean working for the collection of underpaid has-beens that de Gribaldy habitually assembled. But a smaller, less pretentious team can have its advantages for a rider of Kelly's sort. When you don't have to compete for a team's loyalty you can concentrate on winning races, and that's exactly what Kelly proceeded to do.|$|E

25|$|Racoon {{captured}} another privateer on 20 October, but it sank {{shortly after}} capture. Racoon {{was about three}} leagues NW by W of Blackness at 6 a.m. {{in the morning when}} she sighted three luggers ahead. She immediately sailed towards them and after a two-hour running fight was able to capture one. The captive was the Vigilante, of twelve 4-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of some 50 men on board, all under the command of Citizen Muirbassse. When the prize crew went on board Vigilante they found that he was taking on water rapidly due to shot holes in her hull. Racoon tried to stop the leaks, which took up so much time that the other two privateers were able to make their escape. Lloyd was able to get all his prisoners aboard Racoon, leaving only the dead behind, and watched Valiante sink at 9 a.m. Valiante <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> had been out only once before and had not captured anything. One of the luggers that escaped had taken a prize that another British warship recaptured two hours later.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{disagreed}} on the originality of the musicwhile Seward {{claimed that}} it <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> inventive, Murat Batmaz, of Maelstrom, {{said that it}} was very typical funeral doom metal. Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars, and the lack of speed in the music, combined with the monotony of the sound. Seward felt that the album [...] "is not 'heavy' music in the least, if we’re talking volume and crunch", but that [...] "it is 'heavy' music if we’re talking about the end product: a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that is compelling in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor".|$|E
500|$|The {{second phase}} of {{building}} work undertaken by the Hospitallers {{began in the early}} 13thcentury and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing [...] high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design <b>was</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Château Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s a postern was added to the north wall.|$|E

[...] A similar study, also conducted in 2000 by many of the same researchers, found that experienced Blue's Clues viewers interacted more with other educational programs than did inexperienced viewers, which proved that watching Blue's Clues changed the way children watch television. Researcher Shalom M. Fisch, however, stated that although the show attempted to be [...] "participatory," [...] it could not truly be so, because unlike interactive computer games, the viewers' responses could not change or influence what occurred on-screen.|$|E
