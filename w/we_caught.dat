2500|$|After {{several days}} of routine duties, on 4 August 1944 the crew found German human torpedo with a damaged rudder and pilot dead. [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "The Germans used to have these one-man subs and <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> one but didn’t take it aboard, we {{turned it over to}} an English ship." ...|$|E
2500|$|But as we stood, {{one of the}} porters behind {{called out}} [...] "Simba"; and <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> {{a glimpse of a}} big lioness {{galloping}} down beside the trees, just beyond the donga … Tarlton took his big double-barrel and advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set and it was likely to be close work; but I shook my head, for the Winchester 405 is, at least for me personally, the [...] "medicine gun" [...] for lions.|$|E
2500|$|After {{they agreed}} to support Dodd for auditor, either Earl or Blanche Long, or both, enticed Douglas Fowler, a local {{politician}} from Coushatta, the seat of Red River Parish, to enter the race. At first, Earl Long let Fowler speak on the platform, but Dodd said that [...] "the public felt that I was the real Long candidate, and Fowler finally quit making our meetings. Miss Blanche threw {{me a couple of}} curves, including the printing up of some Earl Long ticket sample ballots with my number beside Fowler's name. But <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> her trick and corrected it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{council of}} Moriori elders was convened at the {{settlement}} called Te Awapatiki. Despite knowing of the Māori predilection for killing and eating the conquered, {{and despite the}} admonition {{by some of the}} elder chiefs that the principle of Nunuku was not appropriate now, two chiefs—Tapata and Torea—declared that [...] "the law of Nunuku was not a strategy for survival, to be varied as conditions changed; it was a moral imperative." [...] A Moriori survivor recalled: [...] " [...] commenced to kill us like sheep.... were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed – men, women and children indiscriminately." [...] A Māori conqueror explained, [...] "We took possession... in accordance with our customs and <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> all the people. Not one escaped..." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{practices}} increased after U.S. troops left Iraq. When {{the government}} announced an arrest warrant against former deputy prime minister Tariq al-Hashimi, who had fled to the Kurdish-controlled regions of the country, it broadcast the confessions of three of his bodyguards to support charges that he had ordered the assassinations of rivals. This, and the other public displays of accused criminals, was criticized by foreign observers and some Iraqi officials. [...] "It is a crime to put this on television" [...] {{said one of the}} latter. [...] "It is a shame, and it is a legacy of the former dictator." [...] Security officials responded that they were trying to assure the Iraqi public that they were actively working to protect them and apprehend terrorists. [...] "If we say <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> the leader of Al Qaeda, who will believe it?" [...] said an Interior Ministry official. [...] "This is to show credibility. We are sure we are doing the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama in turn saw {{the meeting}} as a {{precursor}} to warfare {{on the part of}} Moriori and responded. The Māori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: [...] " [...] commenced to kill us like sheep... were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed — men, women and children — indiscriminately." [...] A Māori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said: [...] "We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed — but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom." [...] Despite the Chatham Islands being made part of New Zealand in 1842, Māori kept Moriori slaves until 1863 ...|$|E

6000|$|One of {{them said}} to the others, 'If <b>we</b> are <b>caught,</b> <b>we</b> shall be hanged on the gallows; how shall we set about it?'

2500|$|Similarly, {{early twentieth-century}} naturalists were skeptical that California Golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) were extant {{in the coastal}} streams of the Bay Area. However, the Russian-American Company's Ivan Kuskov sailed into Bodega Bay in 1809 on the Kodiak and, after {{exploring}} 50 miles of the Russian River, returned to Novo Arkhangelsk, Alaska (Sitka), with beaver skins and over 2,000 sea otter (Enhydra lutris) pelts. The Russians' stated reason for establishing a settlement in Alta California was, [...] "The rich, fertile soil [...] the abundance of seal, otter and beaver were the principal factors which favored this colonization." [...] An 1816 report by the Russian-American Company's Board of Directors {{said that it was}} establishing a settlement to introduce agriculture.(page 33, After December 16, 1813: A report to Emperor Alexander I from the Russian American Company Council, concerning trade with California and the establishment of Fort Ross) Before establishing a southern colony at Fort Ross, the Russian-American Company contracted with American ships beginning in 1806, providing them with Aleuts and their baidarkas (kayaks) to hunt otter on the coast of Spanish California. Hudson's Bay Company's Alexander R. McLeod reported in 1829, [...] "The Country to the northward of Bodega is said to be rich in Beaver and no encouragement given to the Indians to hunt." [...] The fur trapper Ewing Young, led an expedition up Putah Creek to Clear Lake and on to the Mendocino County Coast in March, 1833. James Weeks, a member of Young's 1833 fur brigade wrote: [...] "They broke up all the beaver lodges on the lake, I believe the finest and largest beaver <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> there, we arrived at the Russian River and pitched camp sent out, trappers found signs set traps caught beavers..." [...] This historical observer record is consistent with the Southern Pomo, who inhabited {{the lower half of the}} Russian River, having a word for beaver ṱ’ek:e and beavers in their [...] "Coyote Stories". In 1881 the Sacramento Daily Union newspaper reported, [...] "Beavers are being trapped near Healdsburg" [...] (placing them again on the Russian River).|$|E
