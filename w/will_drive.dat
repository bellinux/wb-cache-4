5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|Littlest Pet Shop is a Canadian–American children's {{animated}} {{television series}} developed by Julie McNally-Cahill and Tim Cahill for Hasbro Studios. Based on the Littlest Pet Shop and Blythe toys owned by Hasbro, the show follows Blythe Baxter, {{a teenage girl}} who, after moving into an apartment in a metropolitan area, gains {{the ability to communicate}} with animals. Located below her apartment is the eponymous pet store where Blythe works and talks to a group of pets who regularly reside at a day care in the shop. Worried that a corrupt rival business <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> their shop out of business, the pets depend on Blythe to drive business into the store with her pet fashion designs.|$|E

Together, he and Mr. <b>Will</b> <b>drive</b> out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E

5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E

25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass {{electronic}} filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where angular frequency nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator.|$|E

25|$|But {{from the}} fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence gets ideally beyond it, it does not by any means follow that it has really {{overcome}} it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its production moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as constantly posited. Furthermore. The universality towards which it irresistibly strives encounters barriers in its own nature, which will, at a certain stage of its development, allow it to be recognized as being itself the greatest barrier to this tendency, and hence <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> towards its own suspension.|$|E
25|$|In a {{barotropic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient <b>will</b> <b>drive</b> a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|E
