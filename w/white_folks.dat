Here we all work while the <b>white</b> <b>folks</b> play." [...] In the 1966 Lincoln Center production of the show, produced {{two years after the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed. The 1971 London revival used [...] "Here we all work on the Mississippi". The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric, while the Harold Prince revival chose [...] "colored folk".|$|E
500|$|Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League {{education}} differ markedly {{from those}} of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation {{in the civil rights}} movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is [...] "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that [...] "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to <b>white</b> <b>folks</b> then there must be something wrong." [...] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: [...] "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation." ...|$|E

500|$|Show Boat [...] {{begins with}} the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no coon song... {{immediately}} establishes race {{as one of the}} central themes of the play. This is a protest song, more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the <b>white</b> <b>folks</b> and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene.... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know <b>white</b> <b>folks</b> want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ <b>White</b> <b>folks</b> say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

The (983) Taiping Yulan encyclopedia quotes the Bowuzhi and two Shanhaijing chapters. In the west (tr. Birrell 2000: 117), [...] "The Country of <b>White</b> <b>Folk</b> lies {{to the north}} of the land of Dragonfish. The people of <b>White</b> <b>Folk</b> Country have a white body and they wear their hair loose." [...] In the east (tr.

The great god Vast gave birth to the White Folk.", giving a divine genealogical origin myth. The (978) Taiping Guangji collection misquotes the Bowuzhi for the above Shanhaijing myth (tr.

50|$|Conforth {{believes}} that Gellert's large collection, which comprises predominantly blues and devotional songs, {{is of great}} historical importance nevertheless.

A strikingly handsome man, who was, especially when young, very attractive to women, Gellert had originally wanted to become a Broadway actor.|$|R

2500|$|Hughes' first {{collection}} of short stories was published in 1934 with The Ways of <b>White</b> <b>Folks.</b> [...] He finished the book at a Carmel, California cottage provided for a year by Noel Sullivan, another patron. These stories are a series of vignettes revealing the humorous and tragic interactions between whites and blacks. Overall, they are marked by a general pessimism about race relations, as well as a sardonic realism. [...] He also became an advisory board member to the (then) newly formed San Francisco Workers' School (later the California Labor School).|$|E

2500|$|Looking back at {{the film}} in a 2007 review in The Guardian, Andrew Pulver rated it three out of five stars and observed, [...] "Underneath its obvious charms - slinky Dorothy Dandridge, brawny Harry Belafonte {{and a handful of}} memorable numbers {{relocated}} from Bizet's original - the 1954 film version of Oscar Hammerstein's all-black Broadway musical now feels like a relic from the gruesome social straitjacket that was segregation; every frame, you feel, is freighted with the tension imposed by the never-appearing <b>white</b> <b>folks.</b> It was, however, laudable in its desire to showcase the talents of African-American performers who were denied opportunities in Hollywood." ...|$|E

He also faced racist hostility from players and has claimed that, among others, [...] "Ty Cobb didn't like colored people". Radcliffe also recalled stopping the team car to buy gas in Waycross, Georgia. When the players tried to drink water from the car wash hose, the owner of the gas station told them, [...] "Put that hose down—that's for <b>white</b> <b>folks</b> to drink."

2500|$|Early blues {{frequently}} {{took the}} form of a loose narrative. African-American singers voiced his or her [...] "personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the cruelty of police officers, oppression at the hands of <b>white</b> <b>folk,</b> [...] hard times".
