25|$|After {{the neighbors}} have {{left and the}} kings are resting, the mother {{attempts}} to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the Christ Child ("All That Gold"). She is thwarted by the kings' page ("Thief! Thief!"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him ("Don't You Dare!"). Seeing Amahl's defense {{of his mother and}} understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, <b>Woman,</b> <b>You</b> Can Keep That Gold"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful <b>woman.</b> <b>You</b> can almost feel the pain in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E

2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> must take me. I am powerful. Yonder <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E

Bocoum is the lead vocalist. Bocoum uses music as a medium of communication, commenting on contemporary Malian society, e.g., [...] "if you betray one <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> betray all women" [...] (Yarabitala), [...] "we live in a crazy world with no respect; tomorrow we’ll be judged by our children" [...] (Salamm aleikum), [...] "parents, do not force your daughters to marry; a home will never flourish without true love" [...] (Mali woymoyo).|$|E

His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy.
