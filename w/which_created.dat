5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, <b>which</b> <b>created</b> a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E

The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, <b>which</b> <b>created</b> the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
