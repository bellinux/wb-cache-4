5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E

Celia discovers that Jack has been {{having an affair}} with Dawn Cunningham (Lisa Williamson) and returns to America, taking Darren with her. Darren returns to live with his father two years later. Darren becomes friends with Luke; {{together}} they stand up to bully Mark. When Mark's bullying of Luke becomes more severe, Darren decides to befriend Mark in the hope he will go easy on Luke. His attempts do not succeed and Mark rapes Luke. After the attack, Luke's relationship with Mandy begins to fail, so Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Mandy. Darren suggests that Luke might be gay and that he was responsible for his own rape. Mandy breaks up with Darren. Darren trashes his sister Ruth's (Terri Dwyer) flat and is evicted; he leaves the village soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily <b>with</b> <b>parents.</b> She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

40|$|Experiments with radiation-induced {{bone marrow}} chimeras have {{demonstrated}} that the T cell repertoire for self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products and antigen is profoundly affected by the developmental milieu (1 - 7). Stem cells from (A × B) Fa mice that develop in a parent A animal become adult T cells restricted to recognizing antigen in association <b>with</b> <b>parent</b> A MHC products. No cooperative interactions <b>with</b> <b>parent</b> B cells can be detected. In addition, when parent A stem cells mature to adult T cells in (A × B) F 1 animals, they develop the capacity to interact <b>with</b> <b>parent</b> B and Fl-specific MHC products. Furthermore, parent A cells that develop in a parent B host recognize antigen only in association <b>with</b> <b>parent</b> B MHC products. No cooperative interactions <b>with</b> <b>parent</b> A cells are detectable. Thus, {{it appears that the}} genetic restrictions expressed by adult T cells are acquired during their passage through the host thymus.

5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership <b>with</b> <b>parents,</b> in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, SpongeBob SquarePants {{signed a}} {{marketing}} deal with Target Corporation and Burger King, expanding its merchandising. The popularity of SpongeBob has translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan, as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Ratings and merchandise sales showed SpongeBob SquarePants has caught on <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> and with college audiences. In a recent promotion, college-oriented website Music.com gave away 80,000 SpongeBob T-shirts, four times more than during a similar promotion for Comedy Central's South Park.|$|E

Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> who could not care properly for them.

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> and offspring communicating.|$|E
5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, <b>with</b> <b>parents</b> reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the Tripartite system. In 1965, the Labour Government issued Circular 10/65 requesting Local Education Authorities implement comprehensive schooling. In 1971 Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. A new plan which envisaged Carre's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout; the County Council approved it but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised so that Carre's would be an 11–18 school and adsorb Sleaford Secondary Modern's Church Lane site. Despite support from most staff and all three headteachers, Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for consultation in 1975. A new system was proposed which retained all three schools, and when the Government ordered the Council to choose a comprehensive scheme in 1977 it submitted that proposal, which had become popular <b>with</b> <b>parents.</b> The next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small, but the council voted against the two-school system once more.|$|E
