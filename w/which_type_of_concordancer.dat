50|$|It was Tim Johns (1991), however, {{who raised}} {{the profile of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>concordancers</b> in the {{language}} classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL). DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordancers</b> and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen (2011).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Concordancers are {{tools that}} display the {{immediate}} context for the occurrences of a given word in a corpus. Also called KWIC – Key Word in Context tools, they are essential {{in the work of}} lexicographers, corpus linguists, and translators alike. We present an enhanced <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordancer,</b> <b>which</b> relies on a syntactic parser and on statistical association measures in order to detect those words in the context that are syntactically related to the sought word and are the most relevant for it, because together they may participate in multi-word expressions (MWEs). Our syntax-based concordancer highlights the MWEs in a corpus, groups them into syntactically-homogeneous classes (e. g., verb-object, adjective-noun), ranks MWEs according to the strength of association with the given word, and for each MWE occurrence displays the whole source sentence as a context. In addition, parallel sentence alignment and MWE translation techniques are used to display the translation of the source sentence in another language, and to automatically find a translation for the identified MWEs. The tool also offers functionalities for building a MWE database, and is available both off-line and online for a number languages (among which English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Greek and Romanian).

40|$|Concordancers are {{tools that}} display the {{contexts}} {{of a given}} word in a corpus. Also called key word in context (KWIC), these tools are nowadays indispensable {{in the work of}} lexicographers, linguists, and translators. We present an enhanced <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordancer</b> that integrates syntactic information on sentence structure as well as statistical information on word cooccurrence in order to detect and display those words from the context that are most strongly related to the word under investigation. This tool considerably alleviates the users' task, by highlighting syntactically well-formed word combinations that are likely to form complex lexical units, i. e., multi-word expressions. One of the key distinctive features of the tool is its multilingualism, as syntax-based multi-word expression detection is available for multiple languages and parallel concordancing enables users to consult the version of a source context in another language, when multilingual parallel corpora are available. In this article, we describe the underlying methodology and resources used by the system, its architecture, and its recently developed online version. We also provide relevant performance evaluation results for the main system components, focusing on the comparison between syntax-based and syntax-free approaches...|$|R

Several dimensions and questions considered as important (by the authors and/or by us) are addressed: What about the "interdisciplinary cognitive " {{character of the}} approaches adopted by the authors? Is design indeed a domain where the use of CBR is particularly suitable?
