40|$|Grazing {{of winter}} forage {{crops such as}} fodder beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and kale (Brassica oleracea L.) is a common {{management}} option for increasing winter feed supply on New Zealand farms. This practice is most often implemented on South Island farms for feeding nonlactating dairy cows prior to calving. These crops produce high yields of 10 - 16 t DM/ha {{by the time of}} winter grazing. However, there is growing concern that the high stock density during grazing leads to large amounts of urinary nitrogen (N) deposited onto bare soil. The soil often remains fallow until early spring and thus could led to large nitrate (NO₃⁻) leaching losses. Catch crops have been proposed as a mitigation strategy for reducing the N leaching losses from these winter forage grazing systems. The objective of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of the use of a catch crop of oats (Avena sativa L. cv. Milton) to reduce N leaching following <b>winter</b> grazing of <b>fodder</b> beet (Beta vulgaris L. cv. Rivage). This trial used the recently developed suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system to collect field scale measurements NO₃⁻ and ammonium (NH₄⁺) leaching. The results show a catch crop of oats had no significant effect (P> 0. 05) on N leaching from <b>winter</b> grazed <b>fodder</b> beet. This result is thought to be due to the rapid leaching of N from the root zone prior to the establishment of the oats. This occurred because of the above average rainfall which occurred over the trial period. Total N leaching losses from <b>winter</b> grazed <b>fodder</b> beet soil were nevertheless low at 19 and 23 kg N/ha for the fallow and catch crop treatments respectively. This was attributed to the potentially large quantities of gaseous N loss resulting from denitrification due to the wet anaerobic conditions and soil compaction due to trampling damage...|$|R

All catch crops reduced soil sulphate concentrations in the autumn compared to bare soil. Especially the cruciferous catch crops {{had the ability to}} deplete efficiently soil sulphate levels and thus, reduce the sulphate leaching potential. The S uptake in aboveground catch crop was 8, 22 and 36 kg S ha- 1 for ryegrass, <b>winter</b> rape and <b>fodder</b> radish, respectively.

40|$|The Mongolian rural {{economy is}} based on {{livestock}} reared by semi-nomadic herders. Agriculture contributes around 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, and herding {{accounts for more than}} 80 percent of agriculture. According to the 2008 livestock census, Mongolia has about 44 million head of livestock, consisting of goats, sheep, cattle, yaks, horses, and camels. Livestock provide sustenance, income, and wealth to nearly half the residents of Mongolia. Shocks to the well-being of livestock therefore have devastating implications for the rural poor and for the overall Mongolian economy. Major shocks are common because Mongolia has a harsh climate where animals are herded with limited shelter. From 2000 to 2002, harsh winters (dzud) killed 11 million animals. The Government of Mongolia has struggled with the obvious question of how to address this problem. Managing risk in the livestock sector requires a combination of risk mitigation and financial approaches. Pastoral risk mitigation, including <b>winter</b> shelters, <b>fodder</b> crop storage, and improved management of winter pastures, can help herders better prepare for moderate weather events. In extreme dzud events—that is, sudden-onset winter storms with very low temperatures, high winds, and heavy snow—high levels of livestock mortality are often unavoidable. Pastoral and herd management must therefore be complemented by financial mechanisms that provide herder households with immediate liquidity after a disaster. In 2001 the Government of Mongolia requested assistance from the World Bank {{to address the problem of}} frequent high death rates in the livestock population. Traditional indemnitybased livestock insurance (based on individual losses) has proved ineffective in Mongolia because of the high cost of covering animals spread across vast areas, ex ante moral hazard (herders failed to protect their livestock), and ex post moral hazard (herders falsely reported animal deaths). The World Bank recommended an index-based insurance program based on livestock mortality rates by species and soum (county), as well as a comprehensive riskfinancing strategy including self-insurance by herders, market-based insurance, and a social safety net. Index-based insurance can lower administrative costs and reduce moral hazard and adverse selection. Its main disadvantage is the presence of basis risk—that is, the index payout may not exactly match the individual livestock loss. 2020 Vision Focus; BriefPRIFPRI 1; GRP 4; 2020 MTI...|$|R

40|$|In {{dairy farming}} systems {{the risk of}} nitrate {{leaching}} is increased by mixed rotations (pasture/arable) {{and the use of}} organic manure. We investigated the effect of four organic farming systems with different livestock densities and different types of organic manure on crop yields, nitrate leaching and N balance in an organic dairy/crop rotation (barley – grass-clover – grass-clover – barley/pea – <b>winter</b> wheat – <b>fodder</b> beet) from 1994 until 1998. Nitrate concentrations in soil water extracted by ceramic suction cups ranged from below 1 mg NO 3 -N/l in 1 st year grass-clover to 20 - 50 mg NO 3 -N/l in the winter following barley/pea and winter wheat. Peaks of high nitrate concentrations were observed in 2 nd year grass-clover, probably due to urination by grazing cattle. Nitrate leaching was affected by climatic conditions (drainage volume), livestock density and time since ploughing in of grass-clover. No difference in nitrate leaching was observed between the use of slurry alone and farmyard manure from deep litter housing in combination with slurry. Increasing the total-N input to the rotation by 40 kg N/ha per year (from 0. 9 to 1. 4 livestock units/ha) only increased leaching by 6 kg NO 3 -N/ha. Nitrate leaching was highest in the second crop (winter wheat) following ploughing in of the grass-clover (61 kg NO 3 -N/ha). Leaching losses were lowest in 1 st year grass-clover (20 kg NO 3 -N/ha). Averaged over the four, years nitrate concentration in drainage water was 57 mg/l. Minimising leaching losses requires improved utilisation of organic N accumulated in grazed grass-clover pastures.

40|$|Nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{leaching}} from agriculture {{has become}} an increasigly important issue in New Zealand. There {{has been an increase}} in NO₃⁻ leaching in recent years, with the cause of this mainly due to increases in cattle numbers and the application of N fertilisers. NO₃⁻ leaching is of importance due to its economic cost to farmers, environmental impact and potential health risk. Economic cost to the farmers occurs when leached nitrogen (N) has to be replaced with fertiliser N. There is also a major environmental concern about eutrophication. Eutrophication causes an increase in algae and aquatic life and reduces the recreational value of waterways. Winter forage grazing systems leach disproportitally high amounts of N, compared {{with the rest of the}} farming system. There are very few measurements of nitrate leaching losses from below <b>winter</b> grazed <b>fodder</b> beet (FB) in New Zealand. Measurements are needed urgently to quantify and ultimately minimise NO₃⁻ losses from these systems. The current systems of measuring NO₃⁻ leaching suffer from limitations such as being labour intensive, the inability to measure nitrate leaching under cultivation and the need to scale up results from small plots or lysimeters. The objective of this research project was to develop a new system of measuring N leaching that could accurately quantify N leaching under a winter grazed FB crop without the limitations of current systems. The suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system was developed to overcome these limitations. This was done through having a single collection/retrieval site, changing the depth of the top of the suction cup shaft to below the level of cultivation in soil, increasing the number of suction cups per unit area and having a large measurement area (0. 16 ha). The SCALAR system was developed and tested in this research project. The results showed that the SCALAR system successfully overcome the limitations of previous measurement systems. The results of this study showed the total N leaching under the winter grazed FB crop was 106. 9 kg N/ha. Of this, 101. 5 kg N/ha was leached in the form of NO₃⁻ and 5. 4 kg N/ha was leached in the form of ammonium (NH₄⁺). However, these values are likely to have been affected by the development and testing of the SCALAR system and are therefore not considered to be representative of a typical winter grazed FB crop. Future research is still needed to quantify N leaching losses under a winter grazed FB crop using the SCALAR system that has been developed in this project. The SCALAR system will potentially remain in the ground for 20 - 30 years, allowing it to be used in future research to quantify N leaching under a variety of farming systems...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Management of {{nitrogen}} in dairy systems is especially difficult {{due to the}} use of organic manures and the residual effects of the pasture. During grazing a considerable build-up of soil N is often observed. Ploughing of the grassland is therefore followed by a large mineralization that might exceed the demand of the subsequent crop. This might lead to large amount of nitrate being leached. In addition, rotations dependent on organic manures rather than mineral fertilizers are believed to have a higher risk of nitrate leaching. The study present results from simulations with the FASSET model (Berntsen et al., 2003) of nitrate leaching and crop growth in organic dairy systems with two types of manures at two different stocking levels. Method The experiment was established at Foulum, Denmark in 1994 (Eriksen et al. 1999) and had a six-year crop rotation (barley- grass/clover – grass/clover – barley/pea – <b>winter</b> wheat – <b>fodder</b> beet). The grass/clover was grazed by cattle. The four treatments were: two types of manures (slurry and a mixture a deep litter and slurry) at two different levels. These levels correspond to livestock densities of 0. 9 and 1. 4 livestock units ha- 1. The FASSET model was used to simulate the above experiment. The model is a whole farm that contains a crop-soil-atmosphere model, which simulates daily changes in crop growth, soil organic matter and transport of several solutes. The soil organic matter model is based on Petersen et al. (2003). The model simulated all the different treatments in the years 1993 to 2002 using observed management, measured manure application and composition, measured climate data and soil characteristics. Table 1 shows the simulated and observed N input, N harvested and N leached. Both simulations and measurements indicate that the effects of the different types of organic input are small and the effect of the level of input are between 3 - 7 kg-N/ha. The crops had different leaching potential. Winter wheat had the highest simulated nitrate leaching followed by barley/pea mixture, oat, spring barley, beets and grass-clover. A similar crop ranking was observed in the measurements. Table 1. Observed and simulated nitrogen balance.
