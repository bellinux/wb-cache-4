5|$|A {{number of}} American men with {{political}} ambitions {{fought in the}} Black Hawk <b>War.</b> <b>At</b> least seven future U.S. Senators took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one future U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of President Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard {{to break up}} violent protests in the state. In May 1968, he sent the Guard to Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam <b>War</b> <b>at</b> the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|E

5|$|After a spell in {{civilian}} life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No.3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and {{worked closely with}} Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese <b>War</b> <b>at</b> first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.|$|E
5|$|After basic {{training}} in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Flanagan auditioned as a pianist for an army show.

There, he worked as a motion-picture-projector operator. After two years' service he was discharged and returned to Detroit, where he soon became pianist at the Blue Bird again. He again worked with Burrell, as well as Donald Byrd and Yusef Lateef, among others.|$|E

His father, now-retired Colonel Roger Yves Rajoelina, held dual nationality and fought for the French army in the Algerian <b>War.</b> <b>At</b> the age of 13, Rajoelina became the 1987 junior-class national karate champion. While still in high school, Rajoelina began working as a disc jockey at parties and clubs in Antananarivo to earn pocket money. Although Rajoelina's family could afford a college education for their son, he opted to discontinue his studies after completing his baccalaureat to launch a career as an entrepreneur.|$|E

5|$|Based at RAF Abbotsinch near Paisley, the {{squadron}} operated the Hawker Hind light bomber. The members of squadron—both pilots and ground staff—were reservists and completed their service on a part-time basis, in the evenings, weekends {{and an annual}} two–week summer camp. With the approach of war, {{the squadron}} converted to a fighter role and re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire. It mobilised on the outbreak of <b>war</b> <b>at</b> RAF Grangemouth on 6 October 1939 and then to RAF Drem a month later, charged with defending Edinburgh and the shipping area around the Firth of Forth.|$|E

On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|Bremen {{served on}} the East American Station for the {{majority}} of her career, including the ten years before the outbreak of World War I.

In August 1915, she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, but did not see significant action during the battle. Four months later, on 17 December, she struck two Russian naval mines and sank, with the loss of 250 of her crew.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims.

Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E
