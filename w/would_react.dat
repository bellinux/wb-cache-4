5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to {{converse}} with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who <b>would</b> <b>react</b> with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E

Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets <b>would</b> <b>react</b> to the news.

5|$|As {{the rise}} of grunge began to phase punk and {{hardcore}} out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s, Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of alternative rock, showcasing high energy dance music and Zappa-esque theatricality {{in an attempt to}} create something that an audience <b>would</b> <b>react</b> to viscerally instead of passively. Recruiting a horn section led by alto saxophonist Brooks Brown, Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. Wiggles – named after a Parliament song – in November 1988, playing their first show in Springfield as part of a benefit concert for workers of the Nicolai door manufacturing plant, who were then engaged in a union strike.|$|E

5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he <b>would</b> <b>react</b> to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures <b>would</b> <b>react,</b> Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which <b>would</b> <b>react</b> with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children <b>would</b> <b>react</b> to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} assault against FSB Coral on {{the night}} of 12/13 May had demonstrated that the North Vietnamese <b>would</b> <b>react</b> violently to Australian attempts to control AO Surfers, and with 1 ATF deployed astride a key route to Saigon and threatening a number of communist bases and staging areas located nearby, further heavy fighting was expected over the following days. In response, the Australians were forced to refine their tactics and Hughes decided to establish strong defensive positions in order to destroy the North Vietnamese by fire, rather than by the painstaking patrolling more familiar to the Australians. The FSBs would be heavily defended by night, while the battalions would conduct defensive patrols by day. Later, fighting patrols up to company-size with armoured support would then be used to locate and destroy the Viet Cong main force bases. As such the Australian concept of operations subsequently evolved from one of searching and clearing in order to locate and cut infiltration and withdrawal routes, into a series of reconnaissance-in-force operations from heavily defended bases. Meanwhile, in AO Manly, 3 RAR continued patrolling for the next seven days, successfully ambushing staging areas and infiltration routes between 13–19 May for the loss of one soldier killed.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level {{that would have been}} impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from the previous generation. For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing <b>would</b> <b>react</b> to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the previous generation.|$|E
