Lawrence was the first guest at Levine's studio (Levcon Studios); they had previously worked together after being introduced by a mutual friend. One day Mars and Lawrence <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car with no money in their pockets {{when they decided to}} try producing for themselves and enlisted the help of Levine who contributed his equipment and expertise in drum programming, sampling and other electronic sounds that dominate.

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Down Beat magazine found Waters's singing [...] "forced and artificial", writing that Folk Singer {{suffers from a}} major flaw: [...] "He only begins to {{come close to the}} power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time, as on 'You Gonna Need My Help' and 'My Home Is in the Delta'". In a retrospective review, Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic, deeming the record's sound fresh and vital. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of AllTime", writing that the [...] "unplugged" [...] playing was pioneering and has since been [...] "beloved by blues and folk fans alike". In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone, a reviewer wrote, [...] "...There aren't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings, but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does. A wonderfully intimate session, it delivers Waters' voice in all its power and subtlety, while rendering his guitar work...with such vivid realism, you would think you <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio...." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson {{performed}} a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two {{also had to}} keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he [...] "must have offered them too much money." [...] Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not {{work in the same}} way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.|$|E

500|$|A {{broken leg}} in 1994 meant Gascoigne {{was unable to}} play for 15 months, {{but by the time}} he {{returned}} to fitness, Terry Venables – his former manager at Spurs – had been appointed as England manager. As England were hosting UEFA Euro 1996 they did not have to go through the qualification process, so they instead played numerous friendlies, most of which featured Gascoigne in the starting line-up. The last of these games was played in Hong Kong, after which numerous England players were photographed on a night out in which Gascoigne and several others having drinks poured into their mouths whilst sitting in the [...] "dentist's chair". The tournament opened with a 1–1 draw with Switzerland, during which Gascoigne was substituted. He scored a memorable goal in the second game of the tournament, against Scotland, when he received the ball from Darren Anderton outside the Scotland penalty area, flicked the ball over Colin Hendry with his left foot and changed direction; Hendry was completely wrong-footed and, as the ball dropped, Gascoigne volleyed it with his right foot past Andy Goram. The goal was followed by the [...] "dentist's chair" [...] celebration referring to the incident before the tournament, where Gascoigne lay on the ground as if he <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dentist's chair, and teammates sprayed lucozade from bottles into his open mouth. England beat the Netherlands 4–1 to make it through to the knock-out stages. They then drew 0–0 with Spain before winning 4–2 on penalties, the last of which was converted by Gascoigne. England drew 1–1 with Germany in the semi-finals, and Gascoigne missed the chance to win the game in extra-time when he came inches away from connecting to an Alan Shearer cross yards in front of an unguarded German net. England lost to Germany in the resulting penalty shoot-out, with Gareth Southgate missing England's sudden death penalty.|$|E

2500|$|Maudgalyāyana {{was able}} to use his powers of mind-reading in order to give good and fitting advice to his students, so they could attain results quickly.

Once some monks were making noise as they <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same building as the Buddha. Maudgalyāyana then shook the building, to teach the monks to be more restrained. But the most-quoted example of Maudgalyāyana's demonstration of psychic powers is his victory over the dragon (naga) Nandopananda, which required mastery of the jhānas (states in meditation). Many of his demonstrations of psychic powers were an indirect means of establishing the Buddha as a great teacher. People would ask themselves, if the disciple had these powers, then how spiritually powerful would his teacher be? ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen and Jack Paar, Garroway {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the {{television}} talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago. Garroway, Studs Terkel, and Hugh Downs all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative [...] "announcer's" [...] intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence.

2500|$|... 19 October 1959 – A Braniff Boeing 707 {{crashed in}} Arlington, Washington. Although the {{aircraft}} was not officially a Braniff aircraft, {{it was due}} for delivery {{the very next day}} and was already wearing the Braniff logo and colors. The aircraft, a Boeing 707-227, registration number N7071, was on an orientation flight with two Boeing test pilots, and two Braniff Captains on board. The Braniff pilot performed a series of Dutch rolls; however, one of the rolls was executed beyond the maximum bank angle restrictions, resulting in a loss of control. The aircraft recovered from the maneuver, but, during the recovery, three of the engines (number 1, 2 and 4) were torn off. The aircraft crashed along the Stillaguamish River northeast of Arlington. The two pilots in the cockpit did not survive the emergency landing, the other two pilots who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tail section did. A bare patch in the trees along the north bank of the river still exists today.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the months}} before the {{resumption}} of war with France, the Navy started preparations that included impressing seamen. The crews of outbound Indiamen were an attractive target.

At sunset, a press gang from HMS Immortalite rowed up to Woodford, while boats from [...] and [...] approached Ganges. As the press gangs approached they were noticed, and the crews of both Indiamen were piped to quarters. That is, they assembled on the decks armed with pikes and cutlasses, and anything they could throw. The officers {{in charge of the}} press gangs thought this mere bravado and pulled alongside the Indiamen, only to meet a severe resistance from the crewmen, who had absolutely no desire to serve in the Royal Navy. The men from Immortalite suffered several injuries from shot and pike that were thrown at them, and eventually the marines opened fire with muskets, killing two sailors on Woodford. Even so, the press gangs were not able to get on board either Indiaman, and eventually withdrew some distance. When Woodfords officers finally permitted the press gang from Immortalite to board, all they found on board were a few sickly sailors.|$|E

2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, we <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dressing room and I cried. I realized what a mistake it was." ...|$|E

Obama said, [...] "They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound ... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start looking at shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up." [...] Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog. On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as [...] "The Meeting". However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at the White House on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. Immediately after he arrived, the family staged a photo op with Bo on the property's South Lawn. At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the Oval Office, to which he responded: [...] "of course." [...] He also gave a nod to President Harry Truman's quote, [...] "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog." [...] The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "air drop" [...] {{sequence}} {{was conceived}} by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6. Razatos told Business Insider {{that he wanted}} to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to [...] "feel real" [...] and fulfill audience's expectations. The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars {{in a way that they}} would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane and did this six times. Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado. There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece. BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed. Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras on the ground, there were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them. While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% didn't. For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky. The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and slid to the ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers. Razatos admits that the air drop sequence was [...] "all real" [...] and that it would be [...] "hard to top".|$|E
