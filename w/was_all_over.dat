5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters {{thought it was a}} fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E
25|$|Bon Jovi mounted another huge {{worldwide}} {{tour that}} continued throughout 1989 and 1990. They visited more than 22 countries and performed more than 232 shows before it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> The personal highpoint {{for the band}} was their June 11, 1989 sell-out homecoming at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. In August 1989, the band headed to the Soviet Union for the Moscow Music Peace Festival. Bon Jovi were the first band officially sanctioned by the Soviet government to perform in the Soviet Union and New Jersey became the first U.S. album to be released legally in the U.S.S.R..|$|E

25|$|South Africa {{lasted a}} little more than a session, with Shaun Pollock batting for two and a half hours in a futile attempt to save the draw. However, Ashwell Prince {{departed}} just before the drinks break, dismissed by Warne for the fourth time in the series, and Boje held out for an hour before edging a ball from McGrath onto his stumps for 13. One over after lunch, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> with Makhaya Ntini bowled by MacGill as South Africa were all out for 181, losing by 184 runs and going 0–1 down before the third and final Test in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was the son}} of General Reynell Taylor and {{was educated}} at Newton College in Devon and at Jesus College, Cambridge. Arriving at Cambridge in 1894, he was picked and awarded a Blue for The Varsity Match rugby game against Oxford University in his first year, and again in 1896, {{appearing}} as a wing three-quarter back. His first-class cricket career as a right-handed middle-order batsman <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> within a week, and consisted of two matches for Cambridge University Cricket Club, both won by Cambridge by an innings, which meant that he had just two first-class innings and in them he made only three runs.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire Phoenix {{got their}} first win in three Twenty20 games, but the quarter-finals still looked out of sight, as they needed to win their last game and Derbyshire lose their last. Batting first, Ian Harvey, Craig White and Phil Jaques all made scores between 40 and 60, to lift Yorkshire to 126 for 1 at one point. Off-spinner Gary Scott and medium-pacer Dale Benkenstein took three wickets between them, but Yorkshire still managed 171 for 7. Durham Dynamos looked in the game when Benkenstein and Gordon Muchall were at the crease, pairing up for 79 for the fourth wicket, but a burst of wickets – thanks to Richard Dawson and Anthony McGrath's bowling – sent Durham to the ropes at 111 for 8. Twelve minutes later, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> for 131, with 17 {{deliveries}} remaining. Yorkshire's 30-year-old seam bowler Adam Warren took two for 32 on Twenty20 debut.|$|E

25|$|Senna took pole, but Prost {{beat him}} away from the grid and led by 1.4seconds {{by the end of the}} first lap. By lap 15, however, Senna <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the back of Prost's McLaren after moving through both Williams and Benettons. He whittled down Prost's 5 second lead to just under a second by lap 30, but the latter pulled a few seconds ahead by the 35th lap. By the end of lap 46, with 7 to go, the gap was just over a second. Senna, further back than he had been earlier in the race, made a move on Prost in the chicane before the start-finish straight. True to his word, Prost closed the gap and the two skidded into the escape road and both engines stalled. Prost jumped from his car. Senna, however, got a push from the marshals and {{returned}} to the track.|$|E
25|$|Maloney {{left the}} club {{at the end}} of the 2002 season but his {{replacement}} proved to be a key in Glory finally getting that elusive title. German midfielder Andre Gumprecht was brought into the club thanks to Stange and made an instant impact. With the NSL disintegrating around them, Glory and Olympic were the only two semi-decent teams still left in the league to galvanise their midfield and fought it out for top spot all season. Glory missed out on the league title, finishing one point behind Olympic. In March 2003, the NSL stripped the club of three points after ruling that Gumprecht had been played before he had been registered. Glory picked up Socceroo Simon Colosimo halfway through the season and eventually won the right to host the 2003 Grand Final after coming out on top of a new, confusing and convoluted league table finals format that had dragged a poor season out. In the Grand Final Glory took the game to Olympic and following a headed goal from in the first half from Harnwell it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> late in the match when Mori saw his shot dribble over the line in dramatic fashion. 2–0 was the end result and d'Avray had delivered the Grand Final victory Glory had yearned for.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{arrived to}} a deserted island, {{and began to}} follow their orders to fortify Alderney as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In January 1942 they built four camps in Alderney: two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two {{concentration}} camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. They were built by the Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) to house the labour used to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, tunnels, air-raid shelters and other concrete and field fortifications. Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and the Lager Sylt camp holding Jewish slave labourers, were transferred to SS administration in March 1943 {{under the control of}} Hauptsturmführer Maximilian List. There are 397 graves in Alderney, which when added to the men who died in ships, takes the total to over 700 out of a total inmate population of 6,000 who lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. On the return to their island, Alderney evacuees had little or no knowledge of the crimes committed on their island during the occupation, because by December 1945, the first date civilians could return home, all the slave labourers had been sent away and the majority of the German troops left behind were not senior staff. Evidence, however, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the island, with concrete fortifications and graveyards for the prisoners kept there during the occupation.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at {{dawn and}} it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> by 14:00. As the Germans searched the forest the SAS men tried to break out. A party of 34 were moving down a forest track when they were ambushed and captured. The leader of the party, Lieutenant Tomos Stephens, was beaten to death by a German officer using a rifle butt; seven captured Maquisards were executed in the woods. The SAS men and the US pilot should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, their fate {{was determined by the}} issue of the Commando Order by Adolf Hitler which called for the execution of commandos. The decision of who was going to execute them was the cause of an argument between the German Army and the SS. It was decided that the army would carry out the execution. On 7 July, the surviving prisoners of war, 30 SAS men and Second Lieutenant Bundy, were taken into the woods near to St Sauvant, forced to dig their own graves then executed by a German firing squad at dawn under the command of SS Major Josef Kieffer. Their bodies were then buried in a mass grave. Three Special Air Service men who had been wounded and hospitalized were killed by the administration of lethal injections. The men executed in the woods were re-interred in the village cemetery of Rom, Deux-Sèvres. The bodies of the three men executed in the hospital have never been found, but they are commemorated by a plaque among their comrades' headstones in Rom.|$|E

500|$|Cagney {{secured the}} lead role in the 1926–27 season West End {{production}} of Broadway by George Abbott. The show's management insisted that he copy Broadway lead Lee Tracy's performance, despite Cagney's discomfort in doing so, but {{the day before the}} show sailed for England, they decided to replace him. This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney; apart from the logistical difficulties this presented—the couple's luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment. He almost quit show business. As Vernon recalled, [...] "Jimmy said that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> He made up his mind that he would get a job doing something else." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes were}} shot in advance. The {{producers}} disliked filming beforehand as they preferred [...] "the audience {{to tell us}} what's good and what's bad." [...] They also were concerned that a flashback episode would {{be mistaken for a}} clip show, but felt it would be believable because they were [...] "flashing so far back into the past." [...] According to Kauffman, certain scenes filmed in the apartment were shot in advance because [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place"; the cast were tired and full and their energy levels were low. Special effects and costume changes meant [...] "three or four scenes" [...] were also pre-shot to ensure the dialogue was happening in front of the audience. This was completed in two days.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going to be doing this again.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, {{there were}} still many who {{questioned}} {{the quality of the}} professional game, claiming the college [...] "amateurs" [...] played with more intensity. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds {{to raise money for the}} unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the superiority of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1930 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win. But from the beginning it was a one way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score, and New York played its backups in the second half. When it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> Coach Rockne told his team, [...] "That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt." [...] The game raised $115,183 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game.*, hapmoran.org, accessed February 14, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, {{he did not feel}} any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live.
