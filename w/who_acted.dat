5|$|In 1760, Maria Theresa {{created the}} council of state, {{composed}} of the state chancellor, {{three members of the}} high nobility and three knights, which served as a committee of experienced people who advised her.

Unlike the latter, Maria Theresa was not an autocrat <b>who</b> <b>acted</b> as her own minister. Prussia would adopt this form of government only after 1807.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{liability}} rules on accident avoidance is studied in {{two types of}} situations in which potential victims and potential injurers act sequentially: those where victims act first and injurers second; and those where the reverse is true. What is of special interest about the working of liability rules in such sequential situations is that the party <b>who</b> <b>acts</b> second behaves {{in response to the}} party <b>who</b> <b>acts</b> first, and that the party <b>who</b> <b>acts</b> first takes this into account. The major result shown is that liability rules induce optimal behavior provided that they lead the party <b>who</b> <b>acts</b> second to act optimally if and only if the first party did so. In an important extension of the basic model considered, however, this result may not hold. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes <b>who</b> <b>acted</b> against the national interests of their peoples.

Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
