6000|$|Future {{researches}} {{may increase}} our knowledge, but at present {{little or nothing}} is known of the divining rod in classical ages, and not very much (though that little is significant) among uncivilised races. It is true that in all countries rods or wands, the Latin virga, have a magical power. Virgil obtained his mediaeval repute as a wizard because his name <b>was</b> <b>erroneously</b> <b>connected</b> with virgula, the magic wand. But we do not actually know that the ancient wand of the enchantress Circe, in Homer, or the wand of Hermes, was used, like the divining rod, to indicate the whereabouts of hidden wealth or water. In the Homeric hymn to Hermes (line 529), Apollo thus describes the caduceus, or wand of Hermes: 'Thereafter will I give thee a lovely wand of wealth and riches, a golden wand with three leaves, which shall keep thee ever unharmed.' In later art this wand, or caduceus, is usually entwined with serpents; but on one vase, at least, the wand of Hermes is simply the forked twig of our rustic miners and water-finders. The same form is found on an engraved Etruscan mirror. {183} ...|$|E
50|$|Ethan Haas Was Right (EHWR) is a viral {{marketing}} campaign developed by Mind Storm Labs to promote its role-playing game Alpha Omega: The Beginning and The End. It involves an apocalypse {{taking place in}} the near future, and those who will band together to survive it and those who bring it down upon this world. The game received publicity online after it <b>was</b> <b>erroneously</b> <b>connected</b> with the J. J. Abrams film, Cloverfield.|$|E
50|$|Later in 1839 Strzelecki {{set out on}} an {{expedition}} into the Australian Alps and explored the Snowy Mountains with James Macarthur, James Riley and two Aboriginal guides: Charlie Tarra and Jackey. In 1840 he climbed the highest peak on mainland Australia and named it Mount Kosciuszko, to honour Tadeusz Kościuszko, one of the national heroes of Poland and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. On Victorian maps (but never on New South Wales maps) the name Mount Kosciusko <b>was</b> <b>erroneously</b> <b>connected</b> to the neighbouring peak, at present known as Mount Townsend and causing later many confusions, including the recent incorrect information on swapping {{the names of the}} mountains.|$|E

5000|$|Flawed {{maintenance}} of the aircraft was the probable cause of the sequence of events.

50|$|China Northwest Airlines Flight 2303 {{lost control}} during {{take-off}} from Xi'an, China. The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154 had had maintenance carried out before its flight, and the autopilot yaw-channel had <b>been</b> <b>erroneously</b> <b>connected</b> {{to the bank}} control, and vice versa. Additionally, this incorrect maintenance was not done in a properly approved facility. When the pilot engaged the autopilot, the aircraft began to oscillate violently. Any attempts to rectify matters only made things worse, as the plane shook itself to pieces, breaking up in midair before the crew could react, killing all on board.|$|R
50|$|Hecataeus of Abdera also {{refers to}} a holy island, sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, {{situated}} in the easternmost part of the Okeanós Potamós, and called in different times Leuke or Leukos, Alba, Fidonisi or Isle of Snakes. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles, in a hilly tumulus, was buried (which <b>is</b> <b>erroneously</b> <b>connected</b> to the modern town of Kiliya, at the Danube delta). Accion ("ocean"), {{in the fourth century}} AD Gaulish Latin of Avienus' Ora maritima, was applied to great lakes.|$|R

Other bands, like Augury (black metal) and Darkcide (doom/death metal) had to stop {{due to lack of}} support or to band members leaving the country.|$|R
