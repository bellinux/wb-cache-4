50|$|The {{title of}} Ceci n'est pas un conte, {{followed}} by Second conte (whose name completely contradicts the first title), betrays Diderot's game. He plays with reality and appearances, truth and falsity, {{as well as}} the perception of truth, falsity, good, bad and the relativity of these notions. The Supplément au voyage de Bougainville, which evoques the morality of a civilisation {{from the end of the}} world, appears much like the keystone that confirms the importance of reflecting on the relationship between morality and guilt. In the image of the painting The Treachery of Images by René Magritte, Diderot <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that a person's behavior is not in itself moral or immoral. Morality is not universal and therefore it is not revealed either.|$|R

50|$|We need {{to further}} {{focus on this}} {{exceptional}} portal and its potential mythological message. It has been long emphasised {{the importance of the}} solar symbols in the local vernacular art. Yet, this portal displays only two rosettes that can be related to the sun and possibly the cross {{as a symbol of the}} Christ, which actually is also connected to the sun. The other symbols are rather linked to the other celestial body, i.e. the moon. The relief moulding rope seems to me to indicate the presence of the snake, which, like other monsters in the ancient legends, protects the sacred room. The snake is a dominant motive on the church portals throughout the Carpathian Mountains, most often in stylized forms, but in a few cases even in plain shapes. According to Mircea Eliade, the snake was considered a lunar beast in the old European beliefs and therefore it is possible to read the lower part of the portal, on each side, as a full or new moon coiled up by a snake. In the same context, we should move our attention upon the indented pattern around the aperture, which in the imagery of the local needle women represents the water wave or the river water, possibly the life giving water of a spring, surprisingly identical with the old Egyptian pictograph for the running water. Consequently, the small triangles filling the space in between the rosettes and crosses may represent small drops of rain fertilising the fields. Naturally, we may wonder: what did these ancient symbols <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us?</b> In the ensemble moon-snake-rain or running water the church carpenter seems to have sought for the regenerating power of the nature.|$|E

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of many studies investigating Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), including our own, {{has been on}} evaluating whether learning has occurred and in determining what factors might have influenced learning. Participants are typically asked to perform certain tasks and answer many questions about their characteristics, preferences, experiences and what they learnt. But what do participants see as relevant <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us; perhaps they think we have missed something important? To answer this question, we chose three diverse studies, concerning realism, interactivity and immersion, and analyse the free-text comments {{to see if any}} patterns could be found in what users were <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> Based on the analysis and literature, we suggest a set of categories and usability attributes to be considered when designing and evaluating VLEs. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|When we {{talk about}} something, we need to {{indicate}} what {{we talk about}}. Sometimes we can use pointing gestures but mainly we {{have to rely on}} words. A pointing gesture can direct attention in perceived space, but how do we direct attention with words? What can we do with speech sounds we hear, to find out what somebody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about something and what that something is? Questions about reference could be posed in different ways. To formulate such questions in the way done above, as questions about how reference relations are established when we use language for communicative purposes, is to pose them within a cognitive perspective. The reference problem conceived cognitively concerns how cognitive processes in which reference relations are established should be characterised...|$|R

30|$|The {{dynamics}} of the research process and of its textual realization build the anthropological object by bringing together {{a complex set of}} negotiations: between the anthropologist and the interlocutors in the field, and among the interlocutors themselves; between the different sources of information, oral and written; between the anthropologist, the theoretical models employed, and the scientific community; between the anthropologist as actor and the anthropologist as the object of self-reflection through time and through the vicissitudes of personal and professional activity; between the anthropologist, the text, and the readers. The ethnographic materials are complex and articulated, ‘constructions of constructions’, interpretations of interpretations’ (Geertz, 1973), consisting in the textualization of what the ethnographer records, of what the ethnographer is able to understand, and of what the interlocutors <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> or can tell us, of what they understand (Sperber, 1982 : 26).|$|E
40|$|One {{problem in}} {{monitoring}} drug safety is {{deciding whether to}} focus on the need for good quality medical information or whether primarily to count the fre-quency of an occurrence. As a medically qualified statistician coming from academia into the adverse reaction field in industry, my original inclination was to be a ’counter’, a believer in the significance of quantity. This was so despite an early warning in my medical student days from Professor Sheila Sherlock. ’Listen to the patient’s history, girl, they are trying to tell you what is wrong with them and the probable cause. ’ With increasing experience I am becoming less of a ’counter ’ and more of a disciple of the need for good detailed information. I believe in detailed case histories from patients who indicate, for example by their withdrawal from clinical studies, that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> something about the safety of medicines. Unfortunately, while patients often try to tell us their case histories in detail, we seem to lack either the time to listen, the motivation to pass on the information, or, even worse, the ability to use it. It is not too worrying if the statisticians are the ’counters ’ and the medical profession the dispensers of good medical detail. I am very worried however when eminent members of the medical profession seem to be excessively keen to interpret drug safety {{in terms of the number}} of adverse reaction reports. Therefore, I view the two recent interesting papers i...|$|E

5000|$|The {{painting}} is especially notable for its dramatic dimensions (30.5 cm x 200 cm), {{and the fact}} that Christ's face, hands and feet, as well as the wounds in his torso, are depicted as realistic dead flesh {{in the early stages of}} putrefaction. His body is shown as long and emaciated while eyes and mouth are left open. The effect of the open eyes and mouth has been described by the art critic Michel Onfray as giving the impression that [...] "the viewer sees Christ seeing: he might also perceive what death has in store, because he's staring at the heavens, while his soul is probably there already.
