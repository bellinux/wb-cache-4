If the supply chain between a company and its end-customer would have a stock depth of [...] "250 days' sales", meaning that it takes at least 250 days for a molecule to travel from a companies' warehouse to the end consumer, and if each firm in such a 250-day supply chain decides to do active destocking of 12%, an amount of stock equal to 30 days' sales (a whole month) is {{taken out of the}} chain. For a company {{at the beginning of the}} supply chain this will result in either a business standstill for a whole month or a 33% decline during three months.This discovery of active destocking, reactive destocking and the Lehman Wave can have important implications for manufacturing scheduling, inventory management, <b>work</b> <b>force</b> <b>management</b> and budgeting.|$|E

Previous research has addressed this process by focusing on the development of phase-specific problem solving methodologies. For practicing managers, it may be more beneficial to evaluate various policy options that management may pursue in addressing the nurse work force issue in light of the nationwide shortage of qualified nurses. This research evaluates management policy at the staffing phase since these decisions have the broadest impact on nurse work force utilization. The impact of nurse staffing policy options on annual nursing labor costs are evaluated for a large public hospital in the State of Florida. A linear programming staffing model served as the research vehicle for the study and response surface methodology was used to investigate the relationship between labor costs and the policy options. Service level, nurse labor availability, nurse staffing mix and flex-staff assignment had the most significant effects on annual nursing labor costs. The implications of these findings for <b>work</b> <b>force</b> <b>management</b> and suggestions for future research are presented. health service LP policy analysis operations management...|$|E

40|$|Racist and {{cultural}} stereotypes in Australia have been rooted {{in both the}} economic and social environment of the receiving society at the time. That environment interacted with and shaped the immigrant's opportunities and aspirations, so that living stereotypes of labour market activity emerged. This paper is concerned with the expression of cultural and racist stereotyping and the relegation of different ethnic groups to particular segments of the labour market. It discusses the representation of NESB migrants in the labour market in the 1990 s, usually disproportionately represented among the lower paid occupations in private and public sector service employment. As there has been little recognition of cultural diversity in the Australian <b>work</b> <b>force,</b> the <b>management</b> of diversity is a little known concept in corporate Australia.

Librarians are expected to be capable of anticipating them and addressing them appropriately in order to satisfy the requirements set up by users. This article is an attempt to discuss the most important changes that have hitherto been done and to indicate those areas of the activity of research, academic, public and, to a lesser degree, school libraries in which those changes will be particularly pronounced. Anticipated roles and tasks within the management and access to resources, building up own electronic resources and their processing, library space, embarking on tasks hitherto not regarded as strictly ''library" tasks as well as the most important changes in the author's view such as those to be introduced in user services, in-service trainings, education and propagation of knowledge are discussed in the article. The author believes that the new functions, on par with those already existing, should be subjected to actual users, but also to potential ones, even deeper than before. This should effect in creating the library environment as a ''meeting place", some kind of a social space to perform entirely new functions superimposed onto traditional ones in the library information. The new functions will include performing new cultural, educational, social, artistic and communal tasks carried out with a co-operation with other libraries, scientific, educational and cultural instructions. Additionally, the problem of changes in <b>work</b> <b>force</b> <b>management,</b> so vital in the supposed and anticipated transformation of the library and its functions, is evaluated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} models and {{standards}} that provide guidance for improving software, systems, and other organizational processes. The scope of these standards and models is more extensive than the Capability Maturity Model ® for Software (SW-CMM ®), and CMM Integration SM. This article describes approaches {{taken at the}} Federal Aviation Administration and at Lockheed Martin to assure process improvement meets comprehensive needs across these enterprises. Fueled by the premise that improving products is predicated on improving processes used to develop and deploy them, early process improvement efforts based on the Capability Maturity Model ® (CMM®) were focused on software systems. Documented cases of software systems fraught with problems underscored the need for scrutinizing software engineering processes against an industrystandard model compiled from proven best practices. A plethora of benefits {{have been attributed to}} using the CMM for Software (SW-CMM) 1 across a broad spectrum of areas directly related to business growth and success. Such benefits include improvements in quality (measured in terms of defect reduction or earlier detection), productivity, cost, and schedule. Due to the scope of the model used, these benefits focused on the software aspects of system development, since improvements were typically constrained to software engineering processes and those directly supporting them. Successful software process improvement spawned the development of models focused on other disciplines, including systems engineering and <b>work</b> <b>force</b> <b>management.</b> Each new model was earmarked for use across a subset of an organization, e. g., the systems engineering or software engineering organizational elements. The resulting stovepiped approach to process improvement resulted in inefficiencies caused by a different model for each discipline, and often inattention to integrated process improvement. However, as capability maturity model use extended across an enterprise, the benefits also accrued in those areas where process improvement ensued. In 1998, an industry and government need surfaced for an integrated maturity model to achieve efficiency and effectiveness of processes and process improvement in a multidisciplinary environment...|$|E

50|$|Some {{institutions}} {{have been more}} vocal and active in pursuing such matters; for instance, some firms {{believe that there are}} investment advantages to accumulating substantial minority shareholdings (i.e. 10% or more) and putting pressure on management to implement significant changes in the business. In some cases, institutions with minority holdings <b>work</b> together to <b>force</b> <b>management</b> change. Perhaps more frequent is the sustained pressure that large institutions bring to bear on management teams through persuasive discourse and PR. On the other hand, some of the largest investment managers—such as BlackRock and Vanguard—advocate simply owning every company, reducing the incentive to influence management teams. A reason for this last strategy is that the investment manager prefers a closer, more open and honest relationship with a company's management team than would exist if they exercised control; allowing them to make a better investment decision.|$|R

Among these were the administration of opinion surveys, supervisor training, employee roundtables, incentive pay procedures, wage surveys, employee complaint procedures, personnel records, application procedures, job evaluations, and legal services. As part of his union busting strategies, all of these activities were performed with the goal of maintaining complete control of the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> by top <b>management.</b> Shefferman's book not only provided the concepts that animated all future union busting techniques, he also provided language that pro-labor supporters believe mask the intent of the policies.|$|R

40|$|While {{issues like}} {{off-line}} short-term scheduling, sequencing, real-time control and rescheduling of automated manufacturing or assemblysystems are well established and widely discussed in literature, human resources have seldom {{been considered a}} critical management parameter in the addressed industrial contexts, since they are characterized by {{a high level of}} automation. The objective of this study is the assessment of the influence of <b>work</b> <b>force</b> and related <b>management</b> policies on the operating performances of an automatedassemblysystem. Although workers’ main tasks, in these systems, are characterized by short duration and tend to be spaced by long intervals, during which automated machines operate autonomously, it is postulated that the way the human interventions on the system is organized may have a profound impact on its performances. For this purpose, a simulation model of a real automated PCB assemblysystem has been used to test the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of different work-force management rules. More in detail, we compared several work-force management contexts differing in the number of workers in the crew, the way tasks are assigned to operators and the way operators are assigned to machines in the shop. The obtained results allowed us to disclose useful directions on work-force management in automatedsystems, highlighting how job enlargement issues, typical of lean production philosophy, have great relevance in determining the best work-force management policies...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. This study {{looks at}} what Sasol {{must do to}} retain senior black managers. The {{findings}} of this study are based on the perspectives of a group of black professionals who went through a two year program referred to as Sasol's Accelerated Leadership Development Program (ALDP). Given the fact that the company has acknowledged the problem of having senior black managers in its ranks, the objective is to use their own perspectives on what Sasol must do to retain them. The question of retaining employees is critical given the stiff competition that Sasol operate in and also taking into account the fact that Sasol is expanding outside the borders of South Africa. The respondents pointed out {{that there are a number}} of issues which Sasol's management must look at in order for them to stay in the company. The issues raised relate to Sasol's corporate culture which is perceived not to be accommodative of a diverse <b>work</b> <b>force,</b> the <b>management</b> style which is seen as conservative and bureaucratic. Over and above that, the predominant use of Afrikaans, whilst English is the official business language is seen as an obstacle for non-Afrikaans employees to stay in the company. Other issues raised are the Senior Mannekrag Beplanning Kamer (SMBK), a process used for the promotion of senior managers which is seen as not representative. The respondents felt that they need to be given challenging work assignments and be given opportunities for career growth and development. Equally important is the question of the work environment in general which is not seen as embracing diversity and remuneration and benefits which are seen to be fair and competitive. The findings are indicative of the importance of informing retention strategies with the views of the very employees that must be retained. These results further suggest that a planned approach which is inclusive of stakeholders is appropriate rather than an imposed plan...|$|R
