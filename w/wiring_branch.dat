40|$|The {{correlation}} between surface morphology and interface properties of (Al, Ga) As quantum wells (Qwell) grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on GaAs (100) and patterned GaAs (311) Ga substrates is investigated by atomic force and {{scanning electron microscopy}} in comparison with spectrally and spatially resolved cathodoluminescence (CL), as well as micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. On unpatterned GaAs (100) substrates, both the surfaces and Qwell interfaces exhibit at least two roughness components with correlation length on a nanometer and micrometer scale. On GaAs (311) Ga substrates patterned with mesastripes along the [011] direction, {{one side of the}} mesastripe develops a fast-growing, convex sidewall with thicker Qwell regions below, which are suitable to act as quantum wires.

40|$|Using {{polarization}} dependent scattering spectroscopy, {{we investigate}} plasmon propagation on branched silver nanowires. By controlling the polarization {{of the incident}} laser light, the wire plasmons can be routed into different <b>wire</b> <b>branches</b> and result in light emission from the corresponding wire ends. This routing behavior {{is found to be}} strongly dependent on the wavelength of light. Thus for certain incident polarizations, light of different wavelength will be routed into different branches. The branched nanowire can thus serve as a controllable router and multiplexer in integrated plasmonic circuits...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for quantum logic circuits is described. In this approach, graph-based circuits are directly constructed on nanowire networks {{and controlled by}} multiple quantum <b>wire</b> <b>branch</b> switches. Potential advantages of the approach are briefly discussed. A novel GaAs branch switch using a nano-scale Schottky wrap gates (WPGs) on etched AlGaAs/GaAs nanowire was fabricated and its basic control characteristics were investigated. WPG realizes tight gate control of quantum transport near wire pinch off and shows clear conductance quantization at low temperatures. Simple circuits for BDD path switching and AND logic function were then fabricated, and they showed correct operation at low temperature. They could be operated at room temperature by increasing power consumption...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to remove partial {{occlusion}} that arises from out-of-focus thin foreground occluders such as <b>wires,</b> <b>branches,</b> or a fence. Such partial occlusion causes the irradiance at a pixel to be a weighted sum of the radiances of a blurred foreground occluder {{and that of the}} background. The result is that the background component has lower contrast than it would if seen without the occluder. In order to remove the contribution of the foreground in such regions, we characterize the position and size of the occluder in a narrow aperture image. In subsequent images with wider apertures, we use this characterization to remove the contribution of the foreground, thereby restoring contrast in the background. We demonstrate our method on real camera images without assuming that the background is static. 1...|$|R

25|$|Wrapping copper or {{aluminium}} <b>wire</b> around <b>branches</b> and trunks {{allows the}} bonsai designer {{to create the}} desired general form and make detailed branch and leaf placements. When wire is used on new branches or shoots, it holds the branches in place until they lignify (convert into wood). The time required is usually 69 months or one growing season for deciduous trees, but can be several years for conifers like pines and spruce, which maintain their branch flexibility through multiple growing seasons. Wires are also used to connect a branch to another object (e.g., another branch, the pot itself) so that tightening the wire applies force to the branch. Some species do not lignify strongly, and some specimens' branches are too stiff or brittle to be bent easily. These cases are not conducive to wiring, and shaping them is accomplished primarily through pruning.|$|R

40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringThere {{are many}} kinds of {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) nanomaterials such as nanofiber, nanoribbon, nanotube and nanowire. They have been widely studied over a decades because they are promising materials for applications in various optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic cell, flexible sensor, phototransistor, organic light-emitting diode. Recently, on the other hand, 1 -D nanomaterials with unique structure morphologies have been developed and applied to optoelectronic devices that can exhibit unusual electrical characteristics, and these unconventional 1 -D nanomaterials were employed for fundamental study in organic electronics. In this work, 1 -D organic semiconductor nanomaterials with unconventional structures including branched nanowires have been developed and used for various optoelectronic devices. In addition, the fundamental charge transport mechanisms have been investigated. First, we synthesized <b>branched</b> <b>wires</b> by modifying the morphology of 1 -D nanowires from solution phase. The injection {{of different kinds of}} non-solvents, such as methanol, ortho-dichlorobenzene or a nanowire-dispersed solution, greatly affected the growth mechanism of nanowires during the π- π stacking of molecules and resulted in the formation of <b>branched</b> <b>wires.</b> Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated for the fundamental study on the charge transport of these branched nanowires. Electrical characterizations of over one hundred samples and investigation of activation energy by temperature analysis suggests that there is difference in the electron mobility of <b>branched</b> <b>wires</b> upon switching the source-drain direction. For second experiment, a highly photo-sensitive material (2 Z, 2 'Z) - 3, 3 '-(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -phenylene) bis(2 -(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) acrylonitrile) (DM-R) and other three materials were synthesized with high purity. These materials were easily fabricated into nanowires by stacking π-π self-assembly in solution-phase. By using these nanowires, highly photo-sensitive field-effect transistor was fabricated and their photo-responsivity was measured in high-vacuum condition to compare with their thin film structure. For third experiment, nanoparticle-embedded magnetically-alignable nanowires were synthesized via the injection of iron oxide nanoparticle dispersed ethanol as a non-solvent in a hot BPE-PTCDI solution. The nanowire was aligned by external magnetic force due to the embedded magnetic nanoparticles inside the body of nanowire. For the application to the memory, the field-effect transistor device was fabricated and its memory characteristics were measured. ope...|$|R

50|$|The {{lesser grey shrike}} hunts from a {{strategic}} post, <b>wire</b> or <b>branch</b> and primarily feeds on insects which it catches in the air or on the ground. The diet includes beetles, moths and butterflies, large flies, grasshoppers, crickets and millipedes. Some fruits such as cherries and figs are eaten to a limited extent. The bird occasionally impales freshly caught prey on thorns for use later, but this is done to a much lesser extent than by some other shrike species. It has been shown experimentally that this species only creates a larder when it is satiated and that prey items are seldom plentiful enough {{for this to be}} the case. The male has been observed to feed the female before starting to create a food store. Repeated experimental exposure of birds to a food surplus significantly increases the rate at which they impale freshly caught prey.
