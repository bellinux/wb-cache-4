5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} {{has occurred}} in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then {{may appear to be}} the edible A.caesarea.|$|E
5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>spot</b> {{syndrome}} {{virus is}} the lone virus (and type species) {{of the genus}} Whispovirus (<b>white</b> <b>spot),</b> {{which is the only}} genus in the family Nimaviridae. It is responsible for causing <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> syndrome {{in a wide range of}} crustacean hosts. <b>White</b> <b>spot</b> syndrome (WSS) is a viral infection of penaeid shrimp. The disease is highly lethal and contagious, killing shrimps quickly. Outbreaks of this disease have wiped out within a few days the entire populations of many shrimp farms throughout the world.|$|R
30|$|In the M 2 compartment, a <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> was present, {{the size}} of which {{was similar to that}} of the M 1 compartment. This <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> was located just on the yellow ring or on the edge of the inner black disk, without a {{significant}} distortion of the M 1 eyespot, in 6 individuals out of 17 (Fig.  2 a, e, f). In these cases, the M 1 eyespot was almost an exact circle. According to a conventional understanding, the central positioning of the <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> within this eyespot suggests that the M 1 <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> corresponds to the organizing center from which morphogenic signals for the eyespot body were released during development in this particular eyespot. On the other hand, 11 individuals showed a distortion of the M 1 eyespot; in these cases, the M 2 <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> was located completely inside the eyespot (Fig.  2 b–d). This likely occurs from a fusion of the smaller M 2 eyespot and the larger M 1 eyespot. Thus, the M 1 <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> appears to have corresponded to a highly active organizing center and the M 2 <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> to either an inactive or less active organizing center.|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} the <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> pattern in Dutch boxer dogs is not known. We studied whether the {{segregation}} of <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in boxers follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Blood samples were collected, along with digital photographs in standard directions of (grand) parents (n 16) and offspring (n 52) from eight litters of Dutch boxers. In order to select heterozygous parents, we selected nonuniform litters, in which at least one puppy was extreme white. On the basis of criteria for the location, the extent of <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> and the mean percentage of pigmented area of the foot soles, we classified 10 dogs as solid colored, 27 as flashy, and 15 as extreme white. This {{was not a significant}} deviation from the expected 1 : 2 : 1 ratio. Because the flashy phenotype seems to be an intermediate between the two homozygotes, <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in the Dutch boxer can be considered to be due to a single gene effect, with incomplete dominance. We have evaluated candidate genes c-KIT (KIT) and EDNRB for segregation with <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> phenotype in these litters. Using polymorphic markers, very near the KIT and EDNRB genes, we found that segregation of the <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> pattern did not coincide with segregation of these polymorphic markers. Thus neither KIT nor EDNRB are likely to be responsible for <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in the Dutch population of boxers. In domestic animals the major locus of <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> is known as the spotting locus (S). This locus comprises, i...|$|R
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{cultivated}} Cucurbita {{species has}} five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with {{various types of}} trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. C.argyrosperma has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of C.pepo leaves varies widely. C.moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence. C.ficifolia leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species {{may or may not}} have <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{long-haired}} mutation, a grey agouti or chinchilla mutation, <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> {{and possibly}} a dilute mutation have also appeared in Shaw's jirds, and <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> and a dilute mutation have shown up in Bushy-tailed Jirds.|$|R
30|$|Thus far, we {{have focused}} on <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> {{patterns}} only in C. tasajera. To investigate whether similar <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> patterns are present in other species, we examined specimens of other nymphalid butterflies—including other Calisto species.|$|R
50|$|A {{long-haired}} mutation, a grey agouti or chinchilla mutation, <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> {{and possibly}} a dilute mutation have also appeared in Shaw's jirds, and <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> and a dilute mutation have shown up in Bushy-tailed Jirds.|$|R
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
40|$|The <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> locus (S) in dogs is {{colocalized}} {{with the}} MITF (microphtalmia-associated transcription factor) gene. The phenotypic {{effects of the}} four S alleles range from solid colour (S) to extreme <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> (sw). We have investigated four candidate mutations associated with the sw allele, a SINE insertion, a SNP at a conserved site and a simple repeat polymorphism all associated with the MITF-M promoter {{as well as a}} 12 base pair deletion in exon 1 B. The variants associated with <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> at all four loci were also found among wolves and we conclude that none of these could be a sole causal mutation, at least not for extreme <b>white</b> <b>spotting.</b> We propose that the three canine <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> alleles are not caused by three independent mutations but represent haplotype effects due to different combinations of causa...|$|R
40|$|This {{case report}} {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} resin infiltration technique (Icon, DMG) with microabrasion (Opalustre, Ultradent Products, Inc.) in management of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions. It demonstrates that although neither microabrasion nor resin infiltration technique can remove <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions completely, resin infiltration technique {{seems to be more}} effective than microabrasion. Therefore resin infiltration technique can be chosen preferentially for management of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions and caution should be taken for case selection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{relation}} between orthodontic fixed appliances use and enamel demineralization is well established. Different preventive approaches {{have been suggested}} to this problem, but controversy remains about which is the best. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a systematic review of clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of materials containing fluorides to lute brackets or cover the bonding interface in order to inhibit the development and progression of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions. The null hypothesis was that fluoride materials do not affect the incidence of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions around brackets. A MEDLINE search was conducted for randomized clinical trials evaluating the development of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions in patients using fixed orthodontic appliances, followed by meta-analysis comparing the results for patients for whom dental materials containing fluorides were used (experimental group) to those for whom these materials were not used (control group). The pooled relative risk of developing <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions for the experimental group was 0. 42 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 25 to 0. 72); hence, when fluoride-releasing materials are used, the patient has 58 % less risk of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesion development. Regarding <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesion extent, the pooled mean difference between the experimental and control groups was not statistically significant (- 0. 12; 95 % confidence interval: - 0. 29 to 0. 04). In conclusion, the results of the present systematic review suggest that fluoride-releasing materials can reduce the risk of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions around brackets. However, when <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions had already occurred, there is no evidence that fluoride-releasing materials reduce the extent of these lesions...|$|R
5|$|Saturn's usually bland {{atmosphere}} occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals {{and other}} features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm {{was an example of}} a Great White Spot, a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of the}} northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great <b>White</b> <b>Spots</b> were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E
5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower eyelid {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales {{with a white}} border between the eyes and the ears. The body is somewhat darker than the head and covered with irregular black and <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> above and is bluish white below. The limbs are yellowish white below. The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , and tends to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a V-shaped marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> This ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell-shaped curtain of skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10-11.5 mm. The forewings are blackish {{brown with}} a narrow straight silvery white fascia. The costal margin has a wedged <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> and another wedged <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> before the tornus. The hindwings are also blackish brown.|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from its congener, P. steinitzi, {{in a number}} of ways, one indicator being the <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on its preopercle. P. steinitzi has either no <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> or a smaller, darker spot, as well as more ornamented head bones.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>White</b> <b>Spot</b> {{was located}} in the Marpole neighborhood, at 67th and Granville Street, at what would be known as Granville House, in Vancouver. The restaurant was called <b>White</b> <b>Spot</b> Barbecue Sandwiches, evolving into a drive-in and dining room.|$|R
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 14-15.5 mm. The ground colour of both wings is yellow, the forewings speckled with very dark greyish brown apically and sometimes diffusely marked antemedial fascia and postmedial fascia. There is a <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> inside the distal end of the cell, a second <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> close to the cell and a third <b>white</b> <b>spot,</b> {{as well as several}} very dark greyish brown striations between the costa and the cell. The hindwings are unmarked.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are shining dark purplish-brown {{or black}} {{with a large}} <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on the disc just beyond the middle, and a <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> or streak which starts {{from the beginning of}} the costal ciliae, but does not reach the dorsal margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are brassy brown at the base, shading outwardly into dark blackish brown in the apical half, {{with a faint}} purple luster replacing the brassy luster of {{the base of the}} wing. There is an elongate creamy <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> in the fold near the base, as well as a large <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on the dorsum and a triangular oblique curved <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on the costa beyond the dorsal spot. The hindwings are dark brown.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown {{from the top of}} its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> within or within and between the saddles.|$|E
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{designing}} a diagnostic kit for <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> syndrome virus. We designed 2 series of primers for diagnosis of viral VP 24 gene and also primers as internal controls which amplify part of genome in both positive and negative samples. DNA of shrimps were extracted and PCR amplification carried out. In this research, a diagnosis kit for <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> disease of shrimps designed and tested using 32 shrimp samples which were dubious to have this disease. <b>White</b> <b>spot</b> virus were found in 23 samples and the other 9 were negative. For extra confirmation, the PCR product was sequenced and deposited to GenBank. We designed a diagnosis kit for <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> disease of shrimps and tested successfully...|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are blackish purple with an obliquely oval <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> {{encircled by}} reddish-orange suffusion. The hindwings are fuscous purple, with an oblong-oval <b>white</b> subcostal <b>spot.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>White</b> <b>spot</b> lesions and {{gingivitis}} represent common, yet challenging, dilemmas for orthodontists. Fluoride {{has shown}} some benefit as a protective measure against demineralization; however, {{this is usually}} insufficient for orthodontic patients with less than ideal oral hygiene. Dentifrices containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate bioactive glass (NovaMin) have been proposed to aid in prevention of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions and gingival inflammation. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine if the use of NovaMin reduces the formation of <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> lesions and improves gingival health in orthodontic patients.|$|R
