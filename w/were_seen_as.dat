5|$|Scottish white terriers were {{recorded}} {{as early as}} {{during the reign of}} James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{almost all}} pterosaurs <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> surface-feeding piscivores, {{a view that}} still dominates popular culture. In reality, however, the {{majority}} of pterosaurs are now {{thought to have been}} terrestrial carnivores or insectivores.|$|E
5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private patients. The {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The {{design of the}} buildings and the therapeutic regime <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General Lunatic Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and the drafting of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Canadian Lady {{made several}} {{important}} changes to their advertising strategy. They introduced television advertising {{and changed the}} emphasis from the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on television—girdles <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.|$|E
5|$|In some Pre-Columbian and North American cultures, labrets <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a status}} symbol. They were the oldest form of high status symbol among the Haida women, though the {{practice}} of wearing them died out due to Western influence.|$|E
5|$|Not {{all aspects}} of {{existence}} <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> deities. Although many deities were connected with the Nile, no god personified {{it in the way}} that Ra personified the sun. Short-lived phenomena, like rainbows or eclipses, were not represented by gods; neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world.|$|E

5|$|The Incense Route {{served as}} a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods. The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.

5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E

5000|$|Faith as contradicting rationality: In this view, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{those views}} that one holds despite {{evidence}} and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pernicious {{with respect to}} rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.|$|R
5000|$|In Tamil, {{the word}} vel means spear that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the weapon of Hindu god Murugan and oor means place.

5|$|This remark {{and others}} {{made in the}} same {{interview}} <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a change in the}} tone, but not in the substance of the teaching of the Church, which includes opposition to same-sex marriage.

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Democratic foe of Bradley {{had begun}} his {{rise to power}} in the Kentucky Senate. Kenton County's William Goebel became {{the leader of a}} new group of young Democrats who <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> enemies of large corporations, particularly the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and friends of the working man. Goebel was known as aloof and calculating. Unmarried and with few close friends of either gender, he was singularly driven by political power.|$|E

50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a part of}} some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an amount of matter 2. A hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a region of space 3. A building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cinema}} closed, it was {{purchased}} by Develop UK, and several {{attempts were made to}} turn the building into a Wetherspoons pub. However these were rejected by the council twice, once in the initial planning application, and also in a subsequent appeal. The application was denied due to the moratorium on new food and drink licences in Withington, part of the town's unitary development plan. In 2002 the building {{was purchased by}} Arrows International. They applied for planning permission in December 2002 to demolish part of the cinema, reconstructing it as five ground floor shops, with 21flats on the upper floors. These plans were withdrawn as they <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> overdeveloping the site.|$|E

5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The exodus, which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E

He beat Christophe Lemaitre to win the 100m at the 2010 European Team Championships, helping Great Britain to second place in the tournament and {{recording}} 9.99seconds – the first sub-10 time by a European athlete in almost four years. Lemaitre and Chambers <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the only gold medal contenders for the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships, but the event defied expectations in terms of times and placings. The Frenchman won in 10.11seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes (all 10.18) saw Chambers finish fifth.|$|E
50|$|Non-state market-driven {{methods are}} often used because of {{allegations}} of ‘state failure’ in managing the environment.
