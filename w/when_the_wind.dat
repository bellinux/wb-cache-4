5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> drops they can, provided {{they have the}} generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blows {{on to the}} sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E

5000|$|Birds {{can gain}} altitude, {{as stated by}} Leonardo, by [...] "raising the {{shoulders}} and beating {{the tips of the}} wings towards itself, thus condensing the air that stands between the tips of its wings and itself". He also describes the flight of a kite as seeking a <b>wind</b> current. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> are high, one will see the bird very high in <b>the</b> sky, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> are low, <b>the</b> bird stays closer to the ground. Leonardo describes how a bird rests in the air, after flapping its wings to gain altitude, by gliding downward to the ground.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{power in}} an open air stream is thus {{proportional}} to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change {{direction in the}} early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is blowing towards the animals, indicating {{the sense of}} smell {{is more important than}} sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

50|$|Its {{strength}} varies {{through the}} year; it is weakest {{during the summer}} months (winter in the northern hemisphere) from November to March <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> tend to blow strongly from the south west northwards. The greatest flow is in the autumn and winter (March to November) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> opposing <b>winds</b> are weakest. Evaporation from the Leeuwin current during this period contributes greatly to the rainfall in the southwest region of Western Australia.|$|R
5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Waters contributed {{songs and}} a score to the soundtrack of the {{animated}} movie <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows, {{based on the}} Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who {{has the ability to}} physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state {{of the world in which}} he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Lake Erie froze over by December 14; {{this was}} a record. An ice-covered Lake Erie usually puts an end to lake effect snowstorms, because <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> cannot pick up {{moisture}} from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow and then dump it <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> reach shore.|$|R

Träslövsläge has {{excellent}} conditions for windsurfing, especially <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> come from <b>the</b> southwest. The name Träslövsläge means Träslöv’s harbour.|$|R
5|$|Aware {{that the}} Parliamentarians under Fairfax {{were on their}} way, Hopton {{increased}} {{the attacks on the}} town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused {{on the east side of}} the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blew the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
5|$|For {{three days}} Peard sailed north and east, on several {{occasions}} believing {{that he had lost}} the French only for Ganteaume's ships to reappear over the horizon once more as light winds hampered his escape. At dawn on 13 February, Peard realised that he would eventually be caught and defeated, and swung Success back towards the west, hoping that by doing so he would lead the French straight into any British forces that might now be searching for Ganteaume. The plan failed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> disappeared completely at noon, and by 15:00 two French ships of the line had approached within gunshot. Hopelessly outnumbered, the frigate surrendered without further resistance and was attached to the French squadron as Succès, the crew provided by detachments from other vessels. Peard and his men joined the prisoners taken from Incendiary and Sprightly on Ganteaume's flagship Indivisible and were closely questioned as to British movements in the Mediterranean. When interrogated, Peard informed Ganteaume that the invasion of Egypt was already underway, that the Eastern Mediterranean was controlled by a powerful fleet under Lord Keith and that a squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren was actively hunting the French and could appear at any moment.|$|E

5|$|In 1771 his Synopsis of Quadrupeds was published; {{a second}} edition was {{expanded}} into a History of Quadrupeds. At {{the end of}} that same year, 1771, he published A Tour in Scotland in 1769. This proved so popular that he decided to undertake another journey and in the summer of 1772, set out from Chester with two companions, the Rev. John Lightfoot, a naturalist, and Rev. J. Stewart, a Scotsman knowledgeable in the customs of the country. They travelled through the Lake District, Carlisle, Eskdale, which Pennant much admired, Dumfries and Glasgow. In passing, he was fascinated by the account of the inundation of the surrounding farmland by a bursting out of the Solway Moss peatbog. The party set sail in a ninety-ton cutter from Greenock to explore the outer isles. They first visited Bute and Arran and then continued to Ailsa Craig. Pennant was interested in the birds, frogs and molluscs and considered their distribution. The boat then rounded the Mull of Kintyre and continued to Gigha. They would have continued to Islay but were becalmed. During this enforced idleness, the ever-industrious Pennant started on his ancient history of the Hebrides. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> picked up they continued to Jura.|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
5|$|The British {{blockade}} {{continued to}} prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta {{during the early}} summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate Boudeuse, trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates Diane and Justice were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, the frigates given minimal crews of approximately 115 men each. On 24 August, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS Success sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS Genereux and Northumberland. Diane under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS Niobe. Justice, under Captain Jean Villeneuve, was faster however and outran its pursuers, eventually making Toulon, the only ship from Malta to do so during the siege.|$|E
