5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance <b>while</b> <b>riding.</b> On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance <b>while</b> <b>riding.</b> One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E

5|$|In Citi Bike's {{first three}} years of operations, no one died <b>while</b> <b>riding</b> a Citi Bike.

5|$|The {{cerebellum}} modulates {{the outputs}} of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise.

The muscle coordination learned <b>while</b> <b>riding</b> a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
