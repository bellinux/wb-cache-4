2500|$|Douglas’s Monodramas are ten 30- to 60-second videos from 1991, {{conceived}} as interventions into commercial television, broadcast nightly in British Columbia {{for three weeks}} in 1992.

Police recovered a [...]40-caliber handgun that matched the spent cartridges found at the crime scene. On April 1, the Associated Press reported that during phone conversations, Williams confessed to firing back at an unidentified person who was shooting at him during the March 12 protest. His attorney had previously claimed Williams never discharged a firearm during the shooting. On June 3, he was arraigned on two counts of first-degree assault, three counts of armed criminal action, and two weapons charges. Williams pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. No new court date was currently set.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>black.</b> It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dana {{managed to}} wash off the filth {{from the river}} before the {{dizziness}} sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy {{turns out to be}} Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word [...] "nigger" [...] to refer to Dana, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>black,</b> initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live {{on the edge of the}} plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, drag out Alice’s father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of hiding, and helps Alice’s mother, only to be confronted by one of the white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life, Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for her, Kevin assures her that she has only been gone for a few minutes. The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may travel back in time again by packing her a survival bag and by doing some research on black history from the books in their home library.|$|E
