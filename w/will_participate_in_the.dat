Shortly after becoming new owner of the club, Guoga sparked discussions about changing the club's name and invited the public to offer their ideas since the team no longer have connections with the Vainauskas' newspaper Lietuvos rytas. The idea was strictly criticised by the club's elite fans group B Tribūna (Rytas Ultras), who told that the only team they will support is black-white-red Rytas. On June 21, 2017, the new owners organized a meeting, during which first changes were made: public institution Krepšinio rytas was renamed to Statyba in order to remember the historical BC Statyba, Darius Gudelis replaced Martynas Purlys in the club's director position and it was decided that the club's name Lietuvos rytas will be changed in not longer than 1-year term with the most likely but not yet final choice being Rytas. Guoga also told media that it is very likely that at least two Lithuanian basketball stars <b>will</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team activities, bearing in mind Jonas Valančiūnas, Linas Kleiza and Arvydas Macijauskas.
