500|$|Schuyler and Washington were devastated {{upon hearing}} of Montgomery's death. Schuyler {{believed}} that without Montgomery, victory in Canada was not possible. He wrote to Congress and Washington that [...] "My amiable friend, the gallant Montgomery, is no more; the brave Arnold is wounded; and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> a severe check, in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec, May Heaven be graciously {{pleased that the}} misfortune may terminate here." [...] Washington wrote to Schuyler, [...] "In the death of this gentleman, America has sustained a heavy loss, as he had approved himself a steady friend to her rights and of ability to render her the most essential services." [...] Congress reacted to Montgomery's death by {{trying to keep the}} loss as quiet as possible. They feared the news would lower the morale of the troops and civilians.|$|E

Berridge commented on the casting: [...] "After a search which has taken more than two years, and in which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> literally hundreds of people, we have finally found the perfect cast for our dynamic new family. We're delighted to welcome the Ferreiras to Albert Square and I'm sure the viewers will be too." [...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted. We workshopped constantly, trying out different improvisations with the actors and the characters evolved." ...|$|E

[...] The only topics excluded... are those which touch the realm of politics or the domain of religion. [...] In our literary symposia controversy has no place. With all our freedom and variety of opinion, my colleagues will bear me witness, our discussions have never degenerated into personality or rancor.

In so doing, we have achieved a number of breakthroughs in this vital arena. For well over a decade, AJC has dedicated itself to forging significant relationships with Arab and Muslim leaders around the world. AJC has traveled extensively in the Muslim world – from Morocco to Mauritania, through the Middle East and the Gulf states, to Indonesia. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> with scores of Muslim leaders, including top officials of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia, Bosnia, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to discuss topics ranging from relations with Israel and the United States to the promotion of international Muslim-Jewish dialogue." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 December, T. V. Soong {{arrived in}} Xi'an, and Soong Mei-ling arrived two days later, {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} Chiang's release. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition {{when it became clear}} that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: [...] "In the ten years since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>met,</b> you seem to have aged very little." [...] Chiang nodded and said: [...] "Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say." [...] Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several years}} Truffaut had become {{increasingly}} interested in people {{from his life}} who had died, beginning with his mentor and father-figure André Bazin, who had died the day before Truffaut began shooting his first feature, The 400 Blows. Truffaut told a reporter for L'Express: [...] "I'm faithful to the dead, I live with them. I'm forty-five and already beginning {{to be surrounded by}} dead people." [...] In 1977 Truffaut lost two other important father-figures: Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois and Roberto Rossellini, whom Truffaut called [...] "the most intelligent man, with André Bazin" [...] during an interview with Le Matin de Paris. Around this time Truffaut had watched Shoot the Piano Player and noticed that half the actors had since died. In an interview with [...] magazine Truffaut asked [...] "Why not have the same range of feelings for the dead as for the living, the same aggressive or affectionate relationship?" [...] and added that he wanted to film [...] "what {{it would be like to}} show on screen a man who refuses to forget the dead." [...] According to him, The Green Room is not the worshipping of death, but an extension of the love for the people that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> and who are no longer alive, and the idea that they have a permanency. What matters is that Davenne refuses to forget, and this refusal is important for Truffaut.|$|E
