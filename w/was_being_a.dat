25|$|Phi Delta Theta {{has played}} a major role in the {{fraternity}} movement. Chief among these <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, which was established in 1910 (an organization that they subsequently left in 2002), and leading the initiative to ban alcohol from Phi Delt houses. Throughout their history, the fraternity became a pioneer in establishing traditions as well as having individual members shape the formation of similar women's organizations. The fraternity has also been the first fraternity to establish itself on over 25 campuses.|$|E
25|$|New England {{began its}} next {{possession}} {{on its own}} 26 with 29seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants' defense didn't allow a single yard—forcing an incompletion on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman Jay Alford on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants' safety Gibril Wilson and caused a turnover on downs with one second remaining. After the incompletion, the game clock briefly read zero (one second was re-added), and coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants' Coach Tom Coughlin at midfield, then an official explained to both coaches that the final second had to be run. The Patriots' defense took the field, and Belichick left for the locker room, not staying for the final play. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters who felt Belichick <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> sore loser, while others noted that he had properly congratulated Coughlin (they also noted Coughlin {{was one of the}} few opposing coaches he didn't loathe) and that the game was over once the Patriots failed to convert on 4th down.|$|E

500|$|Paul Levy, Floyd's obituarist, {{considered}} the broadcaster had [...] "no outstanding talent, {{either as a}} cook or as a TV presenter, no great knowledge of his subject, or any apparent passion for anything but drink. This {{is not to say}} that his first TV programmes were bad – they were, indeed, highly diverting entertainment". The programmes were also highly popular both with the public and other cooks. Following his death of heart disease in September 2009 several fellow chefs voiced their opinions of him. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall considers that Floyd [...] "cooked his ingredients with the love and passion of a gifted amateur", while Heston Blumenthal opines that [...] "His enthusiasm, even when he <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bit crotchety, jumped out of the screen. No-one made TV food programmes quite like him. He had a wealth of knowledge but there was a no-nonsense approach to it all".|$|E
500|$|McDougal {{is an avid}} {{motorcycle}} rider and car collector. Her first modelling assignment <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> promotional model at a Harley-Davidson bike show in Detroit. In 2004, {{she bought}} a pink custom-built motorcycle, and entered an Easyriders sponsored motorcycle competition in Pomona, where her motorcycle won the Best Radical Custom award. She also professes to be a chocoholic and junk food junkie even when she considers herself a [...] "health nut". [...] In her spare time, she works out 5 days a week to stay in shape. When she was Playmate of the Year of 1998, she had a healthy BMI of 19. [...] Although she is a swimsuit model, {{she is not a}} proficient swimmer because of her aquaphobia. She is an animal lover and owned two cats: Brittany and Brandy. McDougal has two tattoos, one is a tattoo of a cat on the second toe of her right foot to honor her cats, the other is that of a cross behind her right ear as a reminder of her spirituality.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} {{negative reaction}} from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, {{due to its}} sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined {{that much of the}} book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy O'Brien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory – and silly – sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{signed a}} five-year deal with League Two side Notts County in August 2009. Campbell said that County, who had {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} a takeover by a Middle Eastern consortium, were the best club for [...] "where I am at the moment in my life", and that the recent appointment of ex-England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as director of football played a [...] "big role" [...] in his decision. He made his debut for County in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe at Christie Park on 19 September. He walked out on the club three days later, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 September. He later admitted he felt embarrassed and that [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> mug" [...] in believing the club's owner's were ambitious billionaires who intended to take the club into the Premier League.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Lebed {{was born}} in the Cossack town of Novocherkassk, in the Rostov Oblast, in 1950. In his youth he was not a bad student but {{preferred}} boxing and chess. He grew up in poverty, the son of a carpenter who spent several years in a Stalin era labor camp, and witnessed the Novocherkassk massacre in 1962. During that time he worked at a factory. He was determined to become a paratrooper and joined the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1969, becoming a cadet platoon and company commander while he was there. In 1982, as an officer of the Soviet Airborne Troops, Lebed became a battalion commander in Afghanistan during the Soviet war there. During his time in Afghanistan, Lebed became popular with the troops under his command. He held this position until 1982 at which point he attended the Frunze Military Academy. Among his duties <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> member of the funeral department during the period of many deaths among the Soviet gerontocracy, including three Soviet rulers.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Alcala {{convinced}} {{hundreds of}} young men and women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his [...] "portfolio." [...] A Times co-worker later recalled that Alcala shared his photos with workmates. [...] "I thought it was weird, but I was young, I didn't know anything," [...] she said. [...] "When I asked why he took the photos, he said their moms asked him to. I remember the girls were naked." [...] "He said he was a professional, so in my mind I <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> model for him," [...] said a woman who allowed Alcala to photograph her in 1979. The portfolio also included [...] "... spread after spread of [...] teenage boys," [...] she said. Most of the photos are sexually explicit, and most remain unidentified. Police fear that some of the subjects may be additional cold-case victims. [...] In 1979, according to later trial testimony, Alcala knocked unconscious and raped 15-year-old Monique Hoyt while she was posing for photographs.|$|E

60|$|The dark fever, {{rising from}} the school yards and the playgrounds and the streets, subtly {{poisoning}} the blood of Bessy Bell, slowly lost its heat and power for the time being.
