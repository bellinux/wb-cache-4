40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} perceptions of an academic writing task held by a lecturer and first year students in the Philosophy department at the University of Zululand. The research takes as its starting point the following premises: that language is inextricably linked to learning; that each academic discipline has a particular discourse which students have to acquire in order to participate as accepted members of the academic community; that learning proceeds most effectively when teaching starts with what is known and moves into the unknown; and that learning takes place through experience and involvement, rather than transmission. The research suggests that many first year students bring with them to university {{an understanding of the}} nature of learning and of knowledge which makes it difficult for them to understand the implicit rules of the discourse of analytical philosophy. My investigation uncovered several of these rules in the study guide written for the course, but it appears that students were not able to discover them and, as a result, experienced great difficulty in fulfilling the assignment task in a way which promoted their understanding of the content. The research also shows that the lecturer's expectations of the task were far removed from the manner in which the students implemented the task. It is argued that the students appear to have reverted to their established writing strategies which consisted of simply repeating what the 'authority' has said. From this it is argued that unless rules of the discourse are made explicit to students, and students understand the content of the course, they will revert to copying and relying on other sources to tell them what to write. One way of making these rules explicit and encouraging students to integrate new knowledge with previous knowledge which they bring with them to university is through providing <b>well-structured</b> <b>writing</b> tasks, and where necessary, developing clearly defined assessment procedures. Writing is the principal means of mediation between the lecturer, who is trying to offer students entry into the discipline, and the student apprentice trying to make sense of the discipline and find his or her own 'voice' within that discipline. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between orthographic-motor integration related to handwriting and students 2 ̆ 7 ability to produce creative and <b>well-structured</b> <b>written</b> text.

A systematic handwriting program can significantly improve the quality of written text by young children experiencing problems with orthographic-motor integration. This study investigated the effectiveness of a handwriting program in remediating older students 2 ̆ 7 problems in orthographic-motor integration and consequently enhancing their written language skills.

40|$|From an {{educational}} perspective, {{a very important}} problem is that of assessment, for establishing competency and as selection criterion for different professional purposes. Among the issues to be addressed are the methods of assessment and/or the type of tests, the range of scores, or the definition of honour degrees. The methods of assessment comprise such different forms such as the spotter examination, short or long essay questions, short answer questions, true-false questions, single best answer questions, multiple choice questions, extended match questions, or several forms of oral approaches such as viva voce examinations. Knowledge about this is important when assessing different educational objectives; assessing educational objectives from the cognitive domain will need different assessment instruments than assessing educational objectives from the psychomotor domain or even the affective domain. There is no golden rule, which type of assessment instrument or format {{will be the best}} in measuring certain educational objectives; but one has to respect that there is no assessment instrument, which is capable to assess educational objectives from all domains of educational objectives. Whereas the first two or three levels of progress can be assessed by <b>well-structured</b> <b>written</b> examinations such as multiple choice questions, or multiple answer questions, other and higher level progresses need other instruments, such as a thesis, or direct observation.

40|$|Background: Orthographic-motor {{integration}} {{refers to}} the way in which orthographic knowledge is integrated with fine-motor demands of handwriting. A strong relationship has shown to exist between orthographic-motor integration and students 2 ̆ 7 ability to produce creative and <b>well-structured</b> <b>written</b> text (De La Paz & Graham, 1995). This relationship is thought to be due to the cognitive load resulting from lack of automaticity in orthographic-motor integration so that writers do not have sufficient resources to accomplish the more demanding aspects of writing. Interventions to improve children 2 ̆ 7 s orthographic-motor integration result in improved written text (Jones & Christensen, 1999). Aim: This study first extended findings related to handwritten text to the relationship between typing and the length and quality of computer-based written text. Second, it examined the efficacy of an intervention to develop proficiency in typing skills on the length and quality of students 2 ̆ 7 written language. Sample: Participants in the first study were 276 Grade 8 and 9 students. In the second study 35 students in Grades 8 and 9 who exhibited very low levels of proficiency in typing were the participants. Methods: In Study 1, orthographic-motor integration related to typing as well as handwriting was assessed for all students. They were asked to complete a piece of handwritten and computer-based text. Students in the intervention study completed the same measures as Study 1, at pre- and post-test. During the intervention half the students completed a daily typed journal and half completed a program designed to facilitate their typing skills. Results: There was a significant relationship between orthographic-motor integration - handwriting and the length and quality of handwritten text, and a stronger relationship between orthographic-motor integration - typing and length and quality of computer-based text. Both intervention groups in the second study showed significant differences in writing skills from pre- to post-test. However, the typing skills group showed significantly better scores on typing and quality of typewritten text than the journal group at post-test. The impact of the intervention was specific to typewritten text. There was no difference in length or quality of handwritten text. Conclusion: It is suggested that developing proficiency in orthographic-motor integration related to typing allows writers to employ their cognitive resources more flexibly when working on a computer, so that they can devote attention to higher-order processes involved in ideation, syntactic and semantic monitoring and pragmatic awareness...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the title}} 2 ̆ 2 Software Engineer 2 ̆ 2 {{is widely used}} {{throughout}} industry, each software practitioner who bears the title is not a software engineer by many standards.

These suppositions expose the ignorance about the historical and legal meaning of 2 ̆ 2 Engineer 2 ̆ 2. Furthermore, the general use of the designation 2 ̆ 2 Engineer 2 ̆ 2 by other non-engineering professions has resulted in weakening the title. Licensing and certification are two possible methods to restrict the use of and restore respectability to the title 2 ̆ 2 Software Engineer 2 ̆ 2. Unfortunately, efforts to license and certify software engineers have led to debate, controversy and opposition throughout the software community. This dissertation presumes that the debate over licensing and certification of software engineers is not truly a debate about licensing and certification but a debate about classification. This dissertation presents a system called SPECS (Software Practitioner Expert Classification System). The researcher suggests that a preliminary step prior to initiating the process of certification or licensing should be one of classification. The goal of classification is to associate the proper job title with the professional qualifications and services of the practitioner. The SPECS prototype has an underlying foundation in software engineering. Eight key components are used to build the classification model. These components include initial professional education, accreditation, skills development, certification, licensing, professional societies, continuing education and code of ethics. The significance of this dissertation is through the research and development of the classification model and the decision support system SPECS, an organization is provided a standard method to properly classify software practitioners and thus identify software engineers that qualify for certification or licensing. In addition, the research contributes to the field of expert system validation, knowledge discovery and knowledge acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the writing identities constructed in the Further Education and Training (FET) Phase and the ways in which these identities either strengthen or impede academic writing at university. Success at university is predominantly dependent on students' ability to express their ideas through writing academic essays or assignments in most faculties. However, studies over the past decade highlight the inability of many South African learners, especially those for whom English is not a home language, to succeed at universities. The poor performance of such students is often linked to the lack of adequate preparation in the FET Phase, which is grades 10 to 12, the grades prior to entering first year undergraduate programmes. The significance of this study is that it sheds light on the discourse features of policy, texts, pedagogy and assessment in the FET Phase and the consequences of these for the construction of writers' identities. Further, it foregrounds the ways that policy positions teachers, learners and learning despite diversity in school cultures, identities and histories, and more importantly the ways that unique local pedagogical contexts construct writer identities as a bridge towards engagement in academic essays and the discourses valued at higher institutions. The intention was thus twofold: on the one hand to understand the writer identities constructed in the FET phase and secondly to shed light on the ways that these identities intersect with academic writing, in an attempt to inform first year writing programmes at universities. This was an ethnographic study that included participant observation, interviews with teachers and document analysis of national curriculum policies, grade 12 English Additional language external question papers and first year student texts. The participants were two grade 10 English classes from two schools with different profiles in terms of learner background, linguistic repertoire, and socio-economic circumstances. The rationale for focusing on grade 10 is that it is the first initiation point into the FET Phase and as such an important site to investigate the ways in which writing identities are activated. I thus ‘shadowed’ these learners for two years, up to the end of grade 11. Finally, I analysed first year student texts produced by learners from these two schools in their first year of study at a Cape Town university. In order to engage with my data, I first drew on Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital, to illuminate the ways in which national policies constructed theories and pedagogies of language teaching and learning, and positioned teachers, as well as the consequences of these policies and positionings for constructing sound writer identities. I then focused on the different organizing practices at the two schools, in order to foreground positionings enacted in local contexts. As a result, the study sheds light on the ways that writer identities were activated at two secondary schools in Cape Town, both of which served a previously disadvantaged population but with one classified as poorly resourced while the other enjoyed the status of a well-resourced school. My study centred on the visible and invisible curricula, the differing kinds of cultural capital they produce and the conversion of this capital into other forms of cultural and symbolic capital (such as access to university) which may eventually be converted to economic capital in the form of access to well-paid kinds of employment. Secondly, I drew on Systemic Functional Linguistics, with its conception of language as socially produced and politically situated and its development by the 'Sydney school' into genre-based pedagogy, as an analytical lens to unpack the language learning and teaching theories underpinning policy documents. This lens was also useful for evaluating the extent to which curriculum, pedagogy and assessment tools inducted learners into the key 'genres of schooling' (such as information report, explanation, and argument) that are necessary for success across the curriculum at school and university. Most importantly, it allowed for a rigorous linguistic analysis of first year student scripts and the extent to which writers managed the three metafunctions, ideational, interpersonal and textual. These metafunctions are the basis for coherent, <b>well-structured,</b> genreappropriate <b>writing.</b> The study found that mismatches between policy framing and the way that writing was taught and assessed in the FET Phase resulted in massive gaps between the writer identities constructed in the FET Phase and the first year writer identities valued at universities. Findings help to pinpoint some of the reasons why particular learners manage to make the transition into tertiary study and why a large number of learners studying through English as an additional language either fail to gain access into university or fail during their first year of study. Finally, findings pointed out the effects of post democracy curriculum shifts and national examinations on classroom discourse and pedagogy, especially in relation to constructing enabling writer identities, and more importantly on the ability of learners making the transition into university to produce academically valued texts in their first year of study...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (English)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In the South African {{secondary}} and tertiary education system {{writing is a}} very important part of the curriculum. Students are expected to master basic writing skills in order to learn how to write longer argumentative essays during their tertiary education. Previous research has shown that tertiary learners, especially Black South African English learners, experience problems in <b>writing</b> <b>well-structured,</b> coherent argumentative essays. Previous research also identifies a number of distinct BSAE grammatical features that could have a detrimental effect on the structure, coherence and grammatical correctness of argumentative student writing. This study investigates one of those features, linking adverbials, and the effect it has on the coherence and cohesion of student argumentative writing in ENL, ESL and EFL student writing corpora. Linking adverbials play a fundamental role in the structuring of a logical argument. Used incorrectly, linking adverbials can confuse the reader of a text and mar the cohesion and coherence of a text. This is a field of study that hasn't been exhaustively investigated in South African or international academic communities. This makes this study all the more important, as it sheds light on the issue of linking adverbial usage in students writing and the effect it has on cohesion and coherence. Although a few studies have been done in this field, there is no evidence that explains the problem of linking adverbials, or a study that has fully investigated the link between linking adverbials, cohesion and coherence. The research done in this study, at least in part, is a beginning to fill this gap. Corpus linguistics methodology forms the basis of the study. This is a linguistic methodology founded on the use of electronic collections of naturally occurring texts or corpora. This study centres on learner corpora. There are two ways of approaching corpora for analysis. One can either take a corpus- based or a corpus-driven approach. In this study a corpus-based approach will be taken, as this method can accurately supply information as to which grammatical structures are found and to what extent they are used. The corpus-based approach entails that one formulates a problem and hypotheses about the problem, and then uses the corpora in order to prove the hypotheses true or false. The main sources of data for this study will be the TLEC (Tswana Learner English Corpus), the Locness Corpus and the Dutch student writing component of ICLE (The International Corpus of Learner English). Each of these corpora consist of argumentative student essays written in English. As machine-readable corpora will be used as the main sources of information in this study, it follows that corpus linguistic data analysis methods will be employed in this study. By using the linking adverbial categories stipulated by Halliday and Matthiesen (2004) as well as Biber et al. (2002 a), corpus samples are tagged and analysed using correspondence analysis. A basic theoretical framework, providing an outline of grammatical concepts, defining various concepts and terms used in the study as well as an interpretative framework which will aid in understanding the deeper underlying issues at the root of the study, is used. The choice of the term 'linking adverbials' and cohesion and coherence is discussed, as well as the link between these concepts. This theoretical framework is used later in the study for the annotation of the data and the data analysis. The numerical data presented in this study shows that the TLEC differs a great deal from the ENL and EFL corpus. One would expect the foreign language English corpus to differ the most, as it is generally expected that foreign language English students are less proficient in English than second language speakers. However, the data presented paints a different picture. The findings of this study are that ENL, ESL and EFL students have different ways of using linking adverbials, showing a surprising tendency that EFL student academic writing adheres more closely to the ENL standard than ESL student academic writing does. Possible explanations involve Williams's (1 987) issues of economy and hyper clarity, Meshtrie's undeletion hypothesis (2003), Van Rooy's (2006) statement that Outer Circle (or New) varieties of English develop their own norms, while expanding circle (or EFL varieties) of English stay closer to the inner circle norm, and language acquisition and tranfer-related issues. All of these may be viable explanations as to why the ESL data are non-standard, and why the data in the ESL corpus differs from that in the ENL corpus. This study also emphasises the finding that BSAE students are not fully literate in academic English and that this is an issue that the educational system needs to address. This study further shows that certain linking adverbial semantic categories are overused by some student communities while others are underused. This study shows that this is a field worthy of concern and has proven that cohesion and coherence is influenced by the misuse of linking adverbials. Master...|$|R
