6000|$|She {{shifted to}} the other foot, but did not {{continue}} her gathering. An impulse seized me, I put down my <b>walkingstick</b> and began picking up pieces of wood, flinging them into the wagon. I looked at her again, rather furtively; she had not moved. Her attitude puzzled me, for it was one neither of surprise nor of protest. The spectacle of the [...] "millionaire" [...] owner of the house engaged in this menial occupation gave her no thrills. I finished the loading.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him as being in some obscure way strategic, that he would leave Guildford not by the obvious Portsmouth road, but by the road running through Shalford. Along this pleasant shady way he felt sufficiently secure to resume his exercises in riding with one hand off the handles, and in staring over his shoulder. He came over once or twice, but fell on his foot each time, and perceived that he was improving. Before he got to Bramley a specious byway snapped him up, ran with him for half a mile or more, and dropped him as a terrier drops a <b>walkingstick,</b> upon the Portsmouth again, {{a couple of miles}} from Godalming. He entered Godalming on his feet, for the road through that delightful town is beyond dispute the vilest in the world, a mere tumult of road metal, a way of peaks and precipices, and, after a successful experiment with cider at the Woolpack, he pushed on to Milford.|$|E
50|$|Creosote bush <b>walkingsticks</b> are herbivores, {{feeding on}} {{creosote}} bush leaves, chunari leaves, {{and various other}} plants. Common predators of the <b>walkingsticks</b> include birds and lizards. Creosote bush <b>walkingsticks</b> are fairly common, {{but because they are}} nocturnal and very well camouflaged, they are hard to spot. They inhabit deserts and cactus forests. They are found in the Sonoran Desert, which extends throughout much of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} experimental research testing effects of seasonal fire on community structure of plants, arthropods, and small mammals in shortgrass steppe. These groups {{of plants and animals}} share the same environment, and therefore, the species in the groups were predicted to respond in a similar way to changes in their environment resulting from fire. The experimental design was completely randomized with 3 treatments and at least 4 replicate 2 -ha plots per treatment. Treatments were growing- and dormant-season fires and unburned. Response variables included: plant species richness; abundance and species richness of beetles (coleopterans), and grasshoppers, crickets, mantids, and <b>walkingsticks</b> (orthopterans); and relative abundance of three species of small mammals: Onychomys leucogaster (northern grasshopper mouse), Spermophilus tridecemlineatus (thirteen-lined ground squirrel), and Reithrodontomys montanus (plains harvest mouse). The groups exhibited some shared patterns of community structure in response to fire, while other patterns appeared to be species-specific. The dormant-season fire treatment was the only treatment that had statistically significantly higher plant species richness than the unburne...|$|R
60|$|The 'Baron' was {{the title}} {{by which the}} young people were wont to {{distinguish}} Mr. Mohun, who, as Lily believed, {{had a right to}} the title of Baron of Beechcroft. It was certain that he was the representative of a family which had been settled at Beechcroft ever since the Norman Conquest, and Lily was very proud of the name of Sir William de Moune in the battle roll, and of Sir John among the first Knights of the Garter. Her favourite was Sir Maurice, who had held out Beechcroft Court for six weeks against the Roundheads, and had seen the greater part of the walls battered down. Witnesses of the strength of the old castle yet remained in the massive walls and broad green ramparts, which enclosed what was now orchard and farm- yard, and was called the Old Court, while the dwelling-house, built by Sir Maurice after the Restoration, was named the New Court. Sir Maurice had lost many an acre in the cause of King Charles, and his new mansion was better suited to the honest squires who succeeded him, than to the mighty barons his ancestors. It was substantial and well built, with a square gravelled court in front, and great, solid, folding gates opening into a lane, bordered with very tall well- clipped holly hedges, forming a polished, green, prickly wall. There was a little door in one of these gates, which was scarcely ever shut, from whence a well-worn path led to the porch, where generally reposed a huge Newfoundland dog, guardian of the hoops and <b>walkingsticks</b> that occupied the corners. The front door was of heavy substantial oak, studded with nails, and never closed in the daytime, and the hall, wainscoted and floored with slippery oak, had a noble open fireplace, with a wood fire burning on the hearth.|$|R

5000|$|Kay <b>WalkingStick</b> {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, on March 2, 1935, the {{daughter}} of S. Ralph <b>WalkingStick</b> and Emma McKaig <b>WalkingStick.</b> Emma was of Scottish-Irish heritage, and Kay's father, Ralph, {{was a member of}} the Cherokee Nation who wrote and spoke the Cherokee language. Ralph {{was born in}} the Cherokee Nation capital of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and attended Dartmouth College. Kay's parents had four other children, and as they raised their family Ralph <b>WalkingStick</b> worked in the oil fields as a geologist. He became an alcoholic. While pregnant with Kay, her mother left Oklahoma with their other children and moved to Syracuse, New York. <b>WalkingStick</b> grew up in Syracuse without having experienced the cultural heritage of her Cherokee ancestors. Her siblings, who spent some of their childhood in Oklahoma, had a better understanding of their father's Cherokee traditions. Her mother told her [...] "Indian stories" [...] and talked about her handsome father. The family was proud to be Native Americans. Kay liked to color and draw from a young age. A number of other members of her family were artists.|$|E

50|$|Aralia spinosa, {{commonly}} known as Devil's <b>Walkingstick,</b> is a woody species of plants in the genus Aralia, family Araliaceae, native to eastern North America.

50|$|This <b>walkingstick</b> is {{native to}} North America. Its range extends from the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida, as far west as New Mexico and northwards to North Dakota.

50|$|The {{creosote}} bush <b>walkingstick</b> only {{moves and}} feeds at night.

50|$|The insect {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} forest throughout North America, where it eats many types of plant foliage. Even though the common <b>walkingstick</b> is a generalist it does tend to prefer foliage from oak and hazelnut trees. Outbreaks of these insects sometimes occur in local areas; however, the insects have no wings, and dispersal {{from tree to tree}} is limited.|$|E
5000|$|She created {{representational}} {{art works}} after college {{which for the}} next 10 years were self-described as [...] "hard-edged" [...] and [...] "realistic". In graduate school during the early 1970s, her work became more abstract and were included in many New York City exhibitions, {{at a time when}} Native American artists' works were seldom exhibited. In graduate school she began to study Native American art and history, seeking to understand her [...] "Indianness". <b>WalkingStick</b> began a series of works about the 19th-century Nez Perce [...] "Chief Joseph" [...] who resisted reservation life. She layered wax and acrylic paint, mixed together onto inked canvas and left the design unpainted then cut to create designs. In 1978 she had a solo exhibition at Bertha Urdang Gallery. <b>WalkingStick</b> later integrated other elements into the works, like small rocks, pieces of pottery, metal shavings, and copper. Throughout the process she added paint with her hands or a knife in the areas exposed from the cut wax to create her final work.|$|E
