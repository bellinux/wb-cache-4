5|$|Four-time world {{champion}} Vettel however {{was unable to}} overtake the <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Valtteri Bottas for fourth. The other <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Felipe Massa had applied the undercut well {{in the early part}} of the race to recover from his pit lane-start to eighth position, but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth, taking one point. The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His {{earliest}} pattern coins designed {{during his tenure}} at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled {{as a student at}} the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.|$|E

5|$|Police {{issued a}} {{statement}} declaring that they were searching for two men whom Chambers had observed at Williamson's apartment prior to his death. Corporal Devon Hugh <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> the Constabulary Communication Network (CCN) informed press that the police suspected that the motive of the attack had been robbery, as evidence pointing {{to the fact that}} Williamson's apartment had been ransacked and a safe removed. However, both friends of Williamson and human rights organisations suggested that – given Williamson's status as an openly gay man – robbery might have been a secondary issue, with homophobia being the main motive behind the crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} matches of round two {{took place on}} the July10 episode of Impact!. The first was between Team International and Team Japan. In this contest, Doug <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Team International {{defeated}} Masato Yoshino by pinfall after slamming Yoshino neck-first onto the mat with his signature Chaos Theory maneuver at the 5 minute mark. In the final match of round two, Team TNA faced Team Mexico. Team TNA's Kaz defeated Team Mexico's Ultimo Guerrero in 5 minutes.

5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave, including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.|$|E

5|$|The top ten contested {{the third}} part of qualifying. Romain Grosjean was unable to post a lap time after having problem with his {{brake-by-wire}} system. At {{the beginning of the}} session, both Mercedes drivers set two fast laps. After the first time around, Rosberg was ahead of Hamilton, but the World Champion improved on his second lap, being two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate. During their final flying laps {{at the end of the}} session, both drivers spun on different parts of the track, Hamilton in turn one and Rosberg in the final corner, meaning the order remained, with Hamilton taking the 45th pole position of his career, drawing level with Sebastian Vettel, who qualified third. Last year's pole sitter Felipe Massa followed in fourth, while Le Mans winner Nico Hülkenberg finished fifth, ahead of the second <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Valtteri Bottas.|$|E
5|$|University of Alabama {{graduate}} and single parent Tahesia Harrigan {{was the sole}} female competitor from the British Virgin Islands, and one of two participating in a track and field event and for the BVI as a whole. Her appearance at Beijing was her first Olympic appearance; she did not compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens because she was pregnant at the time. When at the Olympics, Harrigan competed {{in the first round}} of the 100m dash on 15 August, where she was placed in Heat 2 against, among others, Lauryn <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> the United States and Christine Arron of France. Harrigan ranked third in a heat of eight athletes with a time of 11.46seconds, placing behind Williams by 0.08seconds and ahead of Brazil's Lucimar Moura by 0.14seconds. Overall, Harrigan tied Jade Latoya Bailey of Barbados for 25th place out of 85. She progressed to the next round.|$|E
5|$|When I Airborne Corps was {{committed}} to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions. Browning {{was concerned about the}} timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, and not to make two drops on the first day. This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen.|$|E

5|$|While McLaren {{once again}} succeeded in {{advancing}} both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car {{stopped in the}} first corner due to an electrical fault {{at the start of}} the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte Dévote. The second <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} got under way, Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari {{remained}} motionless {{on the spot}} and only started after all other cars had passed the Finn. Meanwhile, Hamilton got through the first chicane in front of Vettel, but his teammate Rosberg had to avoid Räikkönen's car and lost two places to the two <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Both Lotus drivers were forced to retire {{before the end of}} the second lap, Grosjean due to contact with another car, while Maldonado damaged his chassis when he went over a kerb. While Räikkönen charged through the field to get back up to twelfth place by lap three, Lewis Hamilton quickly increased his advantage over Vettel and moved out of the one-second DRS window. Nico Rosberg was unable to pass Bottas on track and was told by his team to cool his brakes. Further back, the Red Bull sponsored cars moved up the order as well, with Carlos Sainz Jr., Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat fighting for tenth position. Sainz yielded his place on lap 11, when he needed to go into the pit lane for a five-second penalty handed to him for cutting the chicane at the start. By lap 14, Hamilton led Vettel by over eight seconds, with Rosberg still behind both Williams in fifth place, pushing Bottas by enabling DRS on the long straights. Behind the German were the two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress {{directed}} {{the organization of}} the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776. The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in Maryland and Virginia by decree of Congress in mid-1775, and six new companies—two from Maryland and four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. Michael Cresap, Thomas Price, and Hugh Stephenson. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment, which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was an Extra Continental regiment because of its two-state composition. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the Continental Army). The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap's company and Otho Holland <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended {{to the end of the}} year. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, Maryland, and Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.|$|E

5|$|University of Iowa student Kineke Alexander {{qualified}} for the 400m sprint, an event in which she earned eight all-American honors during college competitions. Her participation in the Beijing Olympics marked her Olympic debut. At the Games Alexander competed {{in the first round}} of the event on 16 August. She was placed in Heat 6 and ranked fourth, completing the race in 52.87seconds. She was 0.01 seconds faster than Grenada's Trish Bartholomew (5th place), 0.10 seconds slower than Sudan's Nawal El Jack (3rd place), and 1.35 seconds slower than heat leader Novelene <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Jamaica. Overall, in the first round, Alexander ranked 32 out of 50 competitors, finishing just ahead of Bartholomew and India's Mandeep Kaur and just behind Poland's Monika Bejnar. The overall round one leader, the United States' Sanya Richards, ran 2.33seconds faster than Alexander. Alexander did not advance to the semifinal round, as she was neither in the top three places in her given heat nor in the top three fastest of those who did fall below third place in their heats.|$|E
5|$|When Q3 was contested {{by the top}} ten drivers, Nico Rosberg was {{the first}} to set a time, but Hamilton {{immediately}} went faster, setting a time of 1:23.397, which eventually secured him pole position. Again, both Ferrari drivers went faster than Rosberg, being about three-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. During the last timed runs, Räikkönen moved ahead of Vettel to qualify on the front row, while Rosberg improved his time, but stayed in fourth on the grid. He would later refer to his old power unit as the main reason for his qualifying performance. Nico Hülkenberg posted a time good enough for ninth, but his car came to a halt at the pit lane entrance, after his team had miscalculated the fuel put into his car. The two <b>Williams</b> <b>of</b> Massa and Bottas qualified fifth and sixth respectively, with Hülkenberg's teammate Pérez behind them in seventh, ahead of Romain Grosjean. Marcus Ericsson rounded up the top ten, but was later dropped to twelfth on the grid for impeating Hülkenberg in Q1. It was Hamilton's eleventh pole position in twelve races in the season so far.|$|E
