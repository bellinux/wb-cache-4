5|$|In the 1970s, Jacob Holdt (b. 1947) spent {{a number}} of years in the United States where he photographed scenes of the {{socially}} disadvantaged across the country. In his book American Pictures (1977), a worldwide success, he contrasted these <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the American elite, hoping to provide a basis for social reform.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> his family and friends. The first five chapters cover {{the same time period}} as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, Moscow and Paris. Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken {{while he was a}} student at Chicago's Institute of Design, some of which were published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin used {{thermodynamics}} {{to estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; {{it was only when}} radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Earth returned by the Apollo program.|$|E

25|$|The film's {{depiction}} of radical Islam and Islamists was criticized as Islamophobic. Initially supplied to college campuses for free screenings, the film ignited controversy with 30 airing the film, while several declined including the State University of New York {{at the request}} of Jewish groups. Students attending the screenings at New York University were required to register with IsraelActivism.com <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the event forwarded to Hasbara Fellowships, an organization that brings students to Israel and trains them to be pro-Israel activists on college campuses. The forwarding of names was criticised for stifling dissent and intimidating people.|$|E
25|$|The six-color desert pattern entered {{service in}} 1981 {{at the same}} time as the {{woodland}} BDUs and would be worn in limited numbers by U.S. troops taking part in the biennial Bright Star exercises in Egypt during the 1980s, and by FORSCOM peacekeepers assigned to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Egyptian Sinai Desert, but issued in large numbers prior to the Persian Gulf War. However, there is evidence that the six-color desert pattern camouflage was in use before 1981 <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> American military personnel involved in Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 using this camouflage pattern in the failed attempt to rescue U.S. embassy staff being held hostage in Iran.|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{implement}} changes in The Ladder that included adding [...] "A Lesbian Review" [...] underneath the title {{on the cover}} and replacing the line drawings on the cover <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> actual lesbians, often taken by her partner, Kay Lahusen. Gittings distributed The Ladder in six bookstores in New York and Philadelphia, and one Greenwich Village store displayed the magazine prominently, selling 100 copies a month. The focus of the magazine shifted as well to tackling more controversial issues to spark debate, printing such articles titled [...] "I Hate Women" [...] remarking on women who are politically apathetic, and [...] "To Act or to Teach?" [...] that was a back-and-forth debate on whether it was more effective {{to educate the public}} or take political action.|$|E
500|$|Riefenstahl's books <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the Nuba tribes were {{published}} in 1974 and republished in 1976 as Die Nuba (translated as [...] "The Last of the Nuba") and Die Nuba von Kau ("The Nuba People of Kau"). While heralded by many as outstanding colour photographs, they were harshly criticized by Susan Sontag, who claimed in a review that they were further evidence of Riefenstahl's [...] "fascist aesthetics". The Art Director's Club of Germany awarded Riefenstahl a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975. [...] She also sold {{some of the pictures}} to German magazines. She photographed the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, and rock star Mick Jagger along with his wife Bianca for The Sunday Times. Years later, Riefenstahl photographed Las Vegas entertainers Siegfried & Roy. She was guest of honour at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada.|$|E

500|$|Months {{before the}} release of Halo 3, the game's final testing copy before its gold release—codenamed Epsilon and {{confirmed}} by Bungie to be almost complete—was leaked to the Internet. Microsoft reacted to this leak by having the Xbox Live accounts of gamers caught playing the Epsilon copy banned until the year 9999. Two weeks before Halo 3 was due to be released, full retail copies of the game complete <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the open game box started {{to appear on the}} internet auction site eBay. A week before Halo 3 was due for release, major UK catalog retailer Argos accidentally released some of their final retail copies of Halo 3.

500|$|About [...] further east on {{the road}} to Mokronoge was a Partisan officer {{training}} school with about 130 students. On hearing the fighting from the direction of Drvar, the students marched west initially armed with only pistols and a few rifles. They split into two groups, a smaller group which crossed the Unac and advanced west along the railway line on the ridge leading toward Tito's cave, and a larger group which collected arms and ammunition from several stray canisters of German equipment dropped by parachute. The larger group of students attacked Green and Blue Groups from the east around 08:00, suffering severe casualties, but maintained continuous pressure on the German flank. About 09:00, the Germans had largely secured Drvar, and the available troops went from house to house, armed <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Tito, brutally questioning the civilians they could find. Soon after this commenced, Rybka realised that Partisan resistance was concentrated to the north {{in the vicinity of the}} cave. He therefore fired the red signal flare to rally his troops for an assault in that direction.|$|E
500|$|The {{museum has}} so far {{received}} pledges from four men—an Icelander, a German, an American and a Briton—to donate their penises.

He has this dream that he {{wants it to be}} the most famous penis in the world." [...] According to Sigurður, Mitchell [...] "wanted to have his penis cut off even during his lifetime and then visit the museum." [...] Mitchell sent a cast of his penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime, along <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> it dressed up as Santa Claus and Abraham Lincoln. The donor also tattooed his penis with the Stars and Stripes to make it look more appealing. He says that [...] "I've always thought it'd be really cool for my penis to be the first true penis celebrity" [...] and has made it the star of its own comic book, Elmo: Adventures of a Superhero Penis.|$|E
