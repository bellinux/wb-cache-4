As a composite structure, pre-stressed heavy timber buildings offer sustainable, environmentally-friendly advantages over competing construction technologies utilising structural steel and concrete components. Research at the University of Canterbury is continually investigating the performance and behaviour of this composite heavy timber construction assembly. The following research report provides a fire resistance analysis for pre-stressed heavy timber structures that includes: •	A comprehensive literature review detailing the fire resistance for pre-stressed heavy timber structural components and typical connections; and •	A four-phase series of experiments with epoxy grouted steel threaded rods and proprietary mechanical fasteners to determine the fire resistance properties of steel to <b>wood</b> <b>connections.</b> Laboratory experimentation includes cold testing to determine connection performance at ambient temperature, oven testing to evaluate heating effects on steel to <b>wood</b> <b>connections,</b> cooled testing to determine the residual strength of connections in minor fires and, finally, furnace testing to generate fire resistance design and analysis equations to be utilised for steel to <b>wood</b> <b>connections.</b> Recommendations for the fire performance of connections in pre-stressed heavy timber structures {{are included in the}} report...|$|R

40|$|Wood {{is often}} limited in {{structural}} applications to relatively small structures {{due to its}} lack of homogeneity and low strength compared to steel and concrete. Wood can become a more versatile material if used with Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to form a composite. This thesis {{presents the results of}} an investigation of the increase in yield strength, ultimate strength, and change in yield mode of <b>wood</b> <b>connections</b> when reinforced with FRP. Specifically, this thesis investigates the effects of FRP reinforcement in Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) bolted connections under double shear loading. The FRP investigated consists of uniaxial carbon fibers embedded in a two-part epoxy. Sixteen sample <b>wood</b> <b>connections</b> were tested. Eight samples were reinforced with FRP such that the carbon fibers were parallel to the wood fibers. Eight samples tested were not reinforced and used as a means of comparison. Three sizes of bolts and two failure modes were investigated. All materials chosen are readily available and affordable in the current construction market. Finally, the results of a cost vs. strength gain analysis are presented. FRP reinforcement of the glue-laminated <b>wood</b> <b>connections</b> under double shear loading resulted in an increase in yield strength and ultimate strength of all connections tested when compared to unreinforced samples with the same properties. The addition of FRP reinforcement changed the yield mode for some samples. However, it seems that FRP reinforcement is only cost effective in situations in which a higher ultimate strength is desired, rather than a higher yield strength or change in yield mode. by Kathleen Whelton O'Brien.

Three typical nail and three ypical bolt connections were constructed to include three of the four possible yield modes for <b>wood</b> <b>connections.</b> Two matched samples of each connection type (15 specimens for nails and 10 specimens for bolts) were tested monotonically to either catastrophic failure or a connection slip of 1. 0 inches.

An additional sample of lumber-to-lumber nail connections were fabricated without pilot holes and tested under monotonic loading.
