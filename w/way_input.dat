The recursive call does the same, unless the base case has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute fac(3), this recursively calls in turn fac(2), fac(1), fac(0) ("winding up" [...] the stack), at which point recursion terminates with fac(0) = 1, and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame fac(3), where the final result is calculated as 3*2 =: 6 and finally returned. In this example a function returns a single value.|$|E

Similar baseline distributed approaches of kNN joins problem perform partitioning on both R and S datasets in n blocks each and cross-check for nearest neighbors among all possible pairs, thus requiring n^ 2 reducers. We avoid this issue by computing n overlapping partitioning ranges for both R and S, using each element’s SFC values. This way, we make sure that the nearest neighbors of each R partition’s elements will be detected in the corresponding S partition. We calculate these ranges after properly sampling both R and S, {{due to the fact that}} this process requires costly sorting of the datasets.|$|E

40|$|System {{identification}} of rhythmic locomotor systems is challenging {{due to the}} time-varying nature of their dynamics. Even though important aspects of these systems can be captured via explicit mechanics-based models, {{it is unclear how}} accurate such models can be while still being analytically tractable. An alternative approach for rhythmic locomotor systems is the use of data-driven system identification in the frequency domain via harmonic transfer functions (HTFs). To this end, the input-output dynamics of a locomotor behavior can be linearized around a stable limit cycle, yielding a linear, time-periodic system. However, few if any model-based or data-driven identification methods for time-periodic systems address the problem of input and measurement delays in the system. In this paper, we focus on data-driven system identification for a simple mechanical system and analyze its dynamics in the presence of input and measurement delays using HTFs. By exploiting the <b>way</b> <b>input</b> delays are modulated by the periodic dynamics, our results enable the separate, independent estimation of input and measurement delays, which would be indistinguishable were the system linear and time invariant. © 2015, IFAG...|$|E

A two-way ANOVA, with test condition and listening proficiency level as independent variables and score on the multiple-choice listening test as the dependent variable, indicated that the amount of item preview affected test scores but did not affect high and low proficiency students’ scores differently.

40|$|In recent years, an {{exponential}} {{growing number}} of tools for protein sequence analysis, editing and modelling tasks have been put {{at the disposal of}} the scientific community. Despite the vast majority of these tools have been released as open source software, their deep learning curves often discourages even the most experienced users. For example, in the earlier stages of protein modeling by homology means, the lack of user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the need to make use of many programs in an integrated <b>way,</b> <b>Input</b> and Output file format problems, and platform-dependent installation dependencies, often lead to submition of homology modelling tasks to automatic online servers, with no or poor chances to apply human knowledge and experience in the key-steps required to yield a good model. In order to tackle this issue, a simple and intuitive interface, PyMOD, between the popular molecular graphics system PyMOL and several other tools (i. e., BLAST, ClustalW, CEalign and Modeller) has been developed, to show how the integration of the individual steps required for homology modelling and sequence/structure analysis inside PyMOL can hugely simplify these tasks. PyMOD was developed with an emphasis on ease of use and full customization of the parameters of all the algorithms used for analysis. Database searches, multiple sequence and structural alignments generation and editing, and even the possibility to mix sequence and structure alignments have been implemented in PyMod, with the aim of creating a simple, yet powerful tool for preliminary analysis and building of homology models...|$|E

The {{result is the}} reconstruction of a 3 -D model of the captured object featuring different characteristics in terms of accuracy and time needed to built it up. The goal of this work is the implementation of an algorithm which is capable of computing the orientation parameters of an image sequence in an automatic <b>way.</b> <b>Input</b> elements are the calibration parameters of the camera and the images. Particular attention must be paid during the sequence acquisition: each image must present a good overlap with the next images.

The main advantage of a combined use of the methods of both these disciplines is the possibility to solve some typical problems of one with the other, and vice versa. The process starts with the automatic matching between image triplets by using a feature based matching followed by blunder removal through robust estimation methods of the camera poses. Then a progressive resection alternated to triangulation is carried out to join to the first triplet some further images belonging to other triplets. This task is performed by applying a “Structure & Motion ” technique based on collinearity equations. The developed algorithm has been successfully tested with synthetic and real data. 1...|$|E
40|$|At {{the point}} when an Input filter {{is added to the}} {{converter}} it decreases the electromagnetic Interference (EMI) of power input of converter and enhances the performance of load. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is disturbance because of either electromagnetic induction or electromagnetic radiation discharged from outside source that influence the electrical circuit. The EMI may interfere with or decrease the performance of the electrical circuit. Thus an input filter is for the most part used to lessen the electromagnetic interference in power source side of a converter. The Input filter added to converter to diminish the electromagnetic interference may change the system transfer function, which may bring about instability and influence the performance of the converter. In this <b>way,</b> <b>input</b> filter ought to be such that it will diminish the electromagnetic interference and it ought not to influence the performance and the stability of the system. Different stability criteria are considered in this undertaking to outline an input filter without influencing the performance and the stability of the system. One such criterion is Middlebrook's stability criterion which is chiefly utilized for designing input filter for DC-DC converters. The Middlebrook Criterion was at first proposed to investigate how the stability of a feedback-controlled switching converter is influenced by the addition of an input filter. Its objective is to ensure stability of the system, as well as to guarantee that converter dynamics are not changed by the presence of an input filter. The Middlebrook Criterion gives a basic designoriented sufficient stability condition imposing a small-gain condition on the minor loop gain. In this thesis the design of input filter for various converters using Middlebrook Criterion is studied...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{recognizes the}} need for building simulation/performance tools that can easily {{be integrated into the}} building design process. The study examines available simulation tools and attempts to determine why these tools are not used by building designers/architects. Findings confirm that the complexity of simulation tools created by scientists, who are more technically oriented, discourages use by architects who are more visually oriented people. The evaluation and analysis of available simulation tools suggests a thorough research methodology for creating a new front-end interface that solves current usage problems. The research is limited to the interface design of the new front-end which is named Integrated Building Design Information Interface (IBDII). The new front end provides an interface that allows designers to make more informed decisions during the design process while providing a front-end that supports AutoCAD and permits a user interface where the mode of input is graphical and not numerical. Criteria for the new front-end interface enable the development of a series of mock-up interface designs that are responsive to the needs of architects. A working graphical user interface of the building information prototype is created and is then put through an empirical user testing. The usability testing establishs the usefulness, effectiveness, likeability and learnability of the developed interface design. The testing includes six factors which act as indicators of usability and provide suggestions for future developments. The testing evaluation ascertains that the interface is easy to learn and use. Findings also show that the best feature of integrated building design information front-end is its interface design and there is room for improvement in the <b>way</b> <b>input</b> is selected...|$|E

40|$|Because of high {{growth in}} the {{aquaculture}} industry, the feeding barges are moving out to more exposed areas. This brings problems such as water on deck. In this master thesis, a shallow water equation code has been constructed and used to analyse water on deck for feeding barges. The shallow water flow was validated with comparison with theoretical dam break and experimental results, leading to satisfactory results. To simulate water on deck, the code was made in 1 -D with a strip method, taking the boundary conditions from the outer domain sea-keeping solver. Two methods were used to give the input to the boundary. First the RAOs from WAMIT, which is a linear potential sea-keeping solver, were {{used to make a}} one <b>way</b> <b>input</b> for the boundary. Using this method, the forces did not affect the motion of the barge. An incident wave amplitude of ζ_a= 1 m and wave length to barge length ratio of λ/L= 1. 3 was used. The flow was analysed and found that the peak force would correspond {{to the point where the}} flow stopped going from inflow to outflow conditions. An increase in deck length led to an increase of force, as not all the water could escape between each water shipping period. It also led to a shift in the point to where the maximum force would be found. A convergence test showed small differences in increasing the number of grid points or changing the CFL-number, and 200 grid points and CFL= 0. 8 was used. The second method used was FhSim, which is a time domain sea-keeping solver. Diffraction, Froude-Kriloff and radiation forces were taken from WAMIT. The radiation forces were converted to a state space model, such that the model could handle transient effects such as a sudden water on deck. A whole range of frequencies were investigated, both with barge surge motion locked, and with mooring. Transient effects because of phase difference between forces and wave elevation were observed in the beginning of the simulation, which these two methods helped deal with. It was found that the highest forces came at λ/L= 1. 5 or ω= 1. 17 rad/s for both methods. The effect of the water on deck on the ship motion was investigated, and it was found very little effect for small wave amplitudes. An increase in the deck length had the same effect as in WAMIT, shifting the peak of the force. Two different mooring cable weight configurations were analysed, 60 kg/m and 20 kg/m, and it was found that the heavier cable weight led to the transient effects being faster absorbed. The heavier cable did mean the barge was pulled down however, leading to lower margin against water on deck. A decay test was done in heave, pitch and surge. It was found that the natural frequency of the barge in heave and pitch was ω= 1. 04 rad/s. The damping in these modes was quite high however meaning the motion died out fast. The forces at these frequencies were found to be lower than the previous frequency, because of the surge velocity being important for the water on deck. The surge decay test with the two mooring configurations showed that the natural frequencies in these modes were so small that realistic waves would not excite them. Convergence studies with changing the CFL and number of grid points showed small differences. CFL= 0. 8 and 200 grid points was used with the number of grid points increasing linearly with deck length. Comparing the results from FhSim and WAMIT, it was found that the forces were much higher in FhSim. The reason for this could be the transient effects, but has to be investigated further. When increasing the wave amplitude, it was found that the forces from the water on deck helped limit the motion of the barge. This has to do with the maximum peak of the force being delayed to when the barge is moving upwards, meaning it brakes the motion...|$|E

This changed {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century when capital became a complement of skilled workers and decreased its complementary with low-skilled workers.
