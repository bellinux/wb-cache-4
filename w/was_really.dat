5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> beautiful. People were all really excited like it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving <b>was</b> <b>really</b> Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

5|$|The {{big change}} is that Billy {{is not being}} the big 'I do this—I do that'. It's much better. The band {{arranged}} a lot of songs for this record, and the song writing process was organic.

5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she <b>was</b> <b>really</b> burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E

Now, what people call a Anasakayana (vow of fasting) <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Brahmacharya, for this Atman never perishes which one attains by means of Brahmacharya. And what people call the Aranyayana (life of a hermit) <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Brahmacharya, for the world of Brahmanbelongs to those who by means of Brahmacharya attain the seas Ara and Nya {{in the world of}} Brahman.

5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and not sure which side he <b>was</b> <b>really</b> on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} <b>was</b> <b>really</b> special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together {{of a very}} specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, she {{published}} The Divine King in England, {{in which}} she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies {{all over the world}} sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature.

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} <b>was</b> <b>really</b> advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E

5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.|$|E

Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
