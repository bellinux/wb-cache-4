There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately.

[...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit".

In a September 2015 interview, however, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Graffin also said that Bad Religion would begin writing their new album after the release of this third solo album Millport, which was released on March 10, 2017. Baker said, however, that the album will not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, [...] "It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work.

And she herself wanted to be doing something--it was just because she did not know what it was she ought to be doing that she was reading so extensively and voraciously.
