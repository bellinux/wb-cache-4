5|$|Liverpool <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the First Division for {{the first}} time in eight years in 1962–63. They were up to fifth by March 1963 after 13 unbeaten matches.

5|$|Unknown {{to either}} side at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British {{position}} at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. These men, {{and some of the}} prisoners they freed along the way, <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the American camp by September 29.|$|E

5|$|In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, and <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine {{were placed}} in reserve, leaving Bretagne {{the only member of}} her class in service; while out of service, Provence {{underwent}} a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and was carried out in Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main guns were given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75mm M1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire control station and a rangefinder for the ship's anti-aircraft guns were also added.|$|E
5|$|It took {{until at}} least early August for public {{transport}} to be fully restored in the city. According to Xinhua, 267 buses had been damaged during the rioting; most <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> operation by 12 August. The government paid bus companies a total of ¥5.25million in compensation. Despite the resumption of transportation services, and the government's efforts to encourage visitors to the region, tourism fell sharply after the riots; on the National Day holiday in October, Xinjiang had 25% fewer tourists {{than it did in}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1914, {{the annual}} summer cruise to Norway began. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet {{conducted}} drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, {{as a result}} of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and within a week all the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July Thüringen and the rest of I Squadron <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven. During {{the first year of the}} war, the future anti-Nazi Lutheran pastor Martin Niemöller served aboard the ship as an officer.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and the aircraft carrier Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> port by 12 March. The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{commissioned}} {{near the}} end of the Seven Years' War, Lowestoffe patrolled in British waters until 1773, when it underwent repairs. She was recommissioned in 1777 and served throughout the American War of Independence, including at the Battle of San Fernando de Omoa. After the bulk of the fighting ended, she returned home to Portsmouth in 1782, and did not see battle for the next decade. She spent most of her later years in British and Mediterranean waters, winning particular glory for her part in an engagement with two French frigates in 1795. Her final duties <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the familiar waters of the West Indies, where she was wrecked in 1801 while escorting a convoy in the Caicos Islands.|$|E
5|$|The annual summer {{cruise to}} Norway began on 14 July 1914, despite the rising {{international}} tensions following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills in the Skagerrak before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany due to Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and {{in the span of}} a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E
5|$|Another sortie {{into the}} North Sea {{followed}} on 19–20 October. On 21 December, Nassau ran aground {{in the mouth}} of the Elbe. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E

5|$|By the 2002–03 season, Manchester City <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the Premier League. An unusual route into European {{competition}} for the 2003–04 season {{was provided by the}} UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking, which provided extra UEFA Cup qualifying round places for the leagues with the best records for discipline and positive play. This marked Manchester City's first European participation for 24 years. In the qualifying round City played Welsh club Total Network Solutions. The first leg was the first-ever competitive match at Manchester City's new ground, the City of Manchester Stadium. Trevor Sinclair became the first ever goalscorer at the stadium in a 5–0 win. In the hope of attracting a large crowd, TNS switched the second leg to Millennium Stadium, the national stadium of Wales. With the tie effectively won, City made 10 changes to their team. The match finished 2–0 to City. Against Sporting Lokeren in the first round proper, City won the home leg 3–2, and the away leg 1–0. A tie against Groclin Dyskobolia followed. Both legs were drawn, and just as in 1976, City were eliminated on away goals after a 0–0 draw in Poland.|$|E
5|$|For the club's centenary {{season of}} 197475, Saunders brought {{in only two}} new players, Frank Carrodus and Leighton Phillips. At {{the end of his}} first season in charge, Villa <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the First Division after {{finishing}} second, and had won the 1975 League Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Villa beat Norwich City 10 with Ray Graydon scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the 197576 season Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board. Ellis left the club in a good position on the field. They were in the First Division and the UEFA Cup for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 51 by Antwerp in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the 197677 season, two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 32 in the 1977 Final after a second replay.|$|E
5|$|For the season, {{he played}} in all 34 Bundesliga matches, {{starting}} 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists. Bayern and Müller <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in {{the final of the}} DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E
5|$|On 25–26 September, Ostfriesland and {{the rest}} of ISquadron {{provided}} support for a sweep out to the Terschelling Bank conducted by the II Führer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats). Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18–20 October {{in the direction of the}} Dogger Bank. For the majority of 1917, Ostfriesland was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, Ostfriesland and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and Ostfriesland and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. In March 1918, Natzmer was replaced as the ship's commander by KzS Hans Herr. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23–24 April 1918. Ostfriesland, Thüringen, and Nassau were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of St. Petersburg. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E
