500|$|Ocean {{accepted}} Williams' offer, {{and the two}} {{went into}} the studio to record songs together. After their sessions together, what they had produced was worked sonically {{into the rest of}} the album, one of the tracks becoming [...] "Sweet Life".

A download for the song was posted onto Ocean's personal Tumblr account on July 6, 2012 in promotion of the album. It was simultaneously posted onto his SoundCloud account. The track was released a few days following Ocean's coming out as a bisexual, which sparked additional interest in the song. Ocean performed the track during his 14 show Channel Orange tour through North America.|$|E
