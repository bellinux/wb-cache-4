25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> desired signal.|$|E

Douglass, impressed by Flagstaff's elevation, named it as an ideal location for the now famous Lowell Observatory, saying: [...] "other things being equal, the higher <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better". Two years later, the specially designed [...] Clark telescope that Lowell had ordered was installed. In 1930, Pluto was discovered {{using one of the}} observatory's telescopes. In 1955 the U.S. Naval Observatory joined the growing astronomical presence, and established the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, where Pluto's satellite, Charon, was discovered in 1978.|$|E
