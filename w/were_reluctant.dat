5|$|Meanwhile, Polish forces led {{by general}} Stefan Czarniecki ravaged {{southern}} Swedish Pomerania, and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun. The Habsburg and Brandenburg allies however <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to join Czarniecki, and against John II Casimir's wish decided against taking {{the war to}} the Holy Roman Empire fearing {{the start of a}} new Thirty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

The Germans <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to allocate {{any of their}} wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.

5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E

5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him {{that he would have to}} close the exchange early.

The Pacers tried to trade Dahntay Jones and Solomon Jones to keep Rolle, but the trade fell through and the Pacers <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to drop Solomon Jones {{due to a lack of}} depth in the frontcourt. Had he made the roster, Rolle would have earned $510,000, but instead he made $50,000 in a buyout.|$|E
5|$|Illingworth's final {{match was}} against Queensland in December 1964. He took 0/34 as Queensland batted first and made 270. After scoring seven of his team's 341, he took 1/86 as Queensland {{declared}} at 5/332. Chasing 261 for victory, Illingworth made four as his team lost by 40 runs. Illingworth ended {{his career with}} 15 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.60, and 155 runs at 17.22. The state selectors <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to pick him for Victoria because of the throwing allegations that surrounded him.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic. Research showed that women <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to carry a}} pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to give up}} control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to use the}} railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually {{increased the number of}} coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E

5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to work with them.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May, German Army Group A broke the defences at Sedan and was now free to drive for the English Channel. The Allies {{considered}} a wholesale withdrawal from the Belgian trap. The withdrawal would reflect three stages: the night of 16/17 May to the River Senne, the night of 17/18 May to the river Dendre and the night of 18/19 May to the river Scheldt. The Belgians <b>were</b> <b>reluctant</b> to abandon Brussels and Leuven, especially as the Dyle line had withstood German pressure well.|$|E
