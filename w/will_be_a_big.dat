Susie Liggat {{produced the}} pilot, but Matthew Bouch worked as {{producer of the}} series. Co-writer Gareth Roberts, writing in Doctor Who Magazine, said, [...] "We're all determined that this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> full-blooded drama; that nobody should ever {{think of it as}} 'just' a children's programme."

500|$|The band {{suffered}} a setback, however, when Wentz had an emotional breakdown in February 2005, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. He had {{withdrawn from the}} rest of the group, with his condition only apparent through his lyrics, and had also become obsessed with the recent Indian tsunami and his own self-doubt. [...] "It is particularly overwhelming when you are on the cusp of doing something very big and thinking that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> flop," [...] he said later. Wentz swallowed a handful of Ativan anxiety pills (he described the act as [...] "hypermedicating") in the Chicago Best Buy parking lot. After being rushed to the hospital and having his stomach pumped, Wentz moved back home to Wilmette to live with his parents.|$|E

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character and it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, Murphy {{announced}} the lineup of his Shadow Cabinet, which included posts {{for the two}} people who had stood against him in the leadership contest. Findlay {{was appointed to the}} Fair Work, Skills and Training portfolio, while Boyack became Shadow Minister for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment. Baillie was handed the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, Constitution and Economy, while Marra took on Health, Wellbeing and Sport.

It was also announced that Dugdale would speak for Labour at First Minister's Questions. Lamont did not have a place in the new cabinet, but Murphy stated that she had not wanted one: [...] "Johann and I have been in touch with one another; she has wished me well. I'm looking forward to getting together with her, but Johann wasn't looking for a job in today's reshuffle. I think Johann <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of the Scottish Labour Party for years to come".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were strong. Many critics noted a step-up in quality {{from the first}} season. Newsdays Verne Gay called stated [...] " [...] "Skies" [...] has made the bad guys intriguing, and now if it can only get serious about {{character}} development with the good ones -- humans -- then the second season <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post compared the episode to the first season by saying [...] "Season 2 is a different animal, a much leaner and meaner machine that allows sentiment to be present but unexpressed and depicts a darker world in which innocence is a luxury {{that no one can}} truly afford." [...] Chuck Barney declared [...] "Sunday's explosive two-hour opener boldly delivers on the promise by TNT producers to rev up both the pace and the firepower in Season 2." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called the episode a [...] "strong start overall to Falling Skies Season 2," [...] and continued by praising the performances of Wyle, Patton and Cunningham. Screen Rant's Anthony Ocasio praised the episode. [...] "While further episodes will reveal more, the type of character development, intriguing storylines and exciting action that will be contained in Falling Skies season 2 , there’s no doubt that TNT’s hit drama will likely become an epic adventure, spanning many seasons," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Star Trek cast—who {{had agreed}} {{to appear in the}} new movie, with contracts as-yet unsigned pending script approval—grew anxious about the constant delays, and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount. The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division, reasoning that since the roots of the franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script. A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected. As Paramount executives' interest in the film began to wane, Roddenberry, backed by fan letters, applied pressure to the studio. In June 1976, Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg, a young and active producer, to be executive producer of the project, with the budget expanded to $8 million. Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script. His list included Edward Anhalt, James Goldman, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ernest Lehman and Robert Bloch. To cap off his list, Povill put as his last recommendation [...] "Jon Povill—almost credit: Star Trek II story (with Roddenberry). <b>Will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> shot some day. Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble." [...] The end result was a compiled list of 34 names, none of whom were ever chosen to pen the script. Finally, British screenwriters Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, who had penned the Donald Sutherland thriller Don't Look Now were hired to write a script. Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors, including Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time (or were not willing to work on the small script money budget). Philip Kaufman signed on to direct and was given a crash course in the series. Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for Kaufman, including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Early work was promising and, by the fall of 1976, the project was building momentum.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike Australia, where republican {{sentiment}} {{has been}} relatively strong, {{there has been little}} agitation for a New Zealand republic. Neither National or Labour, the two major political parties currently in parliament have a stated policy of creating a republic, although Peter Dunne's United Future does and some Members of Parliament have publicly expressed their personal support for a republic. Former Prime Minister John Key has said he is [...] "not convinced [...] <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> issue in the short term," [...] but does believe that a republic is [...] "inevitable."

After {{previously}} showing her gospel colours, she has come full circle back to what Destiny's Child has become well known for: smooth and glossy R songs with a dance edge, laced with lyrics about relationships (such as the opener [...] "Hello Heartbreak"), parties ("We Break The Dawn") and teen love (for example, hear the closing song [...] "Too Young For Love"). Though the production quality is undoubtedly extremely high, the lyrical focus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> disappointment to anyone looking for some gospel inspiration. The teen girl audience {{would appear to be}} the target once again, and much digital trickery has been brought into play to help Michelle sound (and look) younger.
