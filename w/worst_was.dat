25|$|This {{critical}} and popular acclaim offered Hazlitt {{the prospect of}} getting out of debt, and allowed him to relax and bask in the light of his growing fame. In literary circles however, his reputation had been tarnished in the meantime: he had openly taken both Wordsworth and Coleridge to task on personal grounds and for failing to fulfill the promise of their earlier accomplishments, and both were apparently responsible for retaliatory rumours which seriously damaged Hazlitt's repute. And the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> yet to come.|$|E
25|$|In late 1792 Phillip, whose {{health was}} suffering, relinquished his {{governorship}} and sailed for England {{on the ship}} Atlantic, taking with him many specimens of plants and animals. He also took Bennelong and his friend Yemmerrawanne, another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The {{early years of the}} colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of £500 a year.|$|E

Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe.

25|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot {{ship had}} 102 passengers and {{a crew of}} about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined {{with a lack of}} proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> yet to come. After arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter. During the voyage there was a turbulent storm during which John Howland fell overboard. He managed to grab a topsail halyard that was trailing in the water and was hauled back aboard safely.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006–07 season, the {{nightmare}} grew even bigger. The supporters saw their two star players leave to Chelsea (Salomon Kalou) and Liverpool (Dirk Kuyt). At the same time, {{it became clear}} Feyenoord were in an appalling financial state despite earlier comments made by chairman Jorien van den Herik, who claimed that the club was financially healthy. Supporters' unrest grew into anger when Feyenoord bought Angelos Charisteas, a back-up striker of arch-rivals Ajax, with a poor track record, {{as a replacement for}} Dirk Kuyt. After continuous protests, Van den Herik resigned and the club began managerial reforms. However, the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> not over. Feyenoord were banned from European competition following hooliganism prior to and during a match against Nancy, despite an appeal by the club. The season ended in bitter disappointment with a seventh-place finish, causing Feyenoord to miss European football {{for the first time in}} 16years. While desperate supporters started preparing for a dark age, the club surprised friend and foe in the 2007 summer transfer window. A brilliant performance of young Dutch left back Royston Drenthe at the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had established. The club appointed former manager Bert van Marwijk and was able to make a number of high-profile signings, including Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Roy Makaay. Despite the efforts, Feyenoord underperformed once again in the Eredivisie, finishing in a disappointing sixth place. The pain was relieved by claiming the first prize in six years: 100years after the foundation of the club, Feyenoord managed to win the KNVB Cup after defeating Roda JC 2–0. As Van Marwijk accepted a job as manager of the national team, Feyenoord appointed Gertjan Verbeek as their manager for the 2008–09 season.|$|E

The <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> in the former, {{with a total of}} 27,000 customers affected and 17 transmission lines. Severe damage also occurred in the agricultural sector; 400hectares of citrus was lost, 80 hectares of greenhouses was destroyed. Losses in the sector were estimated to be at least MXN$500million (US$37.3million). Damages to infrastructure amounted to MXN$300million (US$12.5million). Total losses related to Hurricane Jimena reached 2.3billion pesos ($173.9million). Local water authorities reported that 14,000 people were waterless, because eight pipelines broke. The worst damage occurred in the aqueduct in Santa Rosalía. The officials estimated that the repair would cost about $652,224. A total of 72,000 people were affected and four people were reported dead.|$|E

500|$|It is {{believed}} peak gusts reached 115 mph (185 km/h) in eastern Long Island. Weather forecasters believe that damage across parts of Long Island indicated winds in the Category Three range, {{as evidence of}} the damage received at MacArthur Airport. Gloria's high winds caused significant damage across Long Island and southeastern New York. The area hit the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> eastern Long Island, where high wind gusts blew thousands of trees into buildings and across roads. The broadcast tower of WBLI-FM toppled on Bald Hill in Farmingville. [...] In addition, the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings, including hangars at the MacArthur Airport, a hangar at the Bayport Aerodrome and the roof of the Islip Police Station. Prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion, washing away several piers and docks. The storm surge, though relatively weak, destroyed 48 houses on the ocean side of the island. Gloria's high winds left 683,000 people in New York without power, with some lacking electricity for over eleven days.|$|E
500|$|Rommel was not {{a member}} of the Nazi Party. However, Rommel, as did other Wehrmacht officers, welcomed Hitler's seizure of power. During his time in Goslar, he clashed with those Sturmabteilung (SA) men who {{attacked}} the Jews and others who supported them. Rommel thus showed sympathy towards Hitler's elimination of the SA, believing the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> now over, although he opined that in the future the Führer should learn to see his own true strength and refrain from such illegal processes. Remy dated Rommel's support for Hitler as 1935, noting a speech in which Rommel praised Hitler for restoring German's self-respect and establishment of the way towards an honourable and righteous peace, as well as efforts in alleviating the disadvantaged people's problems. Numerous historians,, such as Ralf Georg Reuth, David T. Zabecki, Bruce Allen Watson and Peter Caddick-Adams, state that Rommel was one of Hitler's favorite generals and that his close relationship with the dictator benefited both his inter-war and war-time career. Historian Robert Citino describes Rommel as [...] "not apolitical" [...] and writes that he owed his career to Hitler, to whom his attitude was [...] "worshipful", while the historian Charles Messenger describes Rommel's [...] "growing admiration" [...] towards Hitler following the invasion of Poland. Speaking at The National WWII Museum's 2012 International Conference on World War II, the author Nigel Hamilton referred to Rommel as [...] "quite a Nazi". This sympathy did not extend to the Party though. In this regard, he was similar to many other Wehrmacht soldiers, who, with encouragement from Hitler, erroneously believed the army to be the most important element of the regime. Rommel showed particular resentment towards the SA and later, the SS, for their brutality and absorption of resources and personnel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{parts of}} Ontario lying near the {{northern}} border of Lake Erie were also struck {{hard by the}} Blizzard of 1977.

[...] Lloyd George's involvement is uncertain; he denied any, but Asquith was certain he was the source. The author was certainly the editor, Geoffrey Dawson, with some assistance from Carson.
