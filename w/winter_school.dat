2500|$|In 1970 a Bahá'í {{club was}} founded in the Fundación Universidad de las Américas, Puebla which was officially {{recognized}} – the first in all Latin America – in 1971. In 1972 traveling speakers on the religion made presentations there. The first international youth conference of Mexico took place in 1973 in Pueblo City with participants from 5 countries swelling to 200 youth. [...] Later in 1975 a series of public concerts by Bahá'í performers at a university of Mérida included audiences of hundreds as well as news coverage. In 1974 teachers and youth from the center at Muna appeared on local television during a <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> on the religion. The first Bahá'í Campus Club at the Autonomous University of Guadalajara, Mexico's School of Medicine was formed in April 1978.|$|E

To encourage fluency, some schoolmasters recommended punishing any pupil who spoke in English. The younger boys learned the parts of speech and Latin words in the first year, learned to construct Latin sentences in the second year, and began translating English-Latin and Latin-English passages in the third year. By the end of their studies at age 14, they would be quite familiar with the great Latin authors, and with Latin drama and rhetoric. Other skills, such as arithmetic and handwriting, were taught in odd moments or by travelling specialist teachers such as scriveners.|$|E

50|$|Already a 1913 doctorate, Joachim Kramer's thesis {{about the}} {{household}} education in Germany {{refers to the}} ongoing reform aspects. The 1870s saw some progress; the first <b>winter</b> <b>schools</b> had been founded by the Badische Frauenverein, founded by Princess Louise of Prussia {{in the state of}} Baden. While the <b>winter</b> <b>schools</b> lost their impact to permanent schools in Baden already before World War I, they gained importance in Bavaria in the 1920s. Kramer compared the German situation and the state of household education abroad. Switzerland, Belgium and Austria had <b>winter</b> <b>schools.</b> The Austrian education for rural women was comparably backward, and Switzerland took a leading position. In France, housekeeping was a topic in primary schools, but not part of higher education. According to Kramer, Iowa and the state of New York in the United States were then leading in the field.|$|R

2500|$|The Sudan/Egypt {{regional}} National Assembly existed until 1953 when {{it became}} a regional assembly for North East Africa. [...] It included French Somaliland; Egypt, Sudan, Abyssinia, Libya, Eritrea, British Somaliland; Italian Somaliland; and Socotra Is. The Bahá'í summer school in Alexandria began having integrated classes with {{women and men in}} 1953 and a newsreel carrying the dedication of the Bahá'í Temple in Wilmette was shown in movie houses in Egypt. In 1955 two new assemblies in Egypt were elected – Damanhur and Shibin El Kom in 1956 in El Mansoura In 1959 the Bahá'ís held their first <b>winter</b> <b>school.</b> At this time the Bahá'ís may have reached 3000 in Egypt. Sabri Elias with his family returned from pioneering to Ethiopia and beyond back to Egypt in 1959. By the late 1950s, there were approximately 5,000 Egyptian Bahá'ís and organized communities of Bahá'ís in 13 cities.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1980s {{there were}} {{never more than}} a dozen Bahá'ís at any one time in Hungary and from 1937 to 1988 there was no press {{coverage}} of the religion. Around 1965 Etelka (Eta) Szász of Budapest became a Bahá'í, after visiting an Esperanto Conference in Vienna. [...] However, in the 1980s Bahá'ís are known to have traveled to Hungary. [...] At least one Hungarian Bahá'í attended an Austrian <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> in Dec. 1985. In 1986 The Promise of World Peace was submitted to the Hungarian government. In 1987 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum toured the country investigating growth of the religion which was followed by a new round of newspaper stories and the opening of an information center in 1989. In January 1990 a Baha'i singing group, El Viento Canta, was able to tour Hungary and meet Baha'is in various homes, be interviewed on television, giving concerts for ambassadors and high school students.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In Pakistan 1967 was a year of multiplying activities. The Bahá'í youth of Karachi sponsored a youth symposium on world peace, {{the community at large}} elected a woman to the national assembly, for the first time elected a local assembly in Rahim Yar Khan, and held a reception for a Bahá'í from the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro with guests including executive engineers, attorneys, businessmen and industrialists, doctors, press representatives, bankers and university students. In 1972 the assembly of Karachi held an observance of United Nations Day which over one hundred people attended. Talks presented dealt with the elimination of racial discrimination. Also in 1972 the government of Pakistan invited the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís to send a delegate to participate in a Conference of the Religious Minorities. By 1974 there were Bahá'ís that were members of the Bhil tribe in Thatta. In 1975 Bahá'ís held meetings for the International Women's Year and a seminar on [...] "Education in Pakistan." [...] In 1976 Bahá'ís were invited to participate in a week long celebration of minorities. Later Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís gathered to commemorate Letter of the Living Táhirih and a Bahá'í was acknowledged as part of the delegation from Pakistan to an Asian conference on religion and peace by the chief Muslim delegate late in the conference. In 1977 membership of the Bahá'ís reached the state of Kalat and Tharparkar. The 1977 <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> gathered 250 Bahá'ís while 1978's gathered 350. In 1978 conditions in Afghanistan, including the Soviet invasion, lead to many Afghan Bahá'ís being arrested in that country and many fled to Pakistan. Iranian Bahá'ís also fled to Pakistan from Iran in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1979 the New Day Montessori School was established with ten students but would grow in time to three hundred and most of the students were not Bahá'ís. At this time Bahá'ís report there were 83 assemblies amongst many hundreds of places Bahá'ís lived which included three district centers and there were 47 delegates to the national convention. In winter 1979–80 Zahida Hina gave a speech on the life and works of Táhirih at a women's conference. In spring 1980 for the International Year of the Child the local assembly of Hyderabad organized an event that showcased children's art, essays, singing and quiz competitions, and the topic of the elimination of racial prejudice was a theme in Bahá'í gatherings in several cities. In the summer an institute and a seminar were held for children and youth covering a variety of topics including [...] "The Role of Baha'i Youth during Political Upheavals." [...] That fall and winter further gatherings were held, this time commemorating the United Nations Day (which highlighted the Commission for Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities) and a talk by a professor of Superior Science College (see Government Colleges affiliated with the University of Karachi) which encouraged discussion on the elimination of prejudices. Before spring 1981 the youth of Karachi organized a conference recapitulating many of the same themes of games, quizzes, a poster contest and round of prayers. Come April and May there was a broad attempt at engaging several interest groups from primary and secondary schools, universities and colleges, professional publishers and the general public through a radio broadcast. Still that spring, president of Pakistan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, wrote an executive order categorizing the Bahá'í Faith as a non-Muslim religion. That December the Bahá'ís again held an observance of United Nations Day in several cities that received press coverage from print and radio. Representatives of the Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Zoroastrian and Bahá'í communities gathered for a symposium in the fall of 1982 with the theme, [...] "The Increasing Social Unrest in the World Today and its Solution" [...] while presentations were made to judges and lawyers about the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran. Still in the fall a women's conference brought together sixty non-Baha'i women who were wives of judges, university professors, headmistresses and teachers to hear talks. And in January 1983 a multi-faith presentation covered [...] "the need of religion" [...] on World Religion Day held in Karachi. In February and April Bahá'ís gathered for regional school sessions in Karachi, Quetta, Rawalpindi and Sibi. In August assemblies were formed {{for the first time in}} Sialkot, near Lahore, and Multan, the birthplace of Letter of the Living, Sa'id-i-Hindi. In September a symposium on Táhirih was held with presentations including Sahar Ansari, a professor of Urdu at the University of Karachi and Zahida Hina with the attendance of noted Pakistani poet, Jon Elia. Also in September a Bahá'í women's group decided to provide treats to students at a government school for physically and mentally handicapped children which evolved into the first set of volunteers helping in the school ever had. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. From December 1984 through July 1985 more than ten vocational or tutorial schools had been set up in several cities and run by Bahá'ís or Bahá'í assemblies. Also in the early 1980s, Bahá'ís in Pakistan started social and economic development projects like small-scale medical camps. In the middle 1980s Iranian Bahá'í refugees who had come to Pakistan began to arrive in other countries. The office attending to the refugees attracted visitors from governments and institutions including members of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (LSHCR) in Islamabad and Lahore; an official from the Ministry of Justice of the Nelherlands; a delegation from Finland that included the Ambassador from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador of the Embassy of Finland in Tehran, and three senior officials of the Finnish government; and the Australian Immigration Officer from Canberra. In 1985 the Universal House of Justice published The Promise of World Peace and in 1986 and the assembly of Hyderabad used the occasion of the International Year of Peace to sponsor a symposium on world peace and present the document to attendees. In 1989 Bahá'ís from Karachi moved to and elected the first local assembly in Muzaffarabad while Bahá'ís from Quetta sponsored a week long series of student competitions that were run in 11 schools in Baluchistan – each day different activities were run; The Elimination of Prejudice, national songs, a quiz game, and a drama contest were among the events held. In 1998, when the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan arrested many Bahá'ís, many fled to Pakistan but many were able to return by 2002.|$|E

Patteson spent the night on shore at Perua, a subsidiary islet in the bay, sleeping {{in a kind of}} shed, upon two boards, more comfortably than was usual on these occasions. Showing confidence was one great point, and the want of safe anchorage in the bay was much regretted, because the people could not understand why the vessel would not come in, and thought it betokened mistrust. Many lads wished to join the scholars, but of those who were chosen, two were forced violently overboard by their friends, and only two eventually remained, making a total of twelve pupils for the <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> at Lifu, with five languages between them --seven with the addition of the Nengone and Lifu scholars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think {{everything}} points to Vanua Lava, the principal island of the Banks group, becoming our centre of operations, i.e., {{that it would}} be the place where <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> would be carried on with natives from many islands, from Solomon Islands group to the north-west, and Santa Cruz group to north, New Hebrides to south and Loyalty Islands south-west, and also the depot among the islands, a splendid harbour, safe both from trade and hurricane winds, plenty of water, abundantly supplied with provisions, being indeed like a hot-house, with its hot springs constantly sending up clouds of vapour on the high hills, a population wholly uninjured by intercourse with traders and whalers, it being certain that our vessel was the first at all events that has ever been seen by the eyes of any member of this generation on the islands; I could prove this to you easily if I had time.|$|E

'They {{are most}} simple, gentle and docile, unwarlike, not cannibals, I verily believe {{as good a}} {{specimen}} of the natural fallen man as can be met with, wholly naked, yet with no sense of shame in consequence; timid, yet soon learning to confide in one; intelligent, and gleaming with plenty of spirit and fun. As the island, though 440 {{miles north of the}} Loyalty Isles, is not to leeward of them, it would only take us about eight days more to run down, and a week more to return to it from New Zealand, than would be the case if we had our <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> on one of the Loyalty Islands. So I hope now we may get a missionary for Lifu, and so I may be free to spend all my time, when not in New Zealand, at Vanua Lava. Temperature in winter something under 80° in the shade, being in lat. 13° 45' 5". The only thing against Vanua Lava is the fact that elephantiasis abounds among the natives, and they say that the mortality is very considerable there, so it might not be desirable to bring many lads to it from other islands; but the neighbouring islands of Mota and Valua, and Uvaparapara are in sight and are certainly healthy, and our buildings are not so substantial as to cause much difficulty in shifting our quarters if necessary. The language is very hard, but when it is one's business to learn a thing, it is done after a while as a matter of course.|$|E

The Bishop dropped me here this day three months, and told me to look out for him on September 1. As New Zealand is 1,000 miles off, and he can't command winds and waves, of course I allow him a wide margin; and I begged him not to hurry over my {{important}} business in New Zealand in order to keep his appointment exactly. But his wont is to be very punctual. I have here twelve lads from the north-west islands: from seven islands, speaking six languages. The plan of bringing them to a <b>winter</b> <b>school</b> in some tropical isle is now being tried. The only difficulty here is that Lifu is so large and populous; and just now (what with French priests on it, and the most misty vague kind of teaching from Independents the only thing to oppose to the complete machinery of the Romish system) demands so much time, {{that it is difficult to}} do justice to one's lads from the distant lands that are living with one here. The Bishop had an exaggerated notion of the population here. I imagine it to be somewhere about 8,000. The language is not very hard, but has quite enough difficulty to make it more than a plaything: the people in that state when they venerate a missionary--a very dangerous state; I do my best to turn the reverence into the right channel and towards its proper object.|$|E
