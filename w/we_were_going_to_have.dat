Despite the lack of a single to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in New York City. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, [...] "people here thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> platinum records from Uncle Tupelo." ...|$|E

[...] According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "English newspaper photographers showed up when S were thrown out of the London Hilton [...] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S look, which was neither mod nor rocker." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We found that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got to throw out the script, basically.' I was devastated, and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seahawks {{head coach}} Mike Holmgren fueled the debate upon {{returning}} to Seattle, saying during a Seahawks rally, [...] "We {{knew it was}} going to be tough going up against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." [...] Al Michaels commented during a Sunday Night Football game a few months later, [...] "The fact that Holmgren was not fined for that statement speaks volumes to me." [...] Michaels explained he was alluding to Holmgren's need to [...] "blow off steam", but also suggested a perceived admission by the NFL that something went wrong in that game. Both Michaels and John Madden noted Seattle's mistakes, such as poor clock management at the end of each half.|$|E

[...] "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it," [...] said Garcia.|$|E

2500|$|Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow {{says about}} Darius' {{character}} development, [...] "It was always planned that Darius would die in [...] "The Hunters". The original plan for Darius {{was that he}} would reappear in flashbacks, much like Fitzcairn does now." [...] Stocker's illness in early 1993 prevented this. Panzer remembers that Stocker [...] "had announced that he had a brain tumor." [...] The season 1 promotional booklet recounts, [...] "Just days before going into production [...] actor Werner Stocker was stricken ill and was unable to work. By now the character of Darius had {{become an integral part of}} the story and the writers had to scramble to adjust the story line." [...] Abramowitz recalls, [...] "I got a call at three o'clock in the morning, saying Werner would not be available, we were shooting in a day and a half, and there was fear if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to shut down. I went into work, wrote twenty-five straight hours, without a break, and got out a script and the show went on and it turned out pretty well." [...] This script bears the date March 15, 1993. The production crew, too, had to adapt to the situation. The promotional booklet reports, [...] "Footage from previous episodes was successfully used to fill in for the absent actor." [...] Stocker died on May 27, 1993. The episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] are dedicated to him.|$|E
2500|$|... 1954 saw Aaron {{attending}} {{spring training}} {{with the major}} league club. Although {{he was on the}} roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, [...] "From the start, he did so well I knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to carry him." [...] On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' major league team, playing in left field and hitting a home run. This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed {{on the final day of}} spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five. On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander Joe Nuxhall. In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher Vic Raschi. [...] Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi. Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted [...]280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a [...] "lucky number" [...] for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons, and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 44.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
