60|$|It is to {{be remembered}} {{that some of the}} very best rice land will bear two crops of rice in the year. Most soil will bear two crops, the first being millet, rape, vegetables, and so on, sown on dry soil and {{ripening}} at the end of May. Then the ground is at once prepared for the <b>wet</b> <b>crop,</b> to be harvested in October or thereabouts. Land-tax is payable in two instalments. Rice land pays between the 1st November and the middle of December and the 1st January and the last of February. Other land pays between July and August and September and December. Let us see what the average yield is. The gentleman in the sun-hat and the loin-cloth would shriek at the figures, but they are approximately accurate. Rice naturally fluctuates a good deal, but it may be taken in the rough at five Japanese dollars (fifteen shillings) per koku of 330 lbs. Wheat and maize of the first spring crop is worth about eleven shillings per koku. The first crop gives nearly 1-3/4 koku per tau (the quarter acre unit of measurement aforesaid), or eighteen shillings per quarter acre, or £3:12s. per acre. The rice crop at two koku or £1:10s. the quarter acre gives £6 an acre. Total £9:12s. This is not altogether bad if you reflect that the land in question is not the very best rice land, but ordinary No. 1, at £25:16s. per acre, capital value.|$|E

40|$|Cassava is {{a crop of}} {{hope for}} the 21 st century. Great {{advantages}} of cassava over other crops are not only the capacity of carbohydrates, {{but it is also}} an easily grown crop with fast development. As a plant which is highly tolerant to a poor environment, cassava has been believed to own an effective acclimation process, an intelligent mechanism behind its sur-vival and sustainability {{in a wide range of}} climates. Herein, we aimed to investigate the tran-scriptional regulation underlying the adaptive development of a cassava root to different seasonal cultivation climates. Gene co-expression analysis suggests that AP 2 -EREBP transcription factor (ERF 1) orthologue (D 142) played a pivotal role in regulating the cellular response to exposing to wet and dry seasons. The ERF shows crosstalk with gibberellin, via ent-Kaurene synthase (D 106), in the transcriptional regulatory network that was proposed to modulate the downstream regulatory system through a distinct signaling mechanism.

The higher moisture regimes showed the greatest increase in percent crude protein with increasing nitrogen fertilizer levels. Chaff and straw values were significantly higher for the dry fallow-normal crop precipitation pattern than for normal fallow-dry crop pattern and significantly higher for the <b>wet</b> fallow-normal <b>crop</b> pattern than for normal fallow-wet crop. Percent in vitro dry matter digestibility also increased under the high moisture precipitation patterns {{and there was a}} positive relationship between fertilization level and digestibility. The digestibility values for chaff and straw were higher for the dry fallow-normal crop precipitation regime over the normal fallow-dry crop only at the higher fertilization levels. Examination of <b>wet</b> fallow-normal <b>crop</b> vs. normal fallow-wet crop showed increased digestibility for the pattern receiving more moisture in the fallow period, also at only the higher fertilization levels. This study indicated that higher moisture regimes resulted in increased straw and chaff yields.

40|$|The {{mapping of}} within-field crop yield {{variations}} offers {{a basis for}} the adjustment of input application rates to match yield potential. The aim of this project was to examine available yield mapping components and systems, and to assess the benefits that could accrue from yield mapping. The work also included site investigations of possible causes of yield reduction, and an evaluation of the potential increase in profitability from variable-rate N application. Yield mapping requires the continuous measurement of harvester position and grain yield. Accurate positioning was achieved with systems which received a remote correction signal via communications satellite. A grain flow meter in the clean grain elevator gave low errors in conditions where the deflector plate could be kept clean. The production of useful yield maps was sometimes limited by rainy weather leading to <b>wet</b> <b>crops,</b> lodging, and big variations in harvest conditions within the field. Difficulties are also presented by small, irregularly-shaped fields. The level of within-field variation in cereal yields (25 % of the field area at least 21 % below the mean) suggests that there is scope for identifying low-yielding areas and either taking corrective action or applying reduced inputs. An analysis of the results of N fertiliser trials suggests a potential gain from about £ 20 /ha in sugar beet to less than £ 10 /ha in spring barley if N application rate could be varied to apply the optimum amount to each area within a field. All the costs of application map development and variable-rate application would need to fall below these gains to justify the use of the technology. To allow further use to be made of yield maps, it is desirable that the factors responsible for yield reduction be identified, in particular those which recur each year. In the present study, soil chemical analysis and compaction affected yield in only a small proportion of cases. Differences between maps from successive years have been small. It is concluded that the immediate financial benefits from the use of this technology will be small. However, in a future where the recording, justification and minimisation of inputs such as pesticides and fertiliser will grow in significance, and where the cost of the equipment and software will continue to fall, yield mapping and variable-rate input application will find a useful role.

It estimates rice crop WP for 21 Bangladesh districts for 37 years; exploresWP variations among districts; and investigates causality involving WP, intensification and technological variables; and groundwater irrigation and depth. It breaks new grounds by probing these significant but unexplored issues. Technological diffusion was the key factor explaining inter-district WP differences. The impact of agricultural intensification on rabi (dry season) and kharif (<b>wet</b> season) <b>crop</b> WPs was positive and negative respectively. Dummy variables typifying policy transition negatively impacted on WPs for both kharif and overall crops. While rabi and kharif rice WPs grew with time, overall crop WP recorded the strongest growth. Rabi and overall WPs were lower in salinity- and drought-prone districts covering 33 % of Bangladesh's net cropped area (NCA). In 90 % of Bangladesh's NCA districts, technological diffusion caused WP. Causality existed between groundwater irrigation and depth in 60 % NCA. Despite significant potential to increaseWP, increasing dependence on groundwater appears unsustainable. Widespread diffusion of HYVs in the kharif season, and development of salinity and drought-tolerant rice varieties could {{go a long way}} in sustaining rice WP...|$|R
40|$|Methane {{emissions}} from Philippine rice paddies, fertilized with either urea or green manure, were monitored {{for several weeks}} after harvesting the dry and the <b>wet</b> season <b>crops</b> of 1992. The fields were still flooded during harvest but irrigation was stopped after harvest and the fields were allowed to evaporatively dry while CH 4 emissions were monitored with a closed chamber technique. In all plots we observed a sudden, strong increase of CH 4 emissions to the atmosphere for 2 to 4 days just after the soil fell dry. As soil drying continued, the soils began to crack and CH 4 emissions decreased to nil. The release of CH 4 during soil drying was observed for fields on three different soil types and both for urea or organically manured rice fields in both seasons. The absolute amounts of CH 4 emitted during soil drying differed greatly depending on fertilizer treatment. However, the ratio {{between the amount of}} CH 4 released upon soil drying and CH 4 emitted during die growing season was quite c onstant (0. 10 ¤ 0. 04). This suggests that about 10 per cent of the CH 4 emitted during a full rice crop cycle is released during drying of the fields and thus needs to be included in estimates of the total CH 4 emission from rice agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of early}} and late-maturing {{varieties}} of rice {{on the population}} growth of N. virescens was investigated during the <b>wet</b> season <b>crop</b> of 1994 / 1995, and dry season crop of 1995 in the experimental fields of Research lnstitute for Rice in Sukamandi. A pot experiment to observe oviposition rate of N. virescens on both varieties was conducted in screen house in the dry season crop of 1995. The population fluctuation of N. virescens on both varieties as well as number of eggs {{of the first generation}} at 8 weeks after transplanting were similar. The population density increased during early growth stage of rice from immigrant generation to the first generation and decreased thereafter. The peak emergence of adults of the first generation on early maturing variety occured after the flowering stage, on the otherhand on late maturing variety the peak emergence of adults occured before the flowering stage. Adult N. virescens laid more eggs on early maturing variety after flowering stage than that on late maturing variety before flowering stage (p< 0. 01; t-test) in the pot experiment. Those field and pot experiment facts indicated that the first generation of adult emigrant influenced the population fluctuation in the fields, because the density of predator, Lycosa, was lower in the early maturing variety than in the late maturing variety in the wet season crop of 1994 / 1995 and it was similar in the dry season crop of 1995...|$|R
