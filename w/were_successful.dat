5|$|Although the Giants <b>were</b> <b>successful</b> on {{the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their {{financial}} status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September <b>were</b> <b>successful,</b> over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions.

The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and <b>were</b> <b>successful</b> in negotiating a ceasefire.

However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
