Passing very near Socorro Island on June21, Adrian produced peak winds of 45mph (72km/h) there, potentially damaging <b>weather</b> <b>monitoring</b> equipment. Along the southern coastline of Chiapas, four people were swept away and drowned {{by a large}} wave, while farther inland in northwestern Durango, two men died and a five-year-old girl went missing after attempting to cross a river in a pick-up truck. Along the central coastline of Michoacán, a powerful hailstorm demolished many homes and left around 2,000 people homeless. A 1.2mi (2km) stretch of coastal road was ruined {{in the city of}} Tecomán. The outer bands of the hurricane produced heavy rainfall peaking at 15.75in (400mm) in the municipality of Coyutla; minor flooding was reported across Coahuila and Colima.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand's {{armed forces}} have been {{involved}} in Antarctic research and exploration since the 1950s. The Air Force operated two Auster T7 and a Beaver in Antarctica in the late 1950s, the Austers somewhat unsuccessfully. The navy has escorted supply ships and conducted its own supply missions, provided <b>weather</b> <b>monitoring</b> and support for U.S. activities in the 'frozen continent', conducted scientific research, and helped build Scott Base. In 1964, 40 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force, was re-equipped with the C-130H Hercules and, the following year, commenced regular flights to and from the Antarctic. The army, and later the other two services, have provided cargo handlers. No. 5 Squadron has operated in the airspace over and near Scott Base to provide search and rescue standby and to drop mail and medical supplies to the people wintering over.|$|E

As part of its [...] 9,200-million modernisation plan, the Department of Meteorology plans to install Doppler Weather Radar in Chennai.

The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai will install an automatic weather unit at Meenambakkam in 2011 {{as part of its}} modernisation project, which aims to improve <b>weather</b> <b>monitoring</b> facilities. The department set up two more in the suburbs of Madhavaram and Ennore recently. With the new automated weather stations to be installed, the state of Tamil Nadu would have 42 such facilities.|$|E

Years later he was to admit [...] "When I think back I wonder how I {{had the nerve to}} do it." [...] The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing a huge amount of data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space <b>weather</b> <b>monitoring</b> of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
