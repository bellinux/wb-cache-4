5|$|Gord Downie {{released}} Secret Path in October 2016, {{a concept}} album about Chanie Wenjack's escape and death. It {{was accompanied by}} a graphic novel and animated film, aired on CBC Television. All proceeds go to the University of Manitoba's Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie's brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the material in their classrooms, and hoped to continue this.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} mediaeval {{medicine}} started roughly {{around the year}} 1000 with the {{school of medicine in}} Salerno, which combined elements of Latin, Greek, Arabic and Jewish medicine. Galen and Dioscorides (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also Arabic physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.|$|E
5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit {{their love}} for each other, yet he distrusts her {{intentions}} (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the process to separate gases.|$|E

5|$|Goudsmit interviewed Joliot-Curie in Paris on 27 August. Accompanied by Calvert, Joliot-Curie {{was flown}} to London where Perrin and Goudsmit interviewed {{him about the}} {{activities}} of German scientists. Joliot-Curie recalled visits to the College, which had a cyclotron, by German scientists including Erich Schumann, who had initiated the German nuclear project, and controlled it until it had been {{handed over to the}} Reichsforschungsrat (National Research Council) in 1942; by Abraham Esau, who had been in charge of nuclear physics under the Reichsforschungsrat; and by Walter Gerlach, who had replaced him in January 1944. Other German physicists <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the facilities included Kurt Diebner, Walther Bothe, and Erich Bagge, all of whom were known {{to be associated with the}} German nuclear project.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Louis Cormier, who {{was given}} the ring name Rudy Kay because he resembled a retired wrestler <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the same name, {{spent much of his}} career {{balancing}} his roles as promoter and wrestler. He helped found the ESA in 1969 and operated shows under the title International Wrestling (IW). He won five tag team championships while teaming with The Beast and held two titles as a singles wrestler. He retired from active competition in 1982 and died of septicemia on May 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{intentions}} were anticipated by the Spanish. According to Joseph de La Pise, a French jurist hired by Maurice's half brother and successor Frederick Henry {{to write a}} history of the Princes of Orange, Mondragón had learned of the ambush from English soldiers who had deserted from the Dutch colours, but the Italian Jesuit Angello Gallucci claims that it was Spanish spies who informed Mondragón, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> spies to gather information on the enemy since the siege of Zierikzee, in 1576. In any case, the Spanish general took measures to turn Nassau's surprise into a trap. The convoy, normally guarded by 300 infantry and 150 cavalry, was reinforced by 300 musketeers and a large force of cavalry under Mondragón's lieutenant, Juan de Córdoba.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna {{as a witness}} to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E

5|$|Two {{people were}} arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one was a male {{permanent}} resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> the other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|Using mobile-phone {{tracking}} techniques, {{police were}} able to trace <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> cell phones near {{the scene of the}} disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club {{around the time of the}} disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E
