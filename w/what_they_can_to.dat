Once there, the party gets into a battle with minions of the Warlock Lord and find that the Sword of Shannara has already been removed.

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{consider}} Moonraker {{one of the}} lesser films in the series, {{largely due to the}} extent of the plot which takes James Bond into space, some of the ploys used in the film for comedic effect, and its extended dialogue. In November 2006, Entertainment Weekly ranked Moonraker fourteenth among the Bond films, describing it as [...] "by far the campiest of all 007 movies" [...] with [...] "one of the worst theme songs"; while IGN listed it as eleventh, calling it outlandish and saying that despite the actors [...] "trying <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> ground the film in reality, the laser gun/space station finale pretty much undercuts their efforts"; and Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the fourth worst film of the series, considering that the film [...] "just flat-out sucks".|$|E

Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> help them.|$|E

Mill said, [...] "As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." [...] Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. [...] "What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them."

Then Sam graduates from college, and all the boys, with some others, go on a long automobile tour, during which a number of exciting adventures occur.

Some are so silly and so blind as quite to forget and look over the pardon of sin, and to lay their happiness in some external amendments, when, alas! poor wretches as they are, they abide under the wrath of God. Or if they be not quite so foolish as utterly to forget the forgiveness of sin, yet they think of it but in the second place; they are for setting of sanctification before justification, and so seek to confound the order of God; and that which is worse unto them, they by so doing do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> keep themselves indeed from being sharers in that great blessing of forgiveness of sins by grace.|$|E

60|$|We {{lived as}} merrily and as happily after this {{as could be}} expected, {{considering}} our circumstances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, &c.; and as to that, my gentleman had not the least concern about him for it.
