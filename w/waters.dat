5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate <b>waters</b> than in tropical <b>waters,</b> possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical <b>waters.</b> Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar <b>waters</b> and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor <b>waters</b> with the minimum of effort.

5|$|In 1982, <b>Waters</b> {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, <b>Waters</b> changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between <b>Waters</b> and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. <b>Waters</b> felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. <b>Waters</b> and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what <b>Waters</b> felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} North Atlantic, {{porbeagle}} fishing has been illegal in <b>waters</b> of the European Union since 2011. From 1985 {{and until the}} EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons respectively from European Community <b>waters.</b> Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch {{in the region and}} thus had no practical effect.

40|$|<b>Water</b> {{reclamation}} and reuse {{provides a}} unique and viable opportunity to augment traditional <b>water</b> supplies. As a multi-disciplined and important element of <b>water</b> resources development and management, <b>water</b> reuse can help to close the loop between <b>water</b> supply and wastewater disposal. Effective <b>water</b> reuse requires integration of <b>water</b> and reclaimed <b>water</b> supply functions. The successful development of this dependable <b>water</b> resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and <b>water</b> utility management. In this paper, fundamental concepts of <b>water</b> reuse are discussed including definitions, historical developments, the role of <b>water</b> recycling in the hydrologic cycle, categories of <b>water</b> reuse, <b>water</b> quality criteria and regulatory requirements, and technological innovations for the safe use of reclaimed <b>water.</b> The paper emphasizes the integration of this alternative <b>water</b> supply into <b>water</b> resources planning {{and the emergence of}} modern <b>water</b> reclamation and reuse practices from wastewater to reclaimed <b>water</b> to repurified <b>water...</b>|$|R

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road.

5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot <b>water.</b> Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot <b>water</b> temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot <b>water</b> line siphoning in open-loop hot <b>water</b> circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> line to return <b>water</b> back to the <b>water</b> heater. Hot <b>Water</b> Line Siphoning occurs when <b>water</b> from within the hot <b>water</b> line siphons or is forced into the cold <b>water</b> line due to differences in <b>water</b> pressure between the hot and cold <b>water</b> lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot <b>water</b> out of hot <b>water</b> lines during cold <b>water</b> use. Using cold <b>water</b> instantly lowers the <b>water</b> pressure in the cold <b>water</b> lines, the higher <b>water</b> pressure in the hot <b>water</b> lines force <b>water</b> through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover valves and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold <b>water</b> from flowing into hot <b>water</b> line), increasing the energy demand on the <b>water</b> heater.|$|R

40|$|Although <b>water</b> {{supply systems}} include {{activities}} such as <b>water</b> intake; <b>water</b> purification; and <b>water</b> distribution, many <b>water</b> supply organizations are not always equipped with all three activities. In fact, Japan has two types of <b>water</b> companies: one that operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification (type 1); and the other which mainly operates <b>water</b> distribution (type 2). Many previous studies have attempted to identify scale economies for <b>water</b> supply organizations, but have failed {{to take into account}} which <b>water</b> supply systems operate. In this analysis we categorize Japanese <b>water</b> supply organizations into three types: type 1 - which operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; type 2 a - which not only operates <b>water</b> distribution, but also operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; and type 2 b - which operates <b>water</b> distribution, but purchases <b>water</b> from type 1 companies. After that, we estimate scale economies for each type of <b>water</b> supply organization using translog cost function. Furthermore, we take into account their <b>water</b> sources, especially type 1 and type 2 a, because we consider that differences of <b>water</b> sources might affect the cost structure of <b>water</b> supply systems. ...|$|R

Mason declined, but contacted <b>Waters</b> who was immediately enthusiastic. <b>Waters</b> then called Geldof to discuss the event, scheduled to take place in one month. About two weeks later <b>Waters</b> called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day the latter agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed.
