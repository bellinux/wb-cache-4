40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana. The studied association represents a stratigraphic link between the Tithonian records of Steinmanella from the Picún Leufú Formation and the Late Valanginian to Hauterivian records from the Agrio Formation.

The occurrence of ILC 2 s is more frequent {{in the blood of}} subjects with allergic asthma than in healthy individuals and allergic donors. When stimulated with IL- 25 or IL- 33, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with allergic asthma produced significantly greater amounts of IL- 5 and IL- 13 than those from patients with allergic rhinitis and those from healthy donors (Bartemes et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016). Recently, ILC 2 s were found in the bronchoalvoelar lavage (BAL) and sputum of patients with asthma, and the proportion of IL- 5 +IL- 13 + ILC 2 s in the sputum of patients with severe asthma was higher than that in corresponding samples from patients with mild asthma (Smith et al., 2016).

40|$|It {{is almost}} 50 {{years since the}} first UK studies {{identified}} potentially preventable factors {{in the majority of}} asthma deaths. 1 Those first reports {{led to the development of}} national asthma guidelines, intended to radically improve management.

With the development of new doctor–patient partnerships in the form of personalised self-management plans and newer drugs with innovative delivery systems, improving asthma care in the future seemed a certainty. And yet, from 1992, the only ongoing inquiry into asthma death in the East of England fuelled background concern that prevent-able death was still a major issue. 3 That concern was highlighted by the National Atlas of Variation in Healthcare for Respiratory Disease, 4 published in September 2012, which showed great variation in almost every facet of asthma care delivery across the UK. The National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) was a confidential enquiry that investigated in detail 900 deaths of people of all ages who had died in 2012 with an ICD- 10 code J 459, where the underlying cause of death was classified as asthma.

Data were analyzed by utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). A total of five hypotheses were tested using Chi-Squared Fisher s Exact test to compare caregivers with asthma and caregivers without asthma in relationship to (a) taking their children to a primary care physician, (b) taking their children to an asthma educator, (c) identifying asthma triggers in the home setting, (d) knowing how often their children should use a rescue inhaler, and (e) knowing how often their children should use a controller medicine. The study suggested there were no statistical differences between caregivers with asthma and caregivers without asthma in regard to taking their children to visit a primary care physician, asthma educator, or knowing how often their children should use a rescue inhaler.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of asthma is usually estimated {{on the basis}} of the results of questionnaires. A comparison with prevalence according to medical records has not been reported before. Adherence to medical advice and prescriptions are generally poor in chronic diseases like asthma. There is a lack of intervention studies to improve adherence. Aims: 1 : To perform an epidemiological analysis of the asthma prevalence and the use of the healthcare system in a Swedish region. 2 : To compare the parental assessment of children <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> according to a questionnaire with physicians diagnosed asthma. 3 : To perform an intervention with additional information and support to parents of preschool children with newly diagnosed asthma in order to improve adherence. 4 : To evaluate the effects on quality of life and separately analyze the answers of the mothers and the fathers. 5 : To analyze any remaining intervention effects after 6 years. Methods: Firstly, all outpatient clinics had computerised patient records and thus these visits could be studied as well as admissions to hospital for asthma. In 1999 a questionnaire was answered by 75 % of the parents of 6 295 children 1 - 6 years of age. Secondly, a controlled, prospective intervention study where the parents of 60 children were randomised to either a control group (CG) or to an intervention group (IG) which had group meetings in close connection to the diagnosis. Outcome was measured by questionnaires and by classification of the children according to clinical examination, blood tests, symptoms and medication. Adherence rate was calculated with the help of diaries and weighing the inhalers used. Fathers and mothers answered separately the Paediatric Caregiver s Quality of Life Questionnaire. Children were followed up after 6 years and objective measurements of lung function were added to the other parameters. Results: The burden of asthma was mainly handled by the outpatient clinics. According to the parental questionnaire 5. 9 % had asthma in 1999, according to the medical records 4. 9 %. With register diagnosis as gold standard the sensitivity of the questionnaire was 77 %. The questionnaire identified half of the children with a medical record of asthma. Forty percent of the children claimed by their parents to be asthmatic had no medical record of asthma. One third of the children with newly diagnosed asthma had risk of developing persistent asthma. The intervention resulted in an improvement of the parents view on adherence issues and on adherence per se. The children in the IG had less exacerbation days despite having lower inhaled steroid doses. There were no major gender differences in indices of quality of life, but according to individual questions mothers were more affected by their children <b>s</b> <b>asthma.</b> After 6 months the mothers in the IG showed improvements in all indices. At the 6 year follow-up 71 % still had asthma. The IG had fewer contacts with nurses than the CG and they had lower inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses. The IG parents still had a more positive view on adherence questions and their quality of life was better. The children who were older than 2 years of age at inclusion had a higher risk of developing persistent asthma. Intermittent ICS was used by 81 %. The lung function was preserved. The burden on the health care system was low. Hospital admittances due to asthma in the region are the lowest in the country. Conclusions: A parentally completed questionnaire provided an acceptable estimation of the {{prevalence of}} asthma in children 2 - 6 years of age compared to asthma registered in medical records although in half of the cases the individual child was not identified. Straightforward and timely information to parents of children with asthma has long-term positive effects which can be mediated through equalization of the parent s roles in handling their child <b>s</b> <b>asthma.</b> The hospital admissions due to asthma are very few, possibly as a result of the intervention and improved medical care in the paediatric outpatient clinics. Asthma diagnosed before age 2 has a better prognosis. Most children with a high risk of persistent asthma can be successfully treated with intermittent ICS...|$|R

In an attempt to increase understanding {{of the factors that}} may influence self-management of chronic disease, this study examined the relationship between asthma self-efficacy belief and asthma self-management in urban African American children. The study, using a descriptive correlational design, surveyed 81 urban African American children age 7 - 12 years old with self reported asthma. The relationship among asthma self-efficacy and asthma self-management was explored using the Asthma Belief Survey and Asthma Inventory Control survey.

The best characterized costimulatory recepto r expressed on resting T cells is CD 28 which provides poorly-defined cyclosporin-resistant biochemical signal(s) that promote expres-sion of several cytokines/chemokines. Another major effect of CD 28 ligation is the promotio n of cell survival w hich is thought to occur via the up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression. CD 28 shares its ligands B 7. 1 and B 7. 2 with t he related CTLA- 4, which plays an inhibitory role in T cell activation. Manipulation of CD 28 /CTLA- 4 interac-t ions with their natural ligands has provided exciting results in transplantation and tumor therapy settings and a lso has potential {{in the treatment of}} several diseases such as arthritis and multiple sclerosi <b>s,</b> <b>asthma</b> and protection a gainst HIV infection.

The {{version of}} record is {{available}} online at: [URL] {{aim of this}} study was to use in vitro nail models to investigate the potential of a novel base formulation (Recura) containing either fluconazole or miconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis in comparison to two commercial comparators (Jublia and a Penlac generic). Initially, a modified Franz cell was used, where sections of human nail served as the barrier through which drug penetrated into an agar-filled chamber infected with dermatophytes. A second study was performed using a novel infected nail model where dermatophytes grew into human nail and adenosine triphosphate levels were used as biological marker for antimicrobial activity. The novel enhancing system Recura increased the permeation of both existing drugs through human nail sections mounted in a modified Franz cell. Furthermore, the infected nail model also confirmed that the system also enhanced the permeation through infected nail resulting in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels superior (P ??? 0. 05) to Penlac generic and equivalent (P > 0. 05) to the commercial comparator Jublia. This study demonstrated that with the use of a novel permeation-enhancing formulation base, Recura enhances delivery of miconazole and fluconazole when applied ungually such that the efficacy was equivalent or superior to commercial comparators.

Methods: An asthma educational intervention program entitled "School Asthma Action Program" (SAAP) was designed based on pedagogical principles and implemented among teachers randomly selected from girls 2 ̆ 7 primary schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This pilot study employed a pre-test/post-test experimental design. A previously tested asthma awareness questionnaire and a custom-designed asthma competence score sheet were used to evaluate the effects of the educational intervention program on teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> awareness and competence in providing asthma-related first aid interventions at schools. Results: Forty-seven teachers from five different primary schools participated in the program. Of the 47 teachers, 39 completed both the pre- and post-program questionnaires.
