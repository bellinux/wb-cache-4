A total of 420 rods and 10 thermocouple fuel rods containing plutonium- 1. 25 wt% aluminum fuel slugs were made. In addition, 120 blanket rods and 5 thermocouple rods were assembled with depleted uranium slugs. Both the fissile and fertile slugs were NaK bonded in Zircaloy- 2 jacket tubes. The fuel alloy was made by induction melting plutonium and aluminum. The centrifugal casting technique developed for EBR-I, Core-II was tried without success with this alloy. The gas pressure injection casting method developed for the EBR-II fuel cycle was used to cast the Core-IV rods. These were parted into rough slugs which were roll-sized and coined to final shape. After coining, the slugs were heat-treated and inspected. A loading technique was developed to protect {{the outside of the}} jacket tube and the weld zone from plutonium contamination. A connector fitting, <b>with</b> an <b>integral</b> <b>tube</b> for NaK filling, was welded {{to the top of the}} jacket tube. A measured quantity of NaK was injected through the fill opening by a hypodermic needle and syringe. The filling tube was then welded closed by the capacitor-discharge technique. The rods were then heat treated, leak detected, eddy-current bond inspected, x-rayed for NaK level, and gaged. All rods were surveyed for alpha contamination of the external surfaces and were shipped in approved birdcages to the reactor site. (auth...|$|R

40|$|Extremely lightweight, compact, noninvasive, rugged, {{relatively}} inexpensive strain-gauge transducers {{have been developed}} for use in measuring pressures of fluids in tubes. These gauges were originally intended for measuring pressures of spacecraft-propulsion fluids, but they are also attractive for use in numerous terrestrial applications especially those involving fluids that are extremely chemically reactive, fluids that must be isolated for hygienic purposes, fluids that must be allowed to flow without obstruction, and fluid-containing tubes exposed to severe environments. A basic pressure transducer of this type comprises one or more pair(s) of thin-film strain gauges <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> a <b>tube</b> that contains the fluid of interest. Following established strain-gauge practice, the gauges in each pair are connected into opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge (see figure). Typically, each pressure transducer includes one pair (the active pair) of strain gauges for measuring the hoop stress proportional to the pressure of the fluid in the tube and another pair (the dummy pair) of strain gauges that are nominally unstrained: The dummy gauges are mounted on a substrate that is made of the same material as that of the tube. The substrate is welded to the tube at only one spot so that stresses and strains are not coupled from the tube into the substrate. The dummy strain gauges measure neutral strains (basically, strains associated with thermal expansion), so that the neutral-strain contribution can be subtracted out of the final gauge reading...|$|R

The original Chrysler design of two large valves per cylinder is used. The intake valve is made from solid titanium and the exhaust from solid Nimonic 80A or similar. Seats are of ductile iron. Beryllium-copper has been tried but its use is limited due to it's toxicity. Valve sizes are around 2.45 in for the intake and 1.925 in for the exhaust.
