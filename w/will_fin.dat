30|$|A novel {{actuating}} material, {{which is}} lightweight, soft, {{and capable of}} generating large flapping motion under electrical stimuli, is highly desirable to build energy-efficient and maneuverable bio-inspired underwater robots. Ionic polymer–metal composites are important category of electroactive polymers, since they can generate large bending motions under low actuation voltages. IPMCs are ideal artificial muscles for small-scale and bio-inspired robots. This paper takes a system perspective to review the recent work on IPMC-enabled underwater robots, from modeling, fabrication, and bio-inspired design perspectives. First, a physics-based and control-oriented model of IPMC actuator will be reviewed. Second, a bio-inspired robotic fish propelled by IPMC caudal <b>fin</b> <b>will</b> be presented and a steady-state speed model of the fish will be demonstrated. Third, a novel fabrication process for 3 D actuating membrane will be introduced and a bio-inspired robotic manta ray propelled by two IPMC pectoral <b>fins</b> <b>will</b> be demonstrated. Fourth, a 2 D maneuverable robotic fish propelled by multiple IPMC <b>fin</b> <b>will</b> be presented. Last, advantages and challenges of using IPMC artificial muscles in bio-inspired robots will be concluded.|$|R
40|$|Network {{glasses are}} the {{physical}} prototype for many self-organized systems, ranging from proteins to computer science. Conventional theories of gases, liquids and crystals do {{not account for}} the strongly material-selective character of the glass-forming tendency, the phase diagrams of glasses or their optimizable properties. A new topological theory, only 25 years old, has succeeded where conventional theories have failed. It shows that (probably all slowly quenched) glasses, including network glasses, are the result of the combined effects of a few simple mechanisms. These glass-forming mechanisms are topological in nature and have already been identified for several important glasses, including chalcogenide alloys, silicates (window glass and computer chips) and proteins. ‘Some four thousand years ago man discovered glass in the embers of a fire built somewhere in the deserts of the Near East.

40|$|Wayne Wu’s Attention (2014) is a perspicuous, thorough, and even-handed {{survey of}} current views of {{attention}} in mainstream philosophy and cogni-tive science. That last qualifying phrase is important: readers looking for a more comprehensive historical, philosophical, or scientific treatment may be disappointed, as {{the bulk of the}} literature discussed by Wu comes from analytic philosophy of the past twenty years, and all debates are framed by a standard computational and representationalist approach (see pp. 42, 46 – 50). This means, for example, no contributions from the conti-nental phenomenological tradition (e. g. Husserl), no mention of alterna-tive, non-representational theoretical frameworks such as ecological psy-chology (Chemero 2009), and very little attention to new scientific research on attention and neural synchronization (Aboitiz and Cosmelli 2009). But what Wu covers, he covers very well, and he is admirably straightforward about the unsettled issues of attention research. His clear-cut analyses of empirical and theoretical issues leave the door wide open to other ap-proaches, so that even readers who disagree with his approach <b>will</b> <b>fin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Skeletal muscle is, {{in terms}} of volume, the most {{abundant}} tissue in the vertebrate body. It exerts {{a key role in}} controlling several physiological functions such as driving locomotion, maintaining body temperature, and hosting {{a significant portion of the}} metabolic activity. Myofibers are the primary unit of all skeletal muscles, and they are specialized multinucleated syncytial structures that express a specific array of proteins necessary for muscle contraction. Myofibers are formed during development as consequence of the proliferative growth and fusion of myogenic progenitors, or myoblasts. Similarly to the hematopoietic system, skeletal muscle is formed in subsequent phases of myogenesis involving different stages of myogenic progenitors [1]. Nevertheless, not all myogenic progenitors terminally differentiate during development; a fraction of cells with myogenic potential is maintained in a primitive state in the adult organism to serve as muscle stem cells [2]. These cells can be activated in response to tissue damage or further growth demands to execute the myogenic program and contribute to muscle growth and regeneration.

40|$|We study {{proximity}} effects at ferromagnet superconductor interfaces by self-consistent {{numerical solution}} of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the continuum, without any approximations. Our procedures allow us to study systems with long superconducting coherence lengths. We obtain results for the pair potential, the pair amplitude, and the local density of states. We use these results to extract the relevant proximity lengths. We find that the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet exhibit a damped oscillatory behavior that is reflected in both the pair amplitude and the local density of states. The characteristic length scale of these oscillations is approximately inversely proportional to the exchange field, and is independent of the superconducting coherence length in the range studied. We find the superconducting coherence length to be nearly independent of the ferromagnetic polarization. Comment: 13 Pages total.

50|$|Fertile lemon tetra eggs take {{approximately}} 72 {{hours to}} hatch at 28 °C. The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. After 7 days, the fry {{should be ready}} to feed upon newly hatched Brine Shrimp. The fry appear to be almost transparent at first, {{with the exception of the}} eyes, and do not begin to develop the 'lozenge' shape of the adult body until the differentiation of the finfold into the unpaired fins is complete (around 4-6 weeks). Once this process is complete, the fishes are ready to take sifted Daphnia. Maintenance temperature for the fry should be carefully and slowly reduced to around 25 °C once the fishes are thus recognisably miniature versions of the adults. The first signs of black colouration on the unpaired fins may take a further two weeks of more to being manifesting themselves, and it will not be until the fishes are at least 12 weeks old that they will fully represent miniature versions of the parents. Even at this stage, the black colouration of the unpaired <b>fins</b> <b>will</b> be incompletely developed, and it will not be until sexual maturity is achieved (approximately 8 to 9 months after hatching) that the black border on the anal <b>fin</b> <b>will</b> become a reliable gender differentiation characteristic.|$|R
