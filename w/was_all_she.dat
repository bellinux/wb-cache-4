500|$|Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout said, [...] "the way {{in which}} [...] {{continually}} addresses Britney Spears just seems the least bit odd", but commented on how pleasant the song is. A review by Idolator noticed [...] "Britney" [...] has [...] "a melody that dares to be clear and pretty in ways emo bands [...] don’t usually dare," [...] and commented how the song's [...] "strongly sung" [...] lyrics are [...] "sweet [...] not cynical at all." [...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to say to}} her daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She wanted to know how much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{said that}} they are hoping for success like fellow British artists, One Direction, Adele, Cher Lloyd, the Wanted and Emeli Sandé have enjoyed. It was {{revealed}} by Perez Hilton that the band had been working with Demi Lovato in the recording studio. It was revealed that Sean Paul would feature on the album. When the band were introducing themselves to the American public, Rochelle Humes said she was the [...] "mum of the group", they call Mollie King the [...] "Disney characters" [...] although she said [...] "I'm not. I don't think life's a fairy tale, but I do {{like to see the}} good in situations." [...] Vanessa White revealed she loved to party: [...] "I love going out. I don't enjoy the hangovers the next day, but it hasn't stopped me yet." [...] Frankie Sandford said they the music industry <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> knew as she had been in the industry since she was a child in band, S Club 8, along with Humes. Where as Una Healy introduced herself along with her daughter Aoife Belle and husband, Ben Foden. The band said that the album would be [...] "obviously the Sats sound" [...] Sandford said that the album would be Dancey and upbeat but would ultimately be pop. King revealed that the band had written most of the songs on the album, which they were most excited about. The band {{said that they}} would like to bring [...] "girl power" [...] back to the US like the Spice Girls did. King said: [...] "Since the Spice Girls there hasn't been a British girlband to make it in the US, it would be nice for us to bring a little girl power into the scene." [...] However, fellow girl group Little Mix's debut album, DNA, set new records for a British girl group in the US in June 2013. Healy said she was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] with the people she has got the chance to work with on the album.|$|E

60|$|The lady {{broke into}} a smile as she turned her eyes upon him. 'Indeed?' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> answered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, {{how is it}} {{that man}} has so fascinated me?' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could think. Her own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could see. Her gait was constrained, from the {{knowledge}} that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees.|$|E
60|$|Violet, {{still very}} weak, {{could have been}} hysterical, but luckily was able to command herself, though, 'thank you!' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if hotel fires <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>she's</b> got {{to depend}} on to keep up her name, it's a pretty {{precarious}} kind of a reputation I should think." ...|$|R
60|$|A few shillings now and then, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could earn. The boy worked {{steadily}} on; dying by minutes, {{but never}} once giving utterance to complaint or murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... "A hunk of {{beef and}} plenty of {{blankets}} and flannel <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> can use; but first let's find the mine. We can quarrel over its division afterward." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary {{could not}} help being {{diverted}} at this moral deduced from the pig-story. 'Every one is fond of him,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said.|$|E
6000|$|She {{accepted}} his reproaches with unshaken resignation. [...] "I have deserved it!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said to herself, [...] "I have deserved it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{look him}} up I did, two years afterward. He <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said--solid and stolid, the Ox--shuffling around and {{waiting on the}} tables.|$|E
6000|$|... "Encouragement <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> wants, ma'am. Take my {{word for}} it, this matter rests entirely with you. It's all in a nutshell. Encourage her to confide in you--and she will confide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is {{so lovely}} I don't know what to say!" [...] and Jill put up both arms, as words failed her, and {{grateful}} kisses <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had to offer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welcome {{is not to}} be bought,' said James. 'I {{could not}} stand hearing him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his riches and his Cheveleigh, as if that <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could prize.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Robin, Robin!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said, but in {{her voice}} throbbed a world of passionate longing, an {{exquisite}} blend of delight and pain.|$|E
60|$|Edith was sobbing. A few broken {{sentences}} had <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{capable of}} {{in the way of}} a funeral service, and now her husband was compelled to half-carry her back to the cabin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it is {{a pitiful}} case; and easily mended, since Fay is so eager about it. Hope the lad <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> says, and nothing {{catching}} about his illness. Nanna can tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, {{for that}} dowdy tarlaton <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> has got. She may tear it tonight, {{and that will}} be a good excuse for {{offering}} a decent one." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Una. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said, {{but there}} was {{something}} in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|That {{is quite}} enough for her. That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> wanted to know. She merely asked {{in case there}} might be. As it appears there is, she re- settles herself {{in her chair and}} <b>is</b> again <b>all</b> ears.|$|R
6000|$|COMTESSE. And you are about, as I understand, to {{introduce}} a bill to give women an equal right with men to grow beards [which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> knows about it. He takes the remark literally.] ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} had <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> asked for. In {{a few minutes}} she turned toward them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more; her eyes rested softly on Horace as she went on.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rolland's bushy eyebrows frowned in stern {{disapproval of}} the new topic of conversation. 'I regret to hear it, my lady,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said.|$|E
