5|$|After his {{interview}} with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for custody of Kate, who had been taken in by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be supervised.|$|E
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} and marital practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, {{in sharp contrast to}} Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E

5|$|Each {{team had}} progressed through five rounds {{to reach the}} final, having each entered in the third round. Both teams {{required}} a single replay in different rounds to progress, but otherwise won each of their games. In the fifth round, Cardiff knocked the reigning champions, Bolton Wanderers out of the cup. Both teams had a mixture of home and away games on their route to the final, but Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> play outside London after the initial fourth round match. By the quarter-finals, the two teams were the only Football League Division One teams left in the competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded {{for more than one}} year.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments.

5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 {{for the one}} in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to.</b> There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E
5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in the}} cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of archbishop was usually {{held by a}} scion of nobility, and not necessarily a priest; this widespread practice allowed younger sons of noble houses to find prestigious and financially secure positions without the requirements of priesthood. The archbishop and prince-elector was chosen by the cathedral chapter, the members of which also served as his advisers. As members of a cathedral chapter, they participated in the Mass, or sang the Mass; in addition, they performed other duties as needed. They <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be priests but they could, if they wished, take Holy Orders. As prebendaries, they received stipends from cathedral income; depending on the location and wealth of the cathedral, this could amount to substantial annual income. In the Electorate, the Chapter included 24canons of various social ranks; they each had {{a place in the}} choir, based on their rank, which in turn was usually derived from the social standing of their families.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|William was famously {{biased against}} the Knights Templar, whom he {{believed}} to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the Siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.|$|E
5|$|Most Lithuanian Jews {{perished in}} the first phase during the first months of the {{occupation}} and before the end of 1941. The first recorded action of the Einsatzgruppen (Einsatzgruppe A) took place on June 22, 1941, in the border town of Gargzdai (called Gorzdt in Yiddish and Garsden in German), {{which was one of the}} oldest Jewish settlements in the country and only 18 kilometres (11mi) from German-annexed Memel. Approximately 800 Jews were shot that day in what is known as the Garsden Massacre. Approximately 100 non-Jewish Lithuanians were also executed, many for trying to aid their Jewish neighbors. About80,000 Jews were killed by October and about175,000 by the end of the year. The majority of Jews in Lithuania <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> live in ghettos nor sent to the Nazi concentration camps which at that time were just in the preliminary stages of operation. Instead they were shot in pits near their places of residence with the most infamous mass murders taking place in the Ninth Fort near Kaunas and the Ponary Forest near Vilnius. By 1942 about 45,000Jews survived, largely those who had been sent to ghettos and camps. In the second phase, the Holocaust slowed, as Germans decided to use the Jews as forced labor to fuel the German war economy. In the third phase, the destruction of Jews was again given a high priority; it was in that phase that the remaining ghettos and camps were liquidated.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{does not}} track medalists in Olympic art {{competitions}} in its database {{and thus the}} prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win {{more than one in}} a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem Ode to Sport under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, {{as if it were a}} joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} security would {{come with a}} larger population, {{but was unable to}} attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of the adults in Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was a high percentage of widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men and women of mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed as whites. Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> convert to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
