5|$|At Castle Brunwald, Indy rescues Henry, but {{learns that}} Elsa and Donovan are {{actually}} {{working with the}} Nazis, and are using him to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in Hatay, while <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> Sallah for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from Castle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three booby traps and his diary contains the clues to guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin. They then board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but the Nazis soon discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a parasite biplane. They crash while engaging in a dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
5|$|One {{consignment}} of 250 copies {{was stopped}} at Dover. Then the Chairman of the Board of Customs balked. He had read The Well and {{considered it a}} fine book, not at all obscene; he {{wanted no part of}} suppressing it. On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E

5|$|Felicia {{takes in}} Paul's son, Zach (Cody Kasch), informing him that Paul {{will not be}} returning. Zach violently attacks Felicia, forcing her to reveal that Mike has taken Paul away to kill him. Later that day, Susan goes to Mike's house to feed his dog and discovers Zach <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> a gun. He holds Susan hostage and {{explains}} his plan to kill Mike when he returns home. Meanwhile, Mike takes Paul to a desert and coerces him into explaining the truth behind Dierdre's death. Paul explains that twelve years earlier, Dierdre, a drug addict, sold Mary Alice and Paul her baby. The couple relocate to Wisteria Lane to avoid the discovery of their crime. Sometime later, a sober Dierdre finally tracked down the Young family and attempted to take her son back. Mary Alice stabbed and killed Dierdre to prevent her from taking Zach. Together, Mary Alice and Paul buried Dierdre's body beneath their pool.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} FBI {{headquarters}} and types out a resignation letter that he hands into Skinner. Skinner visits his office as Mulder is packing his things, and relates an out-of-body experience {{he had in}} Vietnam. Skinner refuses to accept Mulder's resignation and Mulder realizes {{that he was the}} one who provided him with the Cigarette Smoking Man's location. Heading to the parking garage, Mulder is met by X, telling him that he'll have a chance for revenge that night when men, believing him to have information on Scully, will search his apartment at a specific time. Mulder is <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> his gun at his apartment when Melissa arrives. Although he initially refuses to leave, Melissa is able to convince Mulder to see Scully. While being with Scully, Mulder holds Scully's left hand and talks to her. Returning home to find his apartment trashed, Mulder sits on the floor and cries.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} action, the Swedish fleet {{anchored}} off Trelleborg where King Charles was <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail close-hauled faster {{than the rest of the}} force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.|$|E

The fleet was to refuse combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters.

The reinforcements also brought with them a new commander, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest naval tacticians of his time. Tromp, who also was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch navy, was made Admiral-General of the Danish navy on 8 May 1676. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The rough winds were hard on the Swedish ships. Many lost masts and spars. The Swedes, forming a barely cohesive battle line, tried to sail ahead of Tromp's ships, hoping to get between them and the shore, thus putting themselves on the allied fleet's windward side and gaining the tactical advantage of holding the weather gage. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail closer to the wind and faster {{than the rest of the}} force, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, snatching the weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed on each other, and were soon within firing range.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013, Marks & Spencer {{announced}} that Muslim checkout {{staff in the}} UK could refuse to sell pork products or alcohol to customers at their till. The policy was announced after at least one news outlet reported that customers <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> goods that included pork or alcohol were refused service, and were told by a Muslim checkout worker to wait until another till became available. The policy applied across all 703 UK M stores and prompted a strong backlash by customers.|$|E

25|$|Philip II placed {{great hope}} in the new Grand Armada that was being {{organised}} in Lisbon. There were fifteen galleons from Castile and nine from Portugal, 53 Flemish and German boats which had been impounded, six pinnaces and one caravel, with 10,790 men. From Seville 2,500 troops would depart in 30 flyboats to join the fleet in Lisbon. In the north, at Vigo, a further 41 vessels of various tonnage were <b>waiting,</b> <b>with</b> around 6,000 men. The Adelantado's total force consisted of 11,000 badly furnished and sick infantry and 3,000 cavalry, {{in addition to the}} sailors which numbered 5,500.|$|E
25|$|His {{first win}} was in 1893, in Namur-Dinant-Givet in Belgium. He had sold his first bike {{and bought a}} lighter one — still 16kg but with {{pneumatic}} tyres — for 850 old French francs (approx €3,000 at 2008 values). The race was over 102km. He was leading by Dinant when he punctured. Spotting a soigneur <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> a spare bike for a rival, Garin rested his own {{against the wall of}} a bridge, grabbed the soigneur's spare bike and rode off. At the finish, winning with ten minutes over the field, he gave back the bike and recovered his own the next day where he had left it.|$|E
25|$|Phelps {{threatens to}} kill Ethan, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs {{to the roof}} of the train, where Krieger is <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> a {{helicopter}} and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt resigns. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning.|$|E

25|$|Cox {{enjoyed the}} {{closeness}} of Cynthia Lennon and Pattie Harrison, as they often went on holiday together, shopping, and celebrated Christmas. Starr promised that he would set up a nationwide hairdressing business for his wife, but the idea was later shelved, as she {{had to deal with}} looking after their children and being the wife of a Beatle. This would entail <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> other Beatles' partners, at clubs like the Speakeasy Club, the Ad-Lib, or the Scotch of St James, or staying up all night, waiting for Starr to come home after a recording session, with a cooked meal waiting for him. She was also asked to look after voluminous fan club mail, and would personally answer letters. The Starrs were both interested in various arts, and collaborated on photo montages, paintings and simple sculptures together.|$|E
25|$|Special costume: traditionally, {{the costumes}} of acolytes, footmen, {{ceremonial}} guards, or slaves help {{show off the}} wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom, carried at his coronation by nine lords in <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village, New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.|$|E

After some discussion the doctors decided {{to stop at the}} vicarage of the Rev.Thomas Blackburne, vicar of Eccles, four miles (6.4km) short of Manchester. When told of the decision, Huskisson concurred, saying [...] "Pray do so, I am sure my friend Blackburne will be kind to me", unaware that Blackburne had been invited to the inauguration of the railway and was now <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the passengers at Parkside.|$|E

As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying [...] "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> his microphone for an interview.|$|E

Initially, the album cover was to be shots of the band taken in front of the Fillmore East with their names on the marquee above them, but no one was satisfied with the results. The band's main purpose for the cover was that it be as [...] "meat and potatoes" [...] as the band's ethos and performing, and someone suggested the band make it a photograph of the band in an alley <b>waiting</b> <b>with</b> their gear to go onstage.|$|E
