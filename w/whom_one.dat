5|$|In 1948, Chadwick {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of <b>whom</b> <b>one</b> was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He {{increased the number of}} research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.|$|E

25|$|On {{the level}} of {{developmental}} psychology the Gestaltkreis teachings correspond to Jean Piaget's observances {{on the development of}} the early childhood structures of perception, attitude and thought. In continual assimilation and accommodation processes, the motor cognitive and the emotional development work together and determine each other. The development of the senses, the continually differentiating thought and comportment structures, and the experience of space and time are, for Piaget, the prerequisites for developing the ability to symbolize. Compatible with this are the theories of development in depth psychology, where the main emphasis is on early childhood experience with the people with <b>whom</b> <b>one</b> has relationships and where the condition for a healthy development is a happy relationship with the person to <b>whom</b> <b>one</b> relates most closely (Balint, Mahler, Ericson, Winnicott, Kohut and Kernberg).|$|E
