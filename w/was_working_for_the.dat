They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed {{to the concept of}} violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose.

5|$|Doggett {{served in}} the United States Marine Corps in the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit from 1977-1983. His final rank was Sergeant (E-5). While serving in the military, he became good friends with fellow Marine Knowle Rohrer. From 1982-1983, Doggett {{played a role in}} the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force for Lebanon development. Doggett retired from the U.S. Marine Corps with commendations after being wounded in the line of duty. After gaining a Juris Doctor and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Syracuse University, Doggett went on to work for the New York Police Department from 1987–1995, {{eventually}} becoming a detective in the Fugitive Division's Warrant section. While he <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NYPD, his son, Luke Doggett (played in flashbacks by Jake Fritz), was abducted and murdered.

5|$|In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, George Padmore, who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviet-run Comintern. Over time, {{he became}} Padmore's protégé. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before {{the end of}} the year, the duo {{relocated}} to Moscow, where Kenyatta was instructed in becoming a professional revolutionary at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There, he was among those students who complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. During his time in the Soviet Union, Kenyatta also visited Siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour. The emergence of the Nazi administration in Germany shifted political allegiances in Europe, as the Soviet Union sought to establish formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, thereby reducing its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in Africa. As a result, Comintern disbanded the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, to which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, with the latter returning to London in August 1933.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale {{in the tradition of}} Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E
