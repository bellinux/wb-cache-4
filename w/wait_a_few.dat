5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days {{in the hope that}} the ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|The family {{learns that}} Peter has been {{diagnosed}} with Kidney failure due to the damage done and he {{is in need of}} a transplant. However, since they must <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months before they can get donors, Peter must undergo dialysis at regular intervals. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter gets angry that the dialysis treatments have stolen him from the world. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that one skipping would not hurt him, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his assumptions are false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood.|$|E

25|$|As Menem {{initially}} {{chose to}} deliver the Economy Ministry to senior executives of the firm Bunge y Born, Cavallo had to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more years to put his economic theories into practice. He served as Menem's foreign minister, and {{was instrumental in the}} realignment of Argentina with the Washington Consensus advanced by U.S. President George H.W. Bush. Finally, after several false starts, and two further peaks of hyperinflation, Menem put Cavallo {{at the helm of the}} Argentine Economy Ministry in February, 1991.|$|E
25|$|Police placed Chikatilo under {{surveillance}} on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children, and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, Chikatilo would <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{minutes and then}} seek another conversation partner. On 20 November, after six days of surveillance, Chikatilo left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park, before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting {{to make contact with}} children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, Chikatilo was arrested by four plainclothes police officers.|$|E
25|$|While {{these two}} methodologies did help to {{eliminate}} {{some of the}} possible biases of the original studies, they still operated {{under the assumption that}} there is a causal link between the emotional experience and the development of the process of social sharing. Therefore, a true experimental method was used to study the phenomenon. In these studies, two friends came together to the laboratory, and they were then split up. One of the subjects watched an excerpt of one of three films: either from a documentary about animals (weak emotion), a violent scene between animals (moderate emotion), or a scene depicting humans committing cruel acts towards animals (strong emotion). During this time, the other subject was given a trivial task to complete. Then, the two subjects were reunited and asked to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes for the next part of the experiment. During this time, their conversations were recorded and analyzed for the presence of social sharing. All of these methods produced similar results; social sharing was found to occur for 88–96% of emotional events.|$|E

25|$|When Paget, in 1851, began {{practice}} near Cavendish Square, he {{had still}} to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years more {{for success in}} professional life. The turn of the tide came about 1854 or 1855; and in 1858 he was appointed surgeon extraordinary to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 surgeon in ordinary to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. He had for many years {{the largest and most}} arduous surgical practice in London. His day's work was seldom less than 16 or 17 hours. Cases sent to him for final judgment, with especial frequency, were those of tumours, and of all kinds of disease of the bones and joints, and all neurotic cases having symptoms of surgical disease. His supremacy lay rather in the science than in the art of surgery, but his name is also associated with certain great practical advances. He discovered the Paget's disease of the breast and the Paget's disease of the bones (osteitis deformans), which are named after him; {{he was the first to}} urge removal of the tumour, instead of amputation of the limb, in cases of myeloid sarcoma. In 1869 he was elected President of the Clinical Society of London.|$|E
500|$|George {{decides to}} call Carol, but gets her {{answering}} machine. He leaves her an extremely long, obnoxious message, and {{is concerned that}} she will think he is an idiot. Jerry's friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) tells George how something similar happened to her brother-in-law, {{who took care of}} the problem by secretly switching the tape. Jerry advises George to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry — and eventually almost hostile — messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use an answering machine, George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and George will distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had already heard the messages and found them funny, adding that she [...] "loves jokes like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E

500|$|According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee {{public defender}} {{and member of}} the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was {{negotiated}} in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because [...] "prospects of losing at trial were very good." [...] Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a [...] "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal. At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. [...] "It made him realize {{he was going to have}} to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. [...] "He just couldn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the actor}} turned 18, his sexualized image was often critiqued, {{and subject to}} controversy. In December 2009, Lautner {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone in a wet T-shirt. Jennifer Cady of E! Online said to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months when Lautner would [...] "be of age, which will make this whole operation you got going on completely legal." [...] In his interview with the magazine, after declining to talk about whether he was dating Taylor Swift, the magazine pressed Lautner on rumors of him being homosexual, which he brushed off. Brent Hartinger, a columnist for AfterElton, blasted the magazine, calling the questioning [...] "unimaginably irresponsible," [...] commenting that Lautner was just [...] "a 17-year old kid" [...] and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans, it was disappointing that a [...] "legitimate media outlet" [...] would print gossip. Hartinger said the magazine reached a [...] "new low" [...] and did not have common decency, noting that the line between child and adult [...] "is there for a good reason".|$|E
500|$|Following the Rose Bowl, Michigan {{needed to}} <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{days for the}} final polls. On January 4, it was {{revealed}} that Nebraska had overtaken Michigan by four points and two first place votes in the coaches poll to earn a split in the major national polls. [...] Nebraska had beaten Tennessee 42–17 and totaled 534 yards of total offense, including 409 rushing yards and an Orange Bowl record-setting 206 rushing yards by Ahman Green. Michigan held on to a 51.5–18.5 final first place vote lead in the AP Poll, but had a 32–30 deficit in the coaches poll. [...] Since the 1968 permanent creation of the final post bowl game AP poll, no winning No. 1 team had lost its lead following a bowl game, but the 1990 Colorado Buffaloes football team had lost the coaches poll to Georgia Tech following a 10–9 1991 Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame. [...] In addition to bowl game victory margins, Tom Osborne's retirement and the Big Ten's cumulative 2–5 bowl game record were considered factors leading to the split polls. [...] Michigan was named as the national champion by the following polls: Associated Press, Football News, Football Writers Association of America, National Championship Foundation, National Football Foundation, and Sporting News.|$|E

In the Women's Quadrangular Series in India in 2006, Colvin took three wickets for 47 against New Zealand, and then 3 for 50 in the 3rd–4th playoff to secure the England team 3rd place.|$|E
2500|$|Women should <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{years after}} they first have {{intercourse}} before they start screening, {{and should not be}} screened before age 21. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women). [...] Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that people with uteruses age 30–65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, and that they do get Pap tests at three-year intervals.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July Wolfe {{was at the}} Pointe-Lévy camp to reconnoiter {{the north}} shore west of Quebec. He moved further west the next day, {{near the mouth of}} the Chaudière River, to study the {{opposite}} shore between Sillery and Cap Rouge. Wolfe wrote to Monckton with orders for a plan of attack involving a landing near the village of Saint-Michel, something he had already considered in June. However, at 13:00, Wolfe countermanded his orders to Monckton, ordering him instead to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days and remain ready to act quickly, because of some [...] "particular circumstances". It is possible that the circumstance he alluded to was a French counteroffensive in which a newly built battery at Samos (near Sillery) damaged the Squirrel.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|E
2500|$|Under Israeli control, {{members of}} all {{religions}} are largely granted {{access to their}} holy sites. The major exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from accessing holy sites due to their inadmissibility to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from visiting the Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where {{they are allowed to}} walk on the Mount in small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid Jews from trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about possible attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious fire broke in the mosque in 1969 (started by Denis Michael Rohan, an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out following the opening of an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel on the instructions of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior Prime Minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace (stating [...] "it has waited for over 1000 years, it could <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more").|$|E
2500|$|While the game's primary {{gameplay}} modes {{were easily}} developed {{to account for}} unique abilities of all characters, the developers also had thought about a Capture the Flag mode for several years, recognizing that most team-based first-person shooters included some type of variant on this mode. The largest issue that this mode faced was the speed or warping abilities {{of some of the}} characters, like Tracer, which could pick up the flag and warp back to their base, leaving the other team unable to stop them. Thus they would either find matches reduced to players selecting the speediest characters, or having to put so many restrictions in place that the result game no longer felt like Overwatch. Over several iterations, they devised a scheme that they put to public testing in January 2017 through the [...] "Capture the Rooster" [...] special event to celebrate the Chinese New Year; here, to prevent speedy characters from running immediately after collecting the flag, they must <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds before they can run or use their special powers, leaving them vulnerable for that period. Initially having no plans to retain the Capture the Flag mode after the event, Blizzard announced that they will keep the event as a custom game mode with additional options.|$|E
