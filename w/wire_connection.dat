2500|$|Each {{thyristor}} valve will typically contain tens or {{hundreds of}} thyristor levels, each operating at a different (high) potential with respect to earth. [...] The command information {{to turn on the}} thyristors therefore cannot simply be sent using a <b>wire</b> <b>connection</b> – it needs to be isolated. [...] The isolation method can be magnetic (using pulse transformers) but is usually optical. [...] Two optical methods are used: [...] indirect and direct optical triggering. [...] In the indirect optical triggering method, the low-voltage control electronics sends light pulses along optical fibres to the high-side control electronics, which derives its power from the voltage across each thyristor. [...] The alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses with most of the high-side electronics, instead using light pulses from the control electronics to switch light-triggered thyristors (LTTs), although a small monitoring electronics unit may still be required for protection of the valve.|$|E
2500|$|Most home hi-fi {{loudspeakers}} use two wiring {{points to}} connect {{to the source of}} the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or receiver). To accept the <b>wire</b> <b>connection,</b> the loudspeaker enclosure may have binding posts, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −; [...] speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be [...] "out of phase" [...] or more properly [...] "out of polarity". Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.|$|E

50|$|A {{multiplying}} DAC used as {{a digital}} potentiometer can eliminate most of these limitations. Typically a signal span of +15V to -15V is possible, with 16 bit control, i.e. 65535 discrete set points, and drift and non-linearity are negligible.

50|$|The Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedo, a.k.a. ASTOR, was a submarine-launched wire-guided nuclear torpedo {{designed}} by the United States Navy for use against high-speed, deep-diving, enemy submarines. The 19 in-diameter torpedo was fitted with a W34 nuclear warhead. The need to maintain direct control over the warhead meant that a <b>wire</b> <b>connection</b> had to be maintained between the torpedo and submarine until detonation. Wire guidance systems were piggybacked onto this cable, and the torpedo had no homing capability. The design was completed in 1960, and 600 torpedoes were built between 1963 and 1976, when ASTOR {{was replaced by the}} Mark 48 torpedo.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{wireless}} networks, {{setting up}} a computer network in a business, home or school often required running many cables through walls and ceilings in order to deliver network access {{to all of the}} network-enabled devices in the building.
