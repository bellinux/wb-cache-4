40|$|The {{demand for}} an {{alternative}} and a high potency sweetener to substitute sugar increases year in year out, more so as {{a high percentage of}} the world population becomes increasingly diabetic. The alternative natural sweetener at hand has been Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, a plant species, native to Paraguay {{and a member of the}} family compositae. Stevia is usually propagated by stem cuttings due to low percentage (10 %) seed germination, thus limiting large scales cultivation. To cultivate this crop en mass therefore, there is need to evolve efficient <b>rooting</b> techniques. Influences <b>of</b> irradiation from light, and hormones on rooting have been reported. The rooting efficacy in stem cuttings of this crop under varying light wavelengths, dark and hormone factors was investigated. Evaluated parameters include- (i) day <b>of</b> <b>root</b> emergent, (ii) percentage <b>of</b> <b>rooted</b> cuttings, (iii) average number, (iv) length and (v) <b>width,</b> <b>of</b> <b>roots.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> variance at p<. 05 revealed that the number, length and <b>width,</b> <b>of</b> <b>roots</b> differed significantly in each case at p< 0. 000.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} a study of {{invariant}} sets that have “geometric” rotation numbers, which we call rotational sets, for the angle-tripling map σ 3 :T→T, and more generally, the angle-d-tupling map σd:T→T for d⩾ 2.

In contrast to σ 2, the proliferation of rotational sets with the same rotation number for σd, d> 2, is elucidated by the existence of canonical operations allowing one to reduce σd to σd− 1 and construct σd+ 1 from σd by, respectively, removing or inserting “wraps” of the covering map that, respectively, destroy or create/enlarge <b>root</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R

Both epithelized and subepithelial connective tissue grafts offer predictable {{solutions for the}} treatment of gingival recession. The case report involved a 30 -year-old man with gingival recession of 8 mm on 41 (Miller′s class II recession). Before surgery, full mouth scaling and polishing were performed. Recession height, width, probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the attached gingiva (WAG) were measured at the baseline, two months postoperatively, and six months postoperatively.

This regime is analogous to the conjectured 'hard but detectable' regime for community detection in sparse graphs.

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} observation that in some subjects w ith early-onset periodontitis there is a peculiar tapering slenderness <b>of</b> <b>root</b> form. This study compares the degree of taper <b>of</b> the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> maxillary second premolars, and <b>of</b> the distal <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> mandibular first molars of patients with early-onset periodontitis experimental subjects), with that <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> control subjects. It seeks {{to determine whether the}} degree of taper is ascribable to a particular part of the root; whether differences if any are related to gender or to race; and whether the molars or the premolars would be better diagnostic aids to, and predictors of disease. Periapical radiographs of tw enty teeth of each type were selected for the experimental am control groups. Accurate large scale tracings <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> outlines were made from radiographs. Using the mesiodistal <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roots</b> at the cemento-enamel junction {{in the case of the}} premolars, and at the root bifurcation in the case <b>of</b> the distal <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> the molars as baseline measurements, the degrees of taper <b>of</b> the <b>roots</b> were determined. Statistical comparison of the degrees <b>of</b> taper <b>of</b> <b>roots</b> from experimental subjects with those <b>of</b> the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> control subjects iv showed strong evidence of a sharper degree of taper in the former; this was more pronounced for the premolars than for the molars. The degree of taper was more marked in the apical half <b>of</b> the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> experimental molars; but in experimental premolars the increased taper was evident throughout the entire length <b>of</b> the <b>root.</b> In the case of the experimental molar roots, there is a relationship between race and the degree of taper: this highlights the desirability of future studies examining the <b>root</b> forms <b>of</b> racially segregated groups. There is no relationship between gender and the tapering of the experimental molar roots. For premolars the increased taper of experimental teeth is related neither to race nor to gender. Prediction and diagnosis of disease is more reliable with premolars than with molars, because the latter taper more sharply only along a portion <b>of</b> their <b>roots.</b> In an affected individual, the maxillary second premolar appears to be a reliable predictor and an indicator of early-onset periodontitis. The distal <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the mandibular first molar likewise is a predictor and an indicator of early-onset periodontitis; but as its degree of taper is less pronounced and occurs only in the apical half <b>of</b> the <b>root,</b> its reliability in these roles may be diminished...|$|R
40|$|The radial growth <b>of</b> <b>roots</b> largely affects and reorganizes the porous or crack {{networks}} of soils and substrates. We studied {{the consequences of}} a radial steric constriction on the root growth and the feedback force developed by the root on the solid phase. We developed an original method of photoelasticity to measure in situ root forces. By changing the gap width (0. 5 to 2. 3 mm) between two photoelastic disks we applied variable radial constrictions to root growth and simultaneously measured the corresponding radial forces. Changes in morphology and forces <b>of</b> primary <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> chick pea (Cicer arietinum L.) seedlings were recorded by time-lapse imaging every 24 min up to 5 days. The probability <b>of</b> <b>root</b> entering the <b>gap</b> depended on the gap size but was also affected by circumnutation. Compared to non-constrained root controls, no significant morphological change (elongation, diameter) was measured outside the gap zone. Inside the gap zone, outer cortex cells were compressed, the central cylinder was unaffected. Radial forces were increasing with time but no force levelling was observed even after 5 days. Radial constrictions applied to roots did not significantly reduce their growth. The radial force was related to the root strain in the gap...|$|R

40|$|One hundred human lower second molars, 51 {{from the}} left side and 49 from the right side, {{extracted}} due to their poor clinical and radiographic conditions were utilized in this study. Using a Contracer apparatus, the profiles of the buccal and lingual <b>root</b> surfaces <b>of</b> these teeth were traced on a millimeter-scaled paper. The profiles were registered from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), millimeter by millimeter, up to the entrance of the furcation. The width, length and depth <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk groove, as well as the length <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk, were studied. After statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) it was possible to conclude that: a) the mean <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk groove on the buccal surface was 3. 6 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 3 mm; b) the mean depth <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk groove on the buccal surface was 0. 88 mm and, on the lingual surface, 0. 77 mm; c) the mean length <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk groove on the buccal surface was 2. 93 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 61 mm. The mean length <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk on the buccal surface was 3. 09 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 91 mm (p < 0. 025). There was a coincidence between the length <b>of</b> the <b>root</b> trunk and that of its groove in 90. 2 % of the buccal surfaces of the samples {{from the left}} side, and in 77. 5 % of the samples from the right side; on the lingual surface, the coincidence occurred in 77. 5 % of the teeth {{from the left side}}, and on 88. 3 % of the teeth from the right side. This work revealed that there is a concavity on the <b>root</b> trunk region <b>of</b> the lower second molar, whose depth and width were greater on the buccal surface and whose length was greater on the lingual surface.

40|$|Estudos investigativos sobre a influência da hereditariedade nas fissuras orofaciais têm sugerido que indivíduos não-afetados com filhos portadores de fissura labiopalatina apresentam morfologia craniofacial distinta da população geral. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi, por meio de antropometria direta da face, estudar as dimensões faciais dos pais de fissurados em relação a indivíduos sem histórico {{familiar}} de fissura, com a finalidade de determinar características faciais que possam inferir uma predisposição à fissura. A amostra foi constituída por 244 indivíduos leucodermas, com média de idade de 34, 1 anos, sendo 50 pais e 94 mães de crianças com fissura de lábio com ou sem envolvimento do palato, registrados na Faculdade de Odontologia da Universidade de São Paulo, formando o grupo de estudo, que foi subdividido em grupo pais, grupo mães e grupo casal; e 50 homens e 50 mulheres com ausência de história familiar de anomalias craniofaciais, compondo o grupo controle. Após a marcação de pontos antropométricos na face, foram realizadas 38 medidas antropométricas, correspondendo às dimensões faciais de altura, largura e profundidade, com auxílio de paquímetro digital e compasso facial. Para a análise estatística foi utilizado o teste t de Student com correção de Levene para igualdade de variâncias. Os resultados estatisticamente significantes, para o grupo pais, foram: largura da testa; largura da face e distâncias inter-orbital interna e externa menores, enquanto que a largura da base do nariz, a altura do perfil inferior e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo foram maiores. No grupo mães, a distância pupila-linha média lado direito, a largura da base do nariz, a largura do nariz, a largura anatômica do nariz, a largura da columela, a altura do terço superior da face e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo apresentaram-se maiores. Os resultados do grupo casal foram pouco consistentes porque reproduziram os registrados nos subgrupos individuais. Embora diversas medidas tenham mostrado diferenças entre o grupo de estudo e o controle, apenas a largura da base do nariz e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo se apresentam com as dimensões aumentadas nas respectivas subdivisões: pais, mães e casal. Concluiu-se que, pais e mães de crianças portadoras de fissuras labiopalatinas apresentam morfologia craniofacial distinta em relação à população geral; entretanto, não foi possível definir um padrão facial característico. Recent studies {{concerning the}} influence of inheritance in orofacial clefts suggest that non-affected parents of children that present cleft lip and palate show distinctive craniofacial morphology compared to the overall population. The main objective {{of this research was}} to analyze and compare the facial dimensions of non-affected parents of affected children and individuals with no history of clefting in the family. The method used was the direct facial anthropometry, since it can determine facial characteristics that may be related to predisposition to cleft. The sample used comprised 244 leukoderms, averaging 34, 1 years old, registered at the Dentistry School of the University of São Paulo. The sample was divided in study group and control group. The study group was composed of 50 fathers and 94 mothers of children affected by cleft lip and/or palate and was sub-divided in three sub-groups: fathers, mothers and couples. The control group was composed of 50 man and 50 women with no history of craniofacial anomalies. To evaluate the distinctive facial dimensions, a set of 38 anthropometric measurements were made using a sliding caliper and a spreading caliper to determine the length, width and depth. For statistical analysis the Student t test was used with Leveneś correction for equal variances. The statistically significant results were: - Fathers group: smaller <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the forehead; smaller <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the face; smaller intercanthal width and biocular width as well as larger <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the nasal <b>root,</b> larger height <b>of</b> the lower profile and larger depth of the left lower jaw. - Mothers group: larger pupil-facial midline right distance, larger <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the nasal <b>root,</b> larger <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the nose, larger width between the facial insertion points of the alar base, larger <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the columella, larger height of the upper profile and larger depth of the left lower jaw. For the parents group, no statistical differences were identified, with results similar to the other two study groups. Although several measurements showed differences from the study group to the control group only <b>width</b> <b>of</b> nasal <b>root</b> and depth <b>of</b> the left lower jaw showed bigger dimensions in the three subgroups, fathers, mothers and couples. In conclusion, this study showed that fathers and mothers of children with cleft lip and palate show different craniofacial morphology compared to the overall population, but it was impossible to delineate a pattern...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} thermopower of a {{three-terminal}} setup {{composed of a}} quantum dot attached to three electrodes, {{one of which is}} a topological superconductor. In the model, superconductivity is explicitly taken into account. We compare the results for s-wave (trivial) and p-wave (topological) superconductors and observe that for small temperatures the thermopower has different sign in the two cases. This behavior is strongly dependent on temperature and we estimate an energy scale that controls the sign in the p-wave case, which results proportional to the square <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gap</b> and the coupling to superconductor. The analytical results obtained with a simple 1 D model are confirmed by a more realistic tight-binding model. Comment: 10 pages, 15 figures, published versio...|$|R
