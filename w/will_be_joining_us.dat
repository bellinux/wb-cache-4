On her casting, Jackson said, [...] "Cate {{is one of my favorite}} actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films." [...] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a [...] "wizard" [...] in October 2010, leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown.

Nick Jordan will put a few noses out of joint, most notably Adam's. Adam knows Nick Jordan's reputation of old, and finds {{it hard to believe that}} Nick is a good guy. Nick Jordan causes ripples wherever he goes, and it's great that he'll be causing ripples in Holby City's Emergency Department. The ED gang are astonished he is joining them, they certainly didn't see it coming. Some of them know him of old, whereas some of the others have just heard of his reputation - either way, his arrival certainly puts the cat among the pigeons." [...] Michael French has stated of the transfer: [...] "The BBC came up with the idea of Nick Jordan coming back to head up Casualty.

A spokesperson said: [...] "I can confirm that Andrew Sachs has taken us up on the offer. He <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> later this year." [...] Sachs said that he had already had an idea about playing Ramsay five years before: [...] "Myself and my wife had dreamt up a storyline where I played Norris's brother. We thought it would be great fun if a brother every bit as annoying as Norris turned up and the pair of them wound everyone up." [...] Sachs also revealed that he was scared about being on the soap: [...] "I nearly turned them down because I was too scared. I said to my wife that I didn't think I could do it. Apparently there is very little rehearsal time and I said I wasn't sure I liked the part anyway." [...] Asked by Digital Spy [...] "What's it been like working with Andrew Sachs for the past few months?", Malcolm Hebden replied: [...] ""It was suggested {{two or three years ago}} that Andrew Sachs wanted to be my brother and because we had a change of perhaps two producers in that time, it just got lost in the hundreds of storylines we have. I was talking to our new producer Kim Crowther and said I thought it was a great shame we'd never picked up the Andrew Sachs stuff and she knew nothing of it. She thought it was a great idea and she made it happen. Andrew was very happy to do it." [...] He also went on to say: [...] "I had met Andrew once before and he expressed how keen he was to do it. We got on terribly well. I think it took him a little while to get used to my sense of humour but he did by the time he left! For me, the storyline kicks in once he's dead - that sounds awful - but I was just being dismissive and blocking Ramsay for the first part of the story. I just didn't want anything to do with him. Then Ramsay goes back to Australia and dies on the aeroplane but the fallout is enormous - not just for Norris, but particularly for Emily. She'd become quite fond of Ramsay. He's a civilised man and quite a charming character, whereas Norris isn't. Therefore, I'm going to be terribly unpopular for a little while until Norris realises that he was wrong." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present Clara, a novel static-analysis {{framework}} {{for the implementation of}} hybrid static/dynamic typestate analyses. Clara uses static typestate analyses to automatically convert any AspectJ monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor that only monitors events triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe. If the static analysis succeeds on all locations, this gives strong static guarantees. If not, the efficient residual runtime monitor is guaranteed to capture property violations at runtime. Researchers can easily integrate their own static typestate analyses into Clara. We instantiated Clara with three static typestate analyses and applied these analyses to monitoring aspects generated from tracematches and by the JavaMOP runtime-monitoring tool. Clara is available as open source. We hope that other researchers <b>will</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> in using Clara, and that this will foster progress in the field of typestate analysis. ...|$|R

Olivera’s passion for the rule of law, human rights and social justice informs her work, which has been published in English, Spanish and German. At Osgoode, she will be working on a project that will explore the boundaries of the law concerning child abuse and exploitation and the proliferation of offending material online in the digital age. “This appointment is for me a great opportunity to work alongside internationally renowned scholars on a project that aims to stir debate about change in national and global legislation regarding online child exploitation and how to better support and protect survivors,” Olivera said. Olivera’s reporting has appeared in digital, broadcast and print media.

40|$|Conclusion] In conclusion, {{it must be}} {{acknowledged}} that the phenomenon of China in the global arena is quite significant. It presents opportunities and challenges which African policy makers and thinkers must take very seriously and respond to it very intensively. This is particularly so as {{other regions of the}} world, not the least the OECD countries, Asian and Latin American countries are already responding to this phenomenon. In this regard, the African Economic Research Consortium is embarking on an in-depth research on Impact of China and India on Africa. Already, a planning meeting has been held in Nairobi on July 6, 2006. An outcome of the meeting was the identification of the key issues and sectors of concern. The research team will focus on detailed analysis of the likely direct and indirect impact of China and India on Africa in the short, medium and long terms under alternative but plausible scenarios. Background papers in the areas of petroleum, other solid minerals, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and governance are being finalized. These papers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> deliberated upon in Addis Ababa on October 9 - 10. Thereafter, senior African scholars will prepare a synthesis paper which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> presented at a global meeting of researchers and policy makers to be held later in the year. Policy makers and other stakeholders <b>will</b> <b>be</b> invited of <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in setting the research agenda and continue to participate in the research review meetings that <b>will</b> follow. It <b>is</b> our hope that this effort will provide useful input into the activities of this important and timely Task Force...|$|R
40|$|With the {{upcoming}} November convention, I {{would like to}} take this opportunity to thank the many volunteers who gave their time in reviewing proposals, those who will serve as a session chair or discussant, {{as well as those who}} have planned some of {{the upcoming}} Division events. The Division is only as strong as its volunteer base and because of the Division’s support base it remains one of NAGC’s strongest. Your contributions lead to a successful convention with sessions ranging across a variety of topics and appealing to a wider NAGC audience. THANK YOU!! Over the course of the next several months, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> working with others in trying to position the Division to make a stronger connection to the larger organization’s membership as well as to other Divisions. My goal as Chair is to position the Division to work collaboratively with other Divisions in holding pre-convention Institutes, to offer more convention sessions focused on research to practice topics, and to take a lead in disseminating information to the field at large on ratcheting up research designs to begin to build a stronger empirical evidence base for the field. Stay tuned for the ways that you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> invited to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> as we move the Division forward. Finally, I want to encourage you to read the items in this newsletter. We have spotlighted last year’s Research Gala winner—Patti Wood from the University of Alabama. Patti took the honor of winning the Doctoral Gold Award as well as the Overall Most Outstanding Paper Award. Congratulations to Patti and the other Gala winners. I look forward to seeing you at the Convention...|$|R
