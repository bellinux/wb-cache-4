5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|He <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> {{day after}} federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc rehearing {{by the entire}} court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} any way.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1894, a {{committee}} {{was established to}} plan a branch from the Jæren Line to Ålgård. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from Orstad in Klepp, which would cost 348,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK60,000 of the capital, {{on the condition that}} NSB would build and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to be private. Private railways were often largely or entirely owned by municipalities, counties and the state, but would operate independent of NSB and the municipalities <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> risk for operating deficits.|$|E

5|$|By 1857 a {{blast furnace}} had opened {{close to the}} Durham {{coalfield}} {{on the north side}} of the Tees. Backed by the rival West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway, the Durham & Cleveland Union Railway proposed a line from the mines in Skinningrove and Staithes, via Guisborough and a bridge over the Middlesbrough & Redcar Railway to a jetty at Cargo Fleet, from where a ferry <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> ore across the Tees to the blast furnaces. When the proposal was before Parliament the S suggested that their Middlesbrough & Redcar could be extended to Saltburn, and the Tees crossed by a swing bridge. The Cleveland Railway received permission for a line from Skinningrove as far as Guisborough, and the S permission for an extension to Saltburn and a branch to a mine at Skelton. This 1858 S Act also authorised the merger of the S with the railways it held on lease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, {{planning}} began for a bypass around the downtown {{portion of the}} city of Brawley. An expressway <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> routing of SR78 north and east of the city, with an interchange at SR111, before intersecting with the current alignment of SR78. A Swedish company began construction on this bypass in April 2008; the first phase consisted of the portion of the bypass that is solely SR111. The second phase of the bypass, from the western junction with SR111 to the eastern junction with SR78, lasted from February 2008 to June 2011. On the third phase of the project, from the junction with SR86 west of Brawley to the western end of the completed bypass, construction began in late 2010. This project was identified in August 2010 as a project that could be affected by California state budget cuts. The Brawley Bypass, as it was known, opened on October 30, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E

25|$|Outram also {{proposed}} {{to save some}} £4000 by dispensing with the aqueduct and, instead, building a weir to raise the river level to form a basin adjacent to the Morledge, with locks connecting it to each branch of the canal.

25|$|It {{is clear}} that a {{grateful}} nation, recognizing the tremendous contributions of the key military and naval leaders in World War II, created these supreme grades {{as an attempt to}} accord to these leaders the prestige, the clear-cut leadership, and the emolument of office befitting their service to their country in war. It is the conviction of the Department of the Air Force that this recognition was and is appropriate. Moreover, appointments to this grade during periods other than war <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> unavoidable connotation of downgrading of those officers so honored in World War II.|$|E

25|$|The next day, 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne {{would play}} a {{critical}} role in the final stroke against Robespierre and his allies. As Saint-Just delivered his speech, he was interrupted near the beginning by another conspirator, Jean-Lambert Tallien. Billaud-Varenne was next to speak, with Collot d'Herbois controlling the debates from the President's Chair, and in an eloquent planned denunciation directly accused Robespierre of a conspiracy against the Republic. This speech and others were warmly received, and after continued debate arrest warrants were issued for Robespierre, Saint-Just, and their allies. After a brief armed standoff, the conspirators <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> day, and Robespierre and his allies would be executed the next day.|$|E
25|$|Ohio State {{appeared}} {{to take control}} of the game right from the opening kickoff, when Rex Kern kept the ball and ran for 25 yards on the first play from scrimmage. Jim Otis <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> next three plays for another first down. The Buckeyes got the ball to the Michigan 11, when the Wolverine defense ended the drive on a fourth down-and-two to take over. Michigan failed to get a first down, and the Buckeyes would get the ball back and get on the scoreboard first, on a 1-yard touchdown run by Otis. A missed extra-point left the score 6–0 in favor of the scarlet-and-gray.|$|E
25|$|The {{access to}} Swansea {{was of course}} {{important}} both to the railway and to the dock complex there, and in 1883 a further Bill was promoted, to reach Swansea by tunnelling under the River Neath. Against technical opposition, this was passed. The tunnel would have cost £72,000 and in fact an agreement was reached with the Great Western Railway by which the GWR <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> R traffic between Port Talbot and the R lines at Swansea. (The existing GWR main line largely paralleled the proposed R line.) This enabled the abandonment of the plans to reach Briton Ferry {{and to make the}} tunnel, and the Company's capital was reduced accordingly, by Act of 1886.|$|E
