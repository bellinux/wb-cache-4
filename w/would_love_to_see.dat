25|$|In a 2006 interview, Ristar {{designer}} Akira Nishino said:Will Ristar come back? Probably not. Of course, {{as a game}} developer, I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it happen. At {{the time}} of the original, I was thinking of a sequel. It got as far as a character design for that sequel, but it didn't happen for various reasons. But since fans have a say in such matters, your input is greatly appreciated.|$|E
25|$|Goichi Suda {{stated that}} he would not mind seeing Travis appear in the Super Smash Bros. series. Joystiq editor Randy Nelson agreed, stating that he <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Travis with his beam katana in the next title. Destructoid editor Jim Sterling {{stated that he}} <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Travis {{included}} just by the virtue that it is a creation of Suda's, who he is a fan of. He commented that the close relationship between Suda and Hideo Kojima, whose character Solid Snake is already in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, makes it possible that he could appear. Inc Gamers editor Tim McDonald described Travis as a good fit for the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Kombo editor David Oxford stated that while {{he did not want to}} see the cast of the Super Smash Bros. series diluted by third party characters, he could easily see Travis not only fitting into the series, but being fun to play with. Escapist Magazine editor Keane Ng expressed the opinion that while the two third party characters included in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, were highly popular characters, Travis is an unlikely character due to being far less recognizable. He added that while Snake was from a Mature-rated video game, he fit in well; Travis' personality would make him too difficult to include, despite his fighting style being similar to other Smash Bros. characters. As such Travis Touchdown was not added to the final cut of the game.|$|E

Sat Bains went a step further and said [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Claude Bosi regain his second star at Hibiscus and win his third in time. He's probably the best chef I know." [...] The restaurant closed permanently in 2016, two days prior to the announcement of the 2017 Michelin Guide for UK and Ireland.|$|E

500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced.

Pahang FC were equally pleased with his contribution. Club CEO and Vice President Datuk Akbar V V Abu was quoted as saying:"Zesh served as an excellent player for Pahang for 3 years in a successful trophy winning team.

500|$|The {{castle and}} chapel have been Grade I listed {{buildings}} since 1949 {{and form a}} Scheduled Ancient Monument {{under the care of}} English Heritage, who took over the site in 1984, although Sunderland City Council own the land. In 1999, the Friends of Hylton Dene group was formed by residents of the estates around North Hylton [...] "with the aim of co-operating with Sunderland City Council, Durham Wildlife Trust and other agencies to actively involve the local community in the development and upkeep of Hylton Dene and Castle". In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened. The chairman of the Castle in the Community John Coulthard described the castle, Sunderland's second oldest building, as [...] "an asset in the city– it is a lovely setting and we <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it bring in some income".|$|E

I <b>would</b> just <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. I {{suppose it is}} because she is sitting on those eggs that I haven't seen Mrs. Redwing.

500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.'

500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E
