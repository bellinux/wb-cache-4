5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E

5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food to those who <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of}} the 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|Now a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was {{controlled}} {{by a series of}} keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles. This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 19July 1941, Stojanović and Bašić arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, {{situated}} at Rajlića Kosa above the village of Malo Palančište. The news of Stojanović's escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their credibility and esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp. People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanović and his young comrades. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers, telling them {{to be prepared for}} an impending uprising and urging them to bring him rifles they <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> in their homes. The camp at Rajlića Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.|$|E

50|$|In {{the weeks}} before his arrest, Hadžić {{disappeared}} {{from his home in}} Novi Sad, Serbia. In 2005, Serbian media reported he might <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in a Serbian Orthodox monastery in Irig or in Bijela, Montenegro. Nenad Čanak, the leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, claimed in 2006 that Hadžić <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in a monastery somewhere on Fruška mountain. At one point he was also rumoured to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in Belarus.|$|R
5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> in his cornfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{posters of}} Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day {{a member of}} the public came forward to provide {{information}} about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.|$|E
5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the unguarded bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did not destroy the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and other vehicles could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped choke point created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> behind a clump of trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E

50|$|During World War II many {{families}} in the village hid their Jewish neighbours to help them survive the Holocaust. It is now estimated that at least 17 Jews survived the war in Markowa. Seven members of the Weltz family <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in the barn of Dorota and Antoni Szylar. Jakub Einhorn's family <b>was</b> <b>hidden</b> by Jan and Weronika Przybylak and Jakub Lorbenfeld and his family <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> by Michal Bar.

5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that remains is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E
5|$|In 1071 William {{defeated}} the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed {{by his own}} men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar <b>were</b> <b>hiding.</b> Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the Treaty of Abernethy, and Malcolm probably gave up his son Duncan as a hostage for the peace. Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm's court. William then {{turned his attention to}} the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by Fulk le Rechin, the Count of Anjou. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister Bertha to the king of France, Philip I, who was opposed to Norman power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 had begun when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in the eastern Mediterranean and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E
5|$|The {{band was}} {{travelling}} home to Dublin {{late at night}} after a performance in Banbridge. Halfway to Newry, their minibus was stopped at {{what appeared to be}} a military checkpoint, where gunmen in British Army uniforms ordered them to line up by the roadside. At least four of the gunmen were serving soldiers from the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) but, unbeknownst to the band, all were members of the UVF. While two of the gunmen (both soldiers) <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> a time bomb on the minibus, it exploded prematurely and killed them. The other gunmen then opened fire on the dazed band members, killing three and wounding two. It is believed the bomb was meant to explode en route, killing the band and framing them as IRA bomb-smugglers, and possibly leading to stricter security measures at the border.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E
25|$|The French {{privateer}} {{forced the}} frigate {{to return to}} the harbor, because he suspected that among its crew <b>were</b> <b>hiding</b> some of the mutineers.
