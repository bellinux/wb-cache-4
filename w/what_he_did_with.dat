5|$|Alison Hendrix {{returns home}} from rehab {{to find her}} husband Donnie drunk and chastises him. When she catches him trying {{to leave the house}} {{in the middle of the}} night, she persuades him not to give up on their marriage. In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their {{neighbour}} Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night before. When Alison asks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse is wrapped in the trunk of their car.|$|E
5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> his non-playing time.|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{a lifelong}} {{cigarette}} smoker. During a television interview, Miller {{explained that he}} composed his songs from [...] "bits and pieces" [...] of ideas he wrote on scraps of paper. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the unused bits and pieces, he half-joked, [...] "I smoke 'em!" [...] He also wrote a song about his habit, titled [...] "Dad Blame Anything A Man Can't Quit". Miller died of lung and throat cancer in 1992, at age 56, shortly after {{the discovery of a}} malignant tumor under his vocal cords. His remains were cremated.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Then {{you agree}} that Mr. Hornblower at least should be told. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the {{knowledge}} is not our affair.|$|R
60|$|I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, {{as well as}} her heart. I shudder {{to think}} <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> them, by this time.|$|R

500|$|Several of Rivera's colleagues credit {{him with}} popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted the pitch {{later in his}} career, said, [...] "I think he's been an {{influence}} on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [...] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, {{you talk about the}} evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." [...] Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: [...] "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> one pitch." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2015 USA Today {{article about}} how the actors of The Cosby Show responded to the allegations, Keshia Knight Pulliam of the cast stated [...] "All I can speak to is the man I know and I {{love the fact that}} he has been such an example [...] you can't take away from the great that he has done, the {{millions}} and millions of dollars he has given back to colleges and education, and just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Cosby Show and how groundbreaking that was. The Cosbys, we were the first family that no matter what race, religion, you saw yourself in", further addressing the charges against Cosby. [...] "At the end of the day they are allegations ... I don't have that story to tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E

6000|$|Of a truth, if {{man were}} not a poor hungry dastard, and even much of a {{blockhead}} withal, he would cease criticising his victuals to such extent; and criticise himself rather, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> his victuals! ...|$|R
50|$|Lord Lloyd {{said that}} though courts {{do not care}} what damages will be used for, the {{intention}} of the innocent party for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> them may be relevant to the issue of reasonableness in awarding damages.|$|R
60|$|He began {{all right}} and then {{something}} seemed to happen, {{and then he was}} finishing it. I cannot make out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the middle of the story.|$|E
60|$|He {{particularly}} {{loved the}} evangelists, following {{the footsteps of}} Jesus Christ, dwelling upon his words, repeating {{over and over again}} the stories of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>with</b> all the fond veneration of an old and favored servant.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> {{the father}} of quarrymen was not known, whether he talked him over, or bought him off--Margaret hoped the former; Dr. May feared the latter; the results were certain; Mr. Nicolson had agreed that the land should be given up.|$|E
60|$|The {{witnesses}} who came next {{did their best}} to press the charge against the prisoner home to him. Having the arsenic in his possession, <b>what</b> had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it? The evidence led the jury to infer <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it's all right. Gran'dad is slick. They'll hev to get {{up early}} in the mornin' to beat him at his own game. But I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the {{counterfeit}} money, or the real money he trades it for." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bless me, Martin {{thought to}} himself, <b>he</b> doesn't know <b>what</b> I was talking about. He hasn't {{understood}} {{a word of}} it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his education, anyway? ...|$|R
60|$|But the archduke was {{not willing}} to give Richard up. A {{negotiation}} was, however, opened, and finally he consented to sell his prisoner for a large sum of money. The emperor took him away, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> {{him for a long time}} nobody knew.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, so far,' {{said the}} King, {{and he went}} on muttering over the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" [...] that's the jury, of course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" [...] why, that must be <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the tarts, you know--' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one thing for Mr. Buffin to do. Greatly as it would go against the grain, he must foregather with the man, win his confidence, put himself in a {{position}} where {{he would be able to}} find out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> himself when off duty.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Ronnie James Dio stated, [...] "I think Chris Cornell {{is such a}} great singer, {{and those}} guys [...] write so well and always write well — I mean, I love <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Audioslave and the things <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> since then." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{never worked}} under anybody {{to learn the}} art of movie making nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever go to any film school.

6000|$|... "Or be {{dismissed}} from his post," [...] I said, [...] "and replaced by some better sort of official. A man's none the less an official because <b>he's</b> irresponsible. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> his property affects people just the same. Private! No one is really private but an outlaw...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keller {{has become}} so bitter," [...] he said. [...] "His hasty temper I never complained of, as you know. But in these later days he is hard--hard as stone. Do you know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> dear Madame Fontaine's letter? A downright insult, David--he sent it back to her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{that your}} friend Francis {{must have been}} the hero who {{complains}} so grievously of Taffy the Welshman, whose house was doubtless situated in a field of barley, while his making a dreadful racket is quite according to the ancient notions of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the marrow-bone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must think}} it, else he wouldn't tell 'em. Now, 'cordin' to his story, {{some of them}} fellers was jest loaded with the stuff, and they put {{up the price of}} a {{railroad}} ticket back. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> himself {{while he was in the}} town, 'cause you can't make out anything by what he says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sperrit? Well, maybe," [...] he said. [...] "But there's {{one thing}} {{not clear to}} me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, <b>what's</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} he'll <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that fat hen," [...] muttered Blacky, {{as he watched}} Reddy race away with it thrown over his shoulders.

50|$|At a busy sawmill, Jaws, a {{front-end}} loader, {{explains how}} {{the trees are}} turned into lumber and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the cut logs.

60|$|He {{climbed on}} to an omnibus {{travelling}} West. Another twenty-four hours of starvation had begun. It did not matter at all <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> them. They were simply so much aching {{that had to be}} got through somehow--so much aching; and what relief at the end? An hour or two with her, desperately holding himself in.|$|E
60|$|Then {{at last he}} understood, and {{clutched}} the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> her eggs.|$|E
60|$|Forrest, however, {{fell back}} rapidly, and {{attacked}} the troops at Fort Pillow, a station {{for the protection}} of the navigation of the Mississippi River. The garrison consisted of a regiment of colored troops, infantry, and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry. These troops fought bravely, but were overpowered. I will leave Forrest in his dispatches to tell <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E
50|$|Puck (Mark Salling) {{has been}} {{encouraging}} Finn {{to go to}} Los Angeles with him to partner in his pool-cleaning business, but Finn decides he will be going with Rachel to New York as originally planned.

6000|$|... "She {{seems to}} think you are perfect, and she never comes here but she asks when you're to be home.
