50|$|A {{microsite}} is a {{term used}} in ecology to describe <b>a</b> pocket <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment with unique features, conditions or characteristics. Classifying different microsites may depend on temperature, humidity, sunlight, nutrient availability, soil physical characteristics, vegetation cover, etc. Being <b>a</b> sub environment <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment, we will examin the qualities that differentiate a microsite from another <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment in this piece.|$|R

5|$|Another {{analogous}} case <b>within</b> <b>a</b> single {{species has}} been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case}} of bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry <b>within</b> <b>a</b> single species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum <b>within</b> <b>a</b> population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine <b>within</b> <b>a</b> single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges <b>within</b> <b>a</b> single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E

50|$|Grazing {{pressure}} is {{the demand for}} feed from herbivores and detritivores <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment. This could come from domestic animal, such as goats and cattle, feral animals, such as rabbits, and native animals, such as kangaroos or moose. Total grazing pressure reflects the total demand from all herbivores <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment... Grazing pressure that occurs naturally <b>within</b> <b>an</b> environment is higher than grazing pressure from livestock animals. The predominant dietary component in herbivores diet is grass.|$|R

40|$|In {{dispersed}} single beta cells {{the response}} of each cell to glucose is heterogeneous. In contrast, <b>within</b> <b>an</b> islet, cell-to-cell communication leads to glucose inducing a more homogeneous response. For example, increases in NAD(P) H and calcium are relatively uniform across {{the cells of the}} islet. These data suggest that secretion of insulin from single beta cells <b>within</b> <b>an</b> islet should also be relatively homogeneous. The aim {{of this study was to}} test this hypothesis by determining the glucose dependence of single-cell insulin responses <b>within</b> <b>an</b> islet...|$|R

The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours on-duty and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers).
