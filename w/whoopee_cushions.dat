5000|$|To use it, {{a person}} must first inflate it with air, then {{place it on}} a chair or squeeze it. Some <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushions</b> can be self-inflating. If it is placed on a chair, an unsuspecting victim will sit on the whoopee cushion, forcing {{the air out of}} the opening, which causes the flap to vibrate and create a loud, flatulence-like sound.|$|E

5000|$|Vincent Canby {{wrote in}} The New York Times that [...] "Nuns on the Run {{is a great}} leveler. It makes {{everyone}} in the audience feel a rascally 8 years old, {{the age at which}} <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushions</b> (when they work) seem the greatest invention since firecrackers." [...] Owen Gleiberman wrote in one of Entertainment Weeklys first issues that the film [...] "isnt a madcap-hysterical, end-of-the-empire drag farce; it doesnt hash over what Monty Python did definitively over 20 years ago. Its a cleverly directed caper comedy about two crooks on the lam, and it has its fair share of chuckles." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{practical}} joke is [...] "practical" [...] {{because it}} consists of someone doing something physical, {{in contrast to a}} verbal or written joke. For example, the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a doorway and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. Objects can also be used in practical jokes, like fake vomit, chewing gum bugs, exploding cigars, stink bombs, costumes and <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushions.</b>|$|E
50|$|In May 2002, as Thursday’s signing to Island Def Jam {{had become}} imminent, the band {{released}} a statement through their website detailing the internal problems with Victory and reasons for leaving. According to the statement, the band had higher aspirations for the album art which were dashed by Tony Brummel's desire to keep costs down. During a visit to Victory offices, they also discovered that for promotional purposes, the label made Thursday <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushions</b> which were intended to be distributed to fans at the Warped Tour. The idea was conceived without Thursday’s consent and stopped. The band continually emphasized the need to communicate regarding art direction and promotion but were allegedly ignored by Brummel and told that Victory was too big to run everything past its artists.|$|E

Melina is a mystery to everyone who knows her! Despite being extremely smart and first in class without lifting a single finger, Melina loooves picking her nose, sticking <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushions</b> on the teacher’s chair or devising the craziest of traps, {{with the purpose of}} ridiculing anyone and everyone around her! Even Zoé sometimes thinks she goes too far! ...|$|E

50|$|At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla {{think they}} are alone, but the other club members {{secretly}} pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (<b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion,</b> cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla {{to hide in the}} closet, which causes her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down.|$|R
5000|$|The Monty Python mode of {{presenting}} the tune {{was with a}} single strike of the bell, lifted from the third section and increased in volume, followed by a strain {{of each of the}} first two sections, followed by the famous stomping foot and a noticeably flatulent [...] "splat" [...] sound reminiscent of a <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion.</b> (The first episodes, however, used a [...] "hiss.") At {{the end of the film}} Monty Python: Live At The Hollywood Bowl, the entire march was played over the closing credits.|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} joke {{device is}} a manufactured prop or toy intended to confuse, frighten, or amuse individuals as a prank. Often, these objects are harmless facsimiles of disgusting or terrifying objects, such as vomit or spilled nail polish. In other instances, they are created as seemingly harmless items designed to humorously malfunction {{in such a}} way as to confuse or harm the target of a prank. The devices are frequently sold in magic or specialty shops, purchased over the Internet, or crafted for oneself. Perhaps the most notable such device is the <b>Whoopee</b> <b>cushion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Maris {{was born}} in 1952 in Seattle. Her father was {{referred}} to as [...] "The Commodore". She also has at least two sisters, one named Bree, who was born with only one nostril; she is mentioned as Frasier's date in one episode. As a child, Maris was overweight, but started losing weight and soon became very thin. She is described as small, very pale, and pathologically emaciated; Roz originally mistook her for a hat rack, and Niles noted that she once sat on a <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> without setting it off.|$|R
5000|$|The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, [...] "Geoff Miller {{concedes that}} he {{probably}} enjoyed cricket too much. He did not take it as seriously as some, And when it became a rigorous, grim-faced business, he was not sorry to bow out of an eight-year Test career that never reached the peaks many expected". Likewise Simon Hughes referred to Miller in 1990 as being [...] "the only remaining player who unfailingly visited the opposing team's dressing room after play to thank them for the game ... and the last man to field at slip with a <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> up his jumper" ...|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "slapstick" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} Italian language word batacchio or bataccio — called the [...] "slap stick" [...] in English — a club-like object {{composed of two}} wooden slats used in commedia dell'arte. When struck, the batacchio produces a loud smacking noise, though little force transfers from the object to the person being struck. Actors may thus hit one another repeatedly with great audible effect while causing no damage and only very minor, if any, pain. Along with the inflatable bladder (of which the <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> is a modern variant), it was among the earliest special effects.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{a form of}} <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> {{was known}} in ancient Rome, the modern version was re-invented in the 1920s by the JEM Rubber Co. of Toronto, Canada, by {{employees}} who were experimenting with scrap sheets of rubber. The owner of the company approached Samuel Sorenson Adams, the inventor of numerous practical jokes and owner of S.S. Adams Co., with the newly invented item. Adams said that the item was [...] "too vulgar" [...] and would never sell. JEM Rubber offered the idea to the Johnson Smith Company which sold it with great success. S.S.

25|$|While the act {{of passing}} flatus in said {{cultures}} is {{generally considered to be}} an unfortunate occurrence in public settings, flatulence may, in casual circumstances and especially among children, be used as either a humorous supplement to a joke ("pull my finger"), or as a comic activity in and of itself. The social acceptability of flatulence-based humour in entertainment and the mass media varies over the course of time and between cultures. Enough entertainers performed with their flatus that the term flatulist was coined. The <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> is a joking device invented in the early 20th century for simulating a fart. In 2008, a farting application for the iPhone earned nearly $10,000 in one day.|$|R
50|$|For 15 years Cox {{has been}} {{communicating}} acoustic engineering {{to the public}} working on projects worth over £1 million.

50|$|Once on the island, {{it turns}} out that Muffy has set up a variety of pranks {{throughout}} the mansion, ranging from simple gags such as a <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> and dribble glasses and exploding cigars to more complex and disturbing pranks, such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. In spite of this, the group try to relax, until Skip goes missing, and Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing. During a search for the pair, Nikki falls into the island's well, where she finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch, along with the dead body of Nan. The remaining group members then discover that the phone lines are dead {{and there is no way}} to get off the island until Monday.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{functioning}} as normal organs (actually working as intended being a {{deviation from the}} norm), Johnson's instruments include a number of less conventional voices. The UU organ, for example, includes such voices as Vox Dei, Thunderstorm, <b>Whoopee</b> <b>Cushion,</b> Squashed Toad, Humorous Chicken Squawk and Squashed Rabbits, {{in addition to the}} [...] "terrae motus", or Earthquake Pipe—although no-one is allowed to use it since the time it caused the University to move several inches on its foundations (and caused acute bowel discomfort in a quarter {{of the population of the}} city). This organ's other major feature are the 14 stops marked '?'. The organ at Don'tgonearthe Castle was specially built to accommodate the tastes of a traditionalist vampire, and features the specialist voices of Wolf Howl, Thunderclap, Scream and Creaky Floors. Its chord generators, for example 'Ghastly Face at Window', play various combinations of the voices.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>whoopee</b> (or whoopie) <b>cushion,</b> {{also known}} as a farting bag, poo-poo cushion, windy blaster, and Razzberry Cushion, is a {{practical}} joke device involving flatulence humour, which produces a noise resembling a [...] "raspberry" [...] or human flatulence. It is made from two sheets of rubber that are glued together at the edges. There is a small opening with a flap at one end for air to enter and leave the cushion.|$|R
5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} Night Howlers for Dragon magazine #192 (April 1993). He {{says that}} Night Howlers [...] "achieves its modest goals quite successfully, providing slick, straightforward guidelines for incorporating lycanthropic PCs into Dungeons & Dragons campaigns". He cautions that players will require [...] "a high tolerance for the system's eccentricities", since D&D lycanthropes can't be harmed by ordinary weapons, and include [...] "oddball variants". He notes that while {{keeping track of}} two sets of character statistics [...] "sounds like a chore", but the Werecreature Character Record Sheet [...] "makes it snap". He felt that acquiring special abilities through level advancement was [...] "a nice touch that encourages players to stick with their lycanthropic PCs though a campaign". He considers Chaotic [...] "the most difficult alignment to play effectively" [...] but calls the saving throw when transforming to retain the alignment of the human form [...] "a good rule, strongly recommended". Swan felt that the role-playing tips [...] "address only the most obvious aspects of a werecreature's split personality", commenting that Dupuis [...] "seems more interested in physiology than psychology, making the book less useful than it could've been". He felt that the strongest material in Night Howlers deals with staging adventures, and called the scenario outlines [...] "Best of all" [...] because they are [...] "designed to take optimum advantage of lycanthropic characters". Swan felt that Night Howlers [...] "lacks the atmosphere and spectacle of the Werewolf game", which he also reviewed in the same column, and concluded his review by saying: [...] "but it delivers the goods to D&D game players who want to shake up their campaigns. Unlike Werewolf, Night Howlers accommodates {{a wide range of}} playing styles, from high fantasy to low comedy (humor is about as welcome in Werewolf as a <b>whoopee</b> <b>cushion</b> at a funeral). The clear, direct writing and clutter-free presentation enables DMs to incorporate lycanthropic characters with a minimum of fuss. I suggest going easy at first—the powerful shapeshifting PCs tend to give their uninfected companions inferiority complexes—but used judiciously, Night Howlers can produce some of the wildest D&D sessions you've ever experienced." ...|$|R
