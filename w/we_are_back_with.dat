White Miles offered their condolences on that day as well, saying: [...] "We are happy, but miserable at the same time. Happy, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> our families, who help immensely to make us feel safe again; miserable, because we know that many families have to mourn following the weekend." [...] On 8 December, nearly a month after the attacks, Eagles of Death Metal revisited the Bataclan to pay their respects to the victims.|$|E

30|$|For {{the future}} of the {{transportation}} network, two types of interface seem crucial: the shared vehicle interface, which is critical for the co-evolution of operations and customers with their patterns of usage; and the interfaces with users to facilitate connections with other transportation modes (in particular parking and mass transit systems).

40|$|Implicit {{contracts}} {{were initially}} {{seen as a}} form of insurance. Workers bought a less variable wage at the expense of a slightly lower average wage. But as long as this idea of implicit contracts persisted, they could do little to explain unemployment.

He might do so if the disutility of labour or the level of unemployment benefit were high enough, but in such cases <b>we</b> <b>are</b> effectively <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the classical version of unemployment...|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> {{our second}} article on clandestine drug labs. Our first {{article in the}} series {{provided}} an introduction to “clan labs, ” provided a little history and background on the epidemic, and briefly discussed the three phase approach taking the site from discovery to final clean up. After a clan lab is found, specially trained law enforcement personnel must often deal with possible booby traps while securing the site. Crime scene investigators can then move in and process the site for evidence. Following the securing and processing of the clan lab {{we move into the}} next phase, which is categorizing the chemicals and wastes and removing the gross contamination from the site. This article discusses the different methods used to make the illegal drugs at clandestine laboratories, the chemicals involved in those methods, and the hazards associated with those chemicals. In our original article we noted that clan labs can manufacture stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and narcotics. However, in 2004 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) found that ninety eight percent (98 %) of seized laboratories were producing methamphetamine. 1 Obviously, the health and safety concerns vary based on the type of drug manufactured and the production method used, but given this fact we will focus on methamphetamine production methods...|$|E
40|$|In the Bellary {{region of}} Karnataka in South India, and {{not far from}} the picturesque Hampi Ruins – of the medieval Bijayanagara Empire – on the stony banks of the river Tungdabhadra, stands the new and {{glittering}} empire of the steel magnet Jindals (see articles inside). The mega steel plant is complete with its own airport, tree-line avenues, and a huge sprawling campus guarded by a private security force. According to the Jindal website, it is a profit-making and growing concern, which symbolizes India's industrial growth, ensuring the growth of the GDP and the national economy—something that the country can be 'justly proud ' of.

Westfall said the band completed the final [...] "few songs when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> home <b>with</b> Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert)." [...] On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: [...] "It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time." [...] On the songs themselves, he said: [...] "the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote it like that, it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge". The album was influenced by Finch's What It Is to Burn (2002). The album [...] "came together song by song" [...] as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15–16 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an {{interview with}} Rocksound that there's songs [...] "that didn't make this record that we're saving."

60|$|Grey Abbey {{is one of}} {{the largest}} but by no means one of the most picturesque demesnes in Ireland. It is {{situated}} in the county of Kildare, about two miles from the little town of Kilcullen, in a flat, uninteresting, and not very fertile country. The park itself is extensive and tolerably well wooded, but it wants water and undulation, and is deficient of any object of attraction, except that of size and not very magnificent timber. I suppose, years ago, there was an Abbey here, or near the spot, but there is now no vestige of it remaining. In a corner of the demesne there are standing the remains of one of those strong, square, ugly castles, which, two centuries since, were the real habitations of the landed proprietors of the country, and many of which have been inhabited even to a much later date. They now afford the strongest record of the apparently miserable state of life which even the favoured of the land then endured, and of the numberless domestic comforts which years and skill have given us, apt as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to look <b>back</b> <b>with</b> fond regret to the happy, by-gone days of past periods.|$|R

"In a short time, small {{bodies of}} {{soldiers}} {{ran across the}} open where the shells were still bursting thickly, established themselves {{in the ruins of}} the village, and, as they received reinforcements, gradually worked their way forwards.

Thank God, the end of this terrible business is approaching, and by to-morrow morning we may see the troops in Passy, where there is scarce a soul but will welcome them with open arms.

5000|$|John Mason Brown {{wrote in}} the New York Post: [...] "It is not often in our {{lifetime}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> privileged to enjoy the pleasant sensation of feeling that {{the present and the}} future have met for a few triumphant hours.... Yet it was this very sensation—this uncommon sensation of having the present and future meet; eye-witnessing the kind of event to which <b>we</b> will <b>be</b> looking <b>back</b> <b>with</b> pride in the years to come—that forced its warming way, I suspect, into the consciousness of many of us last night as we sat spellbound. Miss Cornell's Juliet is luscious and charming. It finds her at her mellowest and most glamorous. It burns with the intensity Miss Cornell brings to all her acting. It moves gracefully and lightly; it is endlessly haunting in its pictorial qualities; and reveals a Miss Cornell who equals the beauty of the lyric lines she speaks with a new-found lyric beauty of her own voice.... To add that it is by all odds the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present-day theatre has seen is only to toss it the kind of superlative it honestly deserves." [...] Later, the same critic determined that this role was a turning point in her career, as it meant that she could finally leave the [...] "trifling scripts" [...] of her earlier career and could meet the challenging demands of the greatest classic roles.|$|R
60|$|My dearest Sarianna,--You {{will like}} to hear, if {{only by a}} scratch, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> in Tuscany <b>with</b> all safety, after a very {{pleasant}} journey through an almost absolute solitude. Florence is perfectly tranquil {{and at the same}} time most unusually animated, what with the French troops and the passionate gratitude of the people. We have two great flags on our terrace, the French flag and the Italian, and Peni keeps a moveable little flag between them, which (as he says) 'he can take out in the carriage sometimes.' Pen is enchanted with the state of things in general, and the French camp in particular, which he came home from only in the dusk last night, having 'enjoyed himself so very much in seeing those dear French soldiers play at blindman's buff.' They won't, however, remain long here, unless the Austrians threaten to come down on us, which, I trust, they will be too much absorbed to do. The melancholy point in all this is the dirt eaten and digested with a calm face by England and the English. Now that I have exhausted myself with indignation and protestation, Robert has taken up the same note, which is a comfort. I would rather hear my own heart in his voice. Certainly it must be still more bitter for him than for me, seeing that he has more national predilections than I have, and has struggled longer to see differently. Not only the prestige, but the very respectability of England is utterly lost here--and nothing less is expected than her ultimate and open siding with Austria in the war. If she does, we shall wash our hands like so many Pilates, which will save us but not England.|$|R
