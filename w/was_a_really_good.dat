5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

500|$|Scottish indie-rock band Arab Strap {{referred}} to this episode in the lyrics of their debut single [...] "The First Big Weekend" [...] ("Sunday afternoon we go up to John's {{with a lot of}} beer in time to watch The Simpsons - it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer. It was quite moving at the end and {{to tell you the truth}} my eyes were a bit damp").|$|E

500|$|Mark Kermode {{walked out}} on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised {{his view of the}} film over time. In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, {{you have to be very}} careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pam came up {{with the}} title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we {{immediately}} became inspired and began working on the music. You know, when we hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> episode, and even wished {{it could have}} been turned into a movie, were Fringe to get into filmmaking. Josh Wigler of MTV thought it was a [...] "pretty cool" [...] mystery-of-the-week, and [...] "while not quite as strong as when the mythology is in full gear, 'What Lies Below' was {{nonetheless}} a compelling hour of television." [...] He was however bothered that there was no further information about the parallel universe. UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben compared [...] "What Lies Below" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Ice". Zalben concluded, [...] "Though both episodes are very good, 'Ice' {{is one of the best}} X-Files hours ever, perfectly channeling – but not ripping off – John Carpenter's The Thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Jimi Hendrix {{began his}} career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and {{performed}} and recorded with several popular R artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording. [...] Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963. [...] He described the experience: [...] "The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. [...] Curtis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> guitarist... I learned a lot in that short time. [...] He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know". [...] In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled [...] "(My Girl) She's a Fox" [...] with the Icemen, an R duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as [...] "paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [...] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'". [...] Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to [...] "She's a Fox" [...] (included on the 2010 [...] ) [...] "perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career. [...] Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute".|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney finally stated, in his Wingspan {{documentary}} in May 2001, {{that the}} sacking of Pete Best {{had nothing to}} do with his ability as a drummer. Explaining why one particular member of his subsequent band, Wings, [...] "didn't last long" [...] in that group McCartney said: [...] "It's like in the Beatles, we had Pete Best, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> drummer, but there just was something, he wasn't quite like the rest of us, we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all, but it's a fine line, you know, as to what is exactly in and what is nearly in. So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I {{think one of the most}} powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> song to start out on, because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E
2500|$|... "Milkshake" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, {{better known as}} The Neptunes. The song came out when Tasty {{was chosen as the}} album's title. When making the song, Kelis [...] "knew right away that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> song", and she wanted it to be the album's first single. Recording sessions took place at Hovercraft Studios in Virginia. Phil Tan mixed the recordings at Right Track Studios in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Israel {{claims that}} the attack impeded Iraq's nuclear ambitions by at least ten years. In an {{interview}} in 2005, Bill Clinton expressed support for the attack: [...] "everybody talks about what the Israelis did at Osiraq, in 1981, which, I think, in retrospect, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> thing. You know, it kept Saddam from developing nuclear power." [...] Louis René Beres wrote in 1995 that [...] "ad {{it not been for}} the brilliant raid at Osiraq, Saddam's forces might have been equipped with atomic warheads in 1991." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eppley {{joined the}} faculty as an {{assistant}} professor of agronomy in 1922, and in 1926, he earned a master of arts degree from what was by then known as the University of Maryland. He became the Maryland track coach during the 1930s, and his teams won two national championships. Jim Kehoe, who was on one of Eppley's track teams and himself later became track coach and athletic director, said, [...] "I thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> coach ... He was very aggressive, very well informed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Deny Thy Father", the two-part December 2005 crossover, stars Casualty MacCorkindale, Bleasdale, Packer, Wait, Cookson, Thorp, Mellor and Carling, {{as well as}} Clinical Nurse Specialist Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) and {{receptionist}} Sam Bateman (Luke Bailey). Mealing, Quarshie, Jacobs and Clarke of the Holby City cast also star, {{along with}} general surgical registrar Nick Jordan (Michael French) and midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Thorp's character was killed off during the second episode. The actor praised the crossover, commenting: [...] "Filming it was like filming a feature film. Massive stunts and good storylines. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> buzz on set all the time... As an actor, you couldn't wish for a better exit. It was absolutely brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1987, INXS entered Rhinoceros Studios in Sydney {{to begin}} {{recording}} Kick, their sixth studio album, and second with Thomas.

Nicolas co-owned Rhinoceros recordings and had previously worked with the band on their 1982 album, Shabooh Shoobah, five years earlier. In the band's 2005 official autobiography – INXS: Story to Story, Nicholas was optimistic about the album's production as he recalls, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> feeling in the studio {{that this was going to}} be something big. The band had just come off a really successful tour of the US on the back of Listen Like Thieves, which really broke them there and they were on fire".|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Sir Alex Ferguson {{paid tribute}} to the {{spectacle}} of the event, saying, [...] "It was fantastic.

[...] Marcello Lippi was equally effusive about the performances on show: [...] "It {{was meant to be a}} celebration and it was.

[...] Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. [...] "...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We {{put a lot of}} time into this episode," [...] Havins stated. [...] "We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal." [...] She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. [...] "And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> feeling.
