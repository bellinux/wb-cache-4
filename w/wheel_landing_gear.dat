500|$|The prototype, {{internally}} {{designated as}} aircraft or TIS [...] "A", was a low-wing, all-metal, cantilever monoplane with two Mikulin AM-37 engines and a twin tail. The monocoque fuselage had four [...] ShKAS machine {{guns in the}} nose, each with 1,000 rounds. The pilot and the gunner/radio-operator were seated back-to-back, separated by an armor plate, under sliding canopies. The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS-1 mount with 750 rounds {{that could be used}} once his canopy was slid forward. He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns. The ventral gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition. A [...] UBK machine gun with 400 rounds and a [...] ShVAK cannon with 350 rounds were mounted in each wing root. Underneath the wings were two racks each capable of carrying a single [...] FAB-500 bomb. The wing had automatic leading edge slats and four split flaps separated by the engine nacelles. The single <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> retracted into the rear part of the nacelles, as did the tailwheel into the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|Ilyushin Company chief {{designer}} Sergey Gromov {{announced that}} they will develop {{a version of the}} Il-114 aircraft fitted with ski and <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the Arctic Region. The development program will produce three Il-114 aircraft by 2020 with Gidromash/Hydromash JSC (Nizhny Novgorod). It will be designated Il-114-300 and will be produced using only Russian-produced components. Four versions of Il-114-300 would be developed including a passenger version by 2019; Cargo and Arctic versions derived from the passenger version, and a Maritime Patrol Aircraft, whose prototype was showcased at Army-2015 forum.|$|E
50|$|The Hurricane {{was then}} in an {{advanced}} design stage {{and there would}} be economies of scale if some assemblies were common to both aircraft. This resulted in the Henley, as it was to become known, sharing identical outer wing panel and tailplane jigs with the Hurricane. Both were equipped with the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine as it offered the best power-weight ratio as well as a minimal frontal area. The Henley’s cantilever fabric-covered monoplane wing was mid-set, a retractable tail <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was selected and accommodation provided for a pilot and observer/air gunner, which differed from the Hurricane’s single-seat cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|Félix du Temple {{patented}} {{the designs}} for his aerial machine in 1857, which incorporated a retractable <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> a propeller, a 6 hp engine and a dihedral wing design, {{under the title}} [...] "Locomotion aérienne par imitation du vol des oiseaux" [...] ("Aerial locomotion by imitation of the flight of birds"). He built several large models together with his brother Luis. One of them, weighing 700 grams, was able to fly, first using a clockwork mechanism as an engine, and then using a miniature steam engine. The two brothers managed to make the models take off under their own power, fly a short distance and land safely.|$|E
50|$|Two-place model {{introduced}} in 2006, BHPA certified in 2007 {{and still in}} production in 2012, made from 7075-T6 aluminum tubing. Has optional fixed <b>wheeled</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with bungee suspension.|$|R
50|$|The Heinkel He 59 was a German biplane {{designed}} in 1930 {{resulting from a}} requirement for a torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft able to operate on <b>wheeled</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> or twin-floats.|$|R
50|$|Floatplanes {{often have}} floats that are {{interchangeable}} with <b>wheeled</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (thereby producing a conventional land-based aircraft) however {{in cases where}} this is not practical amphibious floatplanes, such as the amphibious version of the DHC Otter, incorporate retractable wheels within their floats.|$|R
5000|$|The ROKS-Aero {{corporation}} {{was set up}} in Moscow in 1990 {{to design}} and manufacture general aviation aircraft, but was renamed Aeroprogress in 1993. In 1992 ROKS-Aero started design of a single-engined light aircraft, the T-411 Aist 2. Construction of the prototype T-411 started in April 1993, making its maiden flight on 10 November 1993. The Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center set up an aviation department in 1994 and purchased a license to build the Aist. The airframe, however, is produced by Production complex #2 of RAC MIG. It is a high-wing braced monoplane with a tubular-steel fuselage and metal fabric covered wings. [...] The T-411 is powered by a 360 hp Vedeneyev M14P radial piston engine and has either a fixed tail <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> or can be fitted with floats.|$|E
50|$|The SK-1 was {{a wooden}} two-seat mid-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a V-tail and {{powered by a}} Turbomeca Palas turbojet mounted above the mid-fuselage. It had a retractable nose wheel and single main <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with retractable wingtip outriggers and seating in tandem for two under a one-piece canopy. The SK-1 was designed by Hugh Kendall and built by Somers-Kendall Aircraft Limited, a company he set up with Nat Somers a racing pilot. Built between 1954 and 1955 at Woodley the aircraft registered G-AOBG was first flown on 8 October 1955. The aircraft flown by Nat Somers made an attempt at a 100 km closed circuit speed record for its class but it was frustrated by landing gear problems. The aircraft was retired and stored following an engine failure prior to take-off on 11 July 1957.|$|E
5000|$|The name Chardonneret (Goldfinch) {{was applied}} to the three {{completed}} examples of the first post-war designs from the Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre (SNCAC) company at Bourges. The NC.832, NC.840 and NC.841 trio differed chiefly in their engines and the number of people they could hold. The Chardonnerets were all high-wing, braced cabin monoplanes. The NC.832 was powered by a [...] four cylinder inline inverted air-cooled Régnier 4E.O engine and carried three. It had a tail wheel undercarriage and first flew on 3 November 1946. The other two were both four-seaters. The NC.840 had a [...] Renault 4Pei engine of similar configuration to the Régnier and a tricycle wheel undercarriage. The NC.841 had a [...] Mathis 175H radial engine and a tail wheel undercarriage. Although the aircraft did not sell, the experience was used in the tail <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> NC.850.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit, an inflatable boat hull {{and a single}} engine in pusher configuration. The FIB has no <b>wheeled</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> {{but as a result}} of customer demand it was later developed into the amphibious Polaris AM-FIB.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s the company offered a version {{with the same}} wing, but without a boat hull, using a {{conventional}} minimalist trike frame mounted on <b>wheeled</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> or optionally skis. Even though {{it did not have}} a boat hull it was still marketed under the FIB name.|$|R
