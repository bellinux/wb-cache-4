5|$|After World War II, Ohmsen {{initially}} {{worked as}} a government employee of the Schleswig-Holstein agricultural ministry. He ran for public office as a candidate of the Schleswig-Holstein-Block in the 1954 Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein election. During an election speech, he disparaged the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Friedrich-Wilhelm Lübke. Ohmsen was immediately dismissed <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> from his position in the agricultural ministry for insulting the Minister-President. He rejoined the military service of the Bundeswehr on 16 March 1956 as a Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) of the Bundesmarine (German Federal Navy). He was promoted to Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) on 15 November 1957 and Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) on 13 August 1965 and retired on 30 September 1967.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 {{permission}} {{was granted}} to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission {{was given to the}} Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.|$|E
5|$|Carmella {{admits she}} {{arranged}} {{the sale of}} her cousin Teresa's (Hannah Greenwood) unwanted baby. A fellow nun suggests that she takes time off from the convent. She complies and leaves {{her role as a}} nun behind. Teresa has a breakdown and throws a saucepan of boiling water at Carmella, who is left with severe facial scarring and becomes increasingly secluded. She is convinced by Will Griggs (Christian Clark) to have plastic surgery to lessen the scarring. Ned tells Carmella that he loves her, but Carmella has fallen in love with Will. Soon thereafter, Will leaves the country <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b> His younger brother Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) arrives, and explains that Will had a double identity. Carmella has short-lived relationships with Oliver and teenager Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). She becomes addicted to prescription drugs, and later discovers that she is pregnant with Oliver's baby, and may have harmed the baby through her addiction.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b> After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator {{complains}} to Tyler about Tyler excluding {{him from}} the newer manifestation of the Fight Club organization Project Mayhem. Soon after, Tyler leaves the house <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b> When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries {{to shut down the}} project. Seeking Tyler, he follows evidence of Tyler's national travels. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. Tyler suddenly appears in his hotel room, and reveals that they are dissociated personalities in the same body. When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing {{him that he had}} seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b> Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E

5|$|In 1236, Duke Vykintas led the Samogitian {{forces to}} victory in the Battle of Saule, where the Livonian Order {{suffered}} a catastrophic defeat. It seems that Vykintas did not receive support from Mindaugas. Vykintas' personal power grew. The Livonian Order {{was on the brink}} of collapse and was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights. The combined Orders focused on the conquest of Samogitia, since only this land prevented them from consolidating their territories. The union of these aggressive powers could not have passed <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> in Lithuanian lands, and might have furthered the unification process. In about 1239 Mindaugas took over the weakened Black Ruthenia and appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern it. During the early 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic lands. In 1245, Mindaugas sent his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas, the sons of Dausprungas and Vykintas, to conquer Smolensk, but they were unsuccessful. In 1249, an internal war erupted as Mindaugas sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b>|$|E
