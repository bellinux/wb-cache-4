5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Upon Lee's {{return from}} the army, Whitney gives the {{relationship}} another chance. She struggles {{with the prospect of}} making their romance sexual, but eventually agrees to <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> his feelings for her.

500|$|Pinter {{was content}} {{in his second}} {{marriage}} and enjoyed family life with his six adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren. Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself [...] "a very lucky man in every respect". [...] Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New York Times that his [...] "latest work, a slim pamphlet called [...] "Six Poems for A.," [...] comprises poems written over 32 years, with [...] "A" [...] of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> his wife." [...] In that interview Pinter [...] "acknowledged that his plays—full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot—seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I've {{never been able to}} write a happy play, but I've been able to enjoy a happy life. [...] After his death, Fraser told The Guardian: [...] "He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rey now {{talks about}} the impostor topic on less serious, even humorous tone, to help forget the {{traumatic}} experience it had caused. Looking back, he even dubbed his impostor [...] "Rey Bolero" [...] ( [...] Rey the Deceiver / Smooth Talker [...] ) <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> it to his friends and interviews, which was also mentioned on the [...] "Na-Scam Ka Na Ba" [...] interview on the Filipino television channel QTV11 which aired around September 2006.|$|E

Cosick is about to come inside when a boy on the street accidentally turns on a spotlight that blinds Robert, and he falls from the ledge. He manages to grab a net {{that the police had}} stealthily put below him, and he is hauled into the hotel. Dunnigan is greeted by his wife and son, and Danny and Ruth walk the street hand in hand.|$|E
2500|$|The studio did {{not like}} Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson [...] two of Stone's {{original}} choices. The director briefly considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon." [...] When the actor met the director he {{got the impression that}} Stone was [...] "one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away." [...] What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and [...] "impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> his mother and father. That affected me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t mean you have to play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins {{selected}} [...] "Arabian Knights" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{some of his}} favourite {{music on}} BBC radio: commenting the song, he said that [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were able to unlock certain rhythms and feelings that are still in alt rock today".|$|R
50|$|Brian was {{a pretty}} intimidating guy, and could be {{overwhelming}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> music, but music was all he was. At his house, there were albums everywhere. His basement was floor to ceiling records. They were on his stairs and in hallways. I've {{never seen so many}} albums in my life.|$|R

2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've {{talked to him about}} it, OK? I can tell <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script. Idem Paris, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a music video directed by Lynch for the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Came Back Haunted" [...] was released. He also did photography for the self-titled album from Dumb Numbers released August 2013.|$|E
