5|$|Sailing to Senegal {{and then}} Cayenne, La Meillerie's {{operations}} {{had little effect}} and by 18 May he <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return journey to France, hoping to anchor in the Biscay port of Rochefort. On 27 July, the frigates were spotted by HMS Mars, a ship {{of the line of}} the British blockade squadron, and chased with the frigate Rhin rapidly falling behind. Declining to support the straggler, La Meillerie ran on towards France while Mars took possession of Rhin, and the surviving ships found safe ports along the Biscay coast.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, {{with whom he had}} a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{mismanagement}} {{and internal}} disputes led to {{delays in the}} project. By the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in late 1854, {{a number of other}} cemeteries had opened nearer to London or {{were in the process of}} opening. While some parishes in London did arrange for the LNC to handle the burials of their dead, many preferred to use nearer cemeteries. The LNC had anticipated handling between 10,000 and 50,000 burials per year, but the number never rose above 4,100 per year, and in its first 150 years of operations only 231,730 burials had been conducted. Buying the land for Brookwood Cemetery and building the cemetery and railway had been very expensive, and by the time the cemetery opened the LNC <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of bankruptcy. The LNC remained solvent by selling surplus parts of its land, but as the land had been chosen in the first place for its remoteness, sales were low.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|A {{major threat}} <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon, however, as the Rothesay Dock in Clydebank was under construction. It opened in 1907, {{equipped}} with modern {{mechanical handling equipment}} for bulk minerals; it was only 20miles (32km) {{from most of the}} coalfields, and sea-going ships could be loaded there. Much traffic was immediately diverted from Ardrossan, and use of the expensive new L route declined steeply.|$|E

Investigations will try to determine why ET1021 was cleared for departure before ET1016 (the train coming from the opposite direction) had arrived at Andria station. On , the station masters of both Corato and Andria were placed under investigation for their roles in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{designated}} as KBAY-TV, the construction permit for the station went through many owners from the 1950s onward. The KEMO call letters were originally assigned to U.S. Communications, a broadcaster owned by Daniel H. Overmyer, {{owner of the}} short-lived Overmyer Network (later called the United Network); Overmyer used his initials as the last three letters of the Toledo, Ohio station (WDHO-TV, now WNWO-TV), which <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air, and his children's initials for the remaining five stations in his network, whose licenses were not granted until December 12, 1967, after his network folded.|$|E

During his time in secondary school, he was also influenced by Michel Bréal, a leading French philologist who was the grandfather of one of his classmates.

The other alleged terrorists named on that date were Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who had also been earlier listed with Ghailani by the FBI as a Most Wanted Terrorist for the 1998 embassy attack, and Abderraouf Jdey, Amer El-Maati, Aafia Siddiqui, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, and Adnan G.

25|$|On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{was trying}} {{to break up a}} group of late revelers {{shooting}} at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He attempted to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and had not noticed that Brocius' pistol <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder.|$|E

25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|E
25|$|Lacy-Potter Television Broadcasting lost $128,020 in {{net revenue}} during its four-month {{stewardship}} of KBTV, leading Tom Potter {{to make the}} decision to put the station up for sale. The A.H. Belo Corporation, owner of The Dallas Morning News, had attempted to launch a new television station in Dallas two years earlier, when it applied for a construction permit to build transmitter and broadcasting facilities for a proposed station that would have transmitted on VHF channel 12. The FCC rejected Belo's application and, following the issuance of the Sixth Report and Order in 1952, eventually chose to reassign the Channel 12 allocation to Waco (after the agency assigned that same channel to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where it would be licensed to KXII, the FCC would eventually move the VHF channel 12 allocation from Waco to Abilene, which became home to present-day ABC affiliate KTXS-TV). Complicating matters, the agency's moratorium on new license applications, which the FCC instituted to sort out the backlog of prospective applicants that already filed to build such operations, left Belo with the sole recourse of acquiring a television station that <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air if it wanted to own one in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.|$|E
25|$|New Netherlanders {{were not}} {{necessarily}} Dutch, and New Netherland was never a homogeneous society. An early governor, Peter Minuit, was a Walloon born in modern Germany who spoke English and worked for a Dutch company. The term New Netherland Dutch generally includes all the Europeans who came to live there, but may also refer to Africans, Indo-Caribbeans, South Americans and even the Native Americans who were integral to the society. Though Dutch was the official language, and likely the lingua franca of the province, it was but one of many spoken there. There were various Algonquian languages; Walloons and Huguenots tended to speak French, and Scandinavians brought their own tongues, as did the Germans. It {{is likely that the}} about 100 Africans (including both free men and slaves) on Manhattan spoke their mother tongues, but were taught Dutch from 1638 by Adam Roelantsz van Dokkum. English <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rise to become the vehicular language in world trade, and settlement by individuals or groups of English-speakers started soon after the inception of the province. The arrival of refugees from New Holland in Brazil may have brought speakers of Portuguese, Spanish, and Ladino (with Hebrew as a liturgical language). Commercial activity in the harbor could have been transacted simultaneously in any of a number of tongues.|$|E
