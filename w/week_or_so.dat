5|$|September's {{counterpart}} to Sundance, the Toronto International Film Festival, is {{held at the}} end of the month. The film community's attention is focused on the Canadian city. Critics gather to see potential Oscar contenders among the many independent films on the program and studio executives look to line up distribution deals with the same prize in mind. Some of the best are released within a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> ending the September dump period.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a <b>week</b> (<b>or</b> <b>so)</b> after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E

5|$|Until a road {{could be}} opened from Lae, the Kaiapit area {{could only be}} {{supplied}} by air {{and there were a}} limited number of transport aircraft. Even flying in an airborne engineer aviation battalion to improve the airstrip would have involved taking aircraft away from operations supporting the 7th Division at Nadzab. Moreover, Whitehead warned that he could not guarantee adequate air support for both Kaiapit and the upcoming Finschhafen operation at the same time. However, Herring calculated that the 7th Division had sufficient reserves at Nadzab to allow maintenance flights to be suspended for a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after the capture of Kaiapit. He planned to seize Kaiapit with an overland advance from Nadzab by independent companies, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, and the 7th Division's 21st Infantry Brigade.|$|E

25|$|Bread (Chleb) {{and bread}} rolls (Bułka) makes the Polish cuisine and {{tradition}} complete. It {{has been an}} essential part of them both for centuries. Today bread {{remains one of the most}} important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is rye or wheat, Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, is soft but not too soft inside, and has unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with sourdough which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> without getting too hard and is not crumbly when cut.|$|E

25|$|A <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later, {{the armed}} ship Caroline sent into Plymouth the Harmony, Poole, master, {{which had been}} sailing from Lisbon to Amsterdam. Then in late April, the armed brig Caroline and the {{privateer}} British Tar sent into Plymouth the Catherine and Elanor, of Bremen, which had been sailing from Nantz to Altoona. However, Catherine and Elanor was liberated and left Plymouth on 30 June for her original destination. At the end of November, Caroline sent into Plymouth the Danish vessel Elkin, Cornelius, master, which had been sailing from Havana to Tonningen.|$|E
25|$|When the George Washington {{was inaugurated}} as C's {{top-notch}} train on April 30, 1932, {{it was one}} of only two all-air-conditioned, long-distance trains operating in America. (the other was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Capitol Limited, which was instituted as an all-air-conditioned train only a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before the George Washington). New equipment was not built for this train; instead, older cars that were completely refurbished by Pullman and by C shops. It was still a few years before the streamliner craze, so C persisted with the standards of the time using its solid, heavy cars.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, and to stop a similar exodus of players as after the 2003 World Cup, the {{selected}} players were asked to sign a new contract. The players were summoned to meet Ozias Bvute, Zimbabwe Cricket's managing director, a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before they were due to set off and given an ultimatum– sign the contract on offer or be removed from the squad. It is understood that they were not allowed to take advice, and were told they had to make the decision there and then.|$|E

25|$|Methamphetamine induces a {{psychosis}} in 26–46 {{percent of}} heavy users. Some {{of these people}} develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those {{who have had a}} short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of going back onto methamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|After Cornell, Harris {{traveled}} back to Logan {{to become}} a professor of agronomy and an agronomist at Utah State Agricultural College. In 1920, Harris was working {{as director of the}} Utah State Agricultural Experiment Station and was also head of the department of zoology and Entomology at Utah State Agricultural College (USAC). Although he held these administrative positions at USAC and was already the president of the American Society of Agronomy, the General Church Board of Education offered Harris the opportunity to take George H. Brimhall's place as president of Brigham Young University. After thinking about his decision for a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> he accepted the offer on April 22, 1921. He was the first non-polygamous president of Brigham Young University.|$|E
25|$|After G. E. Moore {{resigned}} {{the chair}} in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet {{an official of the}} Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700kg of gold. There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher Sophia Janowskaya.|$|E

25|$|Goldfish, {{like all}} cyprinids, are egg-layers. They usually start {{breeding}} after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until {{then they are}} a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.|$|E

During this time No. 5 Commando was placed under the operational command of the 51st Indian Brigade and took part in a number of attacks around positions known as Milford and Pinner, before participating in the final stages of No. 1 Commando's defence of Hill 170, when two troops from the commando reinforced the defenders on 31 January and then took part in beating off the final attack on the following morning.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant females {{give birth}} soon after {{arriving}} on a rookery, and copulation generally occurs {{one to two}} weeks after giving birth, but the fertilized egg does not become implanted in the uterus until the fall. Twins are rare. After a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of nursing without leaving the rookery, females begin to take progressively longer and more frequent foraging trips, leaving their pups behind, until {{at some point in}} late summer the mother and pup both leave the rookery. Reproductive males fast throughout the reproductive season, often without entering the water once from mid-May until August, when the structure of the reproductive rookeries begins to fall apart and most animals leave for the open seas and disperse throughout their range.|$|E
