25|$|The {{supply and}} demand {{economic}} model suggests that any tax raises the cost of transaction for someone, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> seller or purchaser. In raising the cost, either the demand curve shifts leftward, or the supply curve shifts upward. The two are functionally equivalent. Consequently, the quantity of a good purchased decreases, and/or the price {{for which it is}} sold increases.|$|E

25|$|TeX is {{an example}} of a {{computer}} typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl.

25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the defect in the APC gene, and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> full or {{attenuated}} form, familial polyposis may manifest as polyps in colon or in the duodenal tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall was}} a {{temporary}} addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks {{the view of the}} rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now-empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kings—including Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin I of Jerusalem—and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th stations up on Calvary.|$|E
25|$|The {{name of the}} {{movement}} is {{the title of a}} painting that Kandinsky created in 1903, but it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> origin of the name of {{the movement}}, as Professor Klaus Lankheit learned that the title of the painting had been overwritten. Kandinsky wrote 20 years later that the name is derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of riders, combined with a shared love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art).|$|E

25|$|This {{difference}} {{is one of}} the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as Match.com, Yahoo Personals, and eHarmony.com are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like MySpace and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. <b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.|$|E
25|$|A Brahman {{who becomes}} a priest (pedanda) is {{entitled}} to a larger residence, called griya. Similarly, royal families are entitled a puri ("palace"). Both griya and puri consist of multiple courtyards instead of single courtyard. These multiple courtyards, similarly surrounded by pavilions, create its own subdivision within the extensive house compound. Each subdivision follows the same importance, and so the subdivision located in the kaja-kangin direction is always the most auspicious where {{the most important of}} the family shrines are usually located. In a royal palace, each courtyard compound corresponds to a specific use relating to royal duties. Despite the complexity of a griya or a puri, spatial orientation and hierarchical organization principle remains the same: the kaja-kangin is always the most auspicious corner. Principally, the consistent spatial orientation and hierarchy of Balinese traditional houses, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most lavish or the most humblest, are harmoniously linked with each other.|$|E
25|$|The 0001 Strat is a Fender Stratocaster {{electric}} guitar, {{with a white}} body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and {{an unusual}} gold colour scratch plate and hardware, owned by David Gilmour. He bought it from guitar technician Phil Taylor, who had purchased it from Seymour Duncan. This guitar {{is one of the}} most notable in his collection as it has the 0001 serial number. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 Strat Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Strats (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987-2004). It is not the first Fender Stratocaster ever made as prototypes had already been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and isn't clear <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real 0001 Strat because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the area}} is former shallow lake with {{remaining}} open water, wetlands and canals. Much of the surface water is saline due to the high mineral content of the soil and lack of natural outflow. The Lago de los Reyes Aztecas (Lake of the Aztec Kings) is a lake that covers 1.9 hectares and connects to the large network of canals and chinampas of the borough. It hosts about twenty five species of migratory birds including ducks and storks along with various fish, amphibians and reptiles. It {{is the most important}} tourist attraction of the borough with docks and trajinera boats. The main docks in Tlahuac do not have a large number of boats or restaurants as in Xochimilco. It is still possible to see small natural islands as well as natural vegetation in much {{of the area}} with chinampas still growing foodstuffs such as broccoli, chard, beets, chili peppers, peas, fava beans and corn. There are four main canals: Chalco, Guadalupano, Atecuyuac and Amecameca. The first two are important as sources of water for the chinampas of the borough and as a tourist attraction. There are also other smaller canals which serve as irrigation. On the border with the State of Mexico, there is an important ecological reserve lake area called the Cieniega de Tláhuac. There is also an artificial lake at the Bosque de Tláhuac. Los Humedales wetlands is an ecological reserve which covers between 400 and 800 hectares depending on <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rainy or dry season, a remnant of Lake Chalco. It {{is one of the few}} wetlands left in the Valley of Mexico and host a large number of migratory birds. It is also home to species called pocket gophers, skunks, squirrels, snakes and bats.|$|E

[...] McManus closed his argument for the relocation of Steamtown by pointing out, [...] "What is at stake is more than tourism and jobs.

500|$|Originally {{written as}} a {{potential}} series finale, the episode has received highly positive reception from television critics who often cited it as the best episode of the season. It has been particularly praised for its humor and for its emotional scenes, such as one where Bart and Lisa sit in their old treehouse {{and talk about how}} difficult parenting is. During the original broadcast, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was watched by about 6.43 million people. Since then, it has garnered attention in the media for a segment taking place thirty years in the future in which it is implied that the city of Dearborn, Michigan is [...] "still under sharia law". Commentators have had mixed opinions on what the segment is mocking, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> increasing Islamic influence in the US, specifically in [...] Dearborn, or rather those who are thinking that Dearborn is under sharia law in December 2011, the time that the episode aired.|$|E
