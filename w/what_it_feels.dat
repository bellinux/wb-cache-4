5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like {{to live in a world}} where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

Forget villain. Just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would <b>feel</b> like.

Songwriter Thom Yorke began recording The Eraser, his first solo release, with longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich in late 2004, and continued work throughout 2005 between Radiohead sessions.

500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns. [...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to launch the missiles. [...] We don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like when you're so into someone".|$|E

500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can only tell you <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like." ...|$|E

500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to believe that religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> {{like to be on}} a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
