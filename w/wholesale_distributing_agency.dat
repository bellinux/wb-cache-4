40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{contribute}} {{to the body of}} work on agency and institutional transmission by proposing two new concepts: <b>distributed</b> <b>agency</b> and dialogue. <b>Distributed</b> <b>agency</b> is a companion concept to that of ‘institutional entrepreneurship’. Whilst institutional entrepreneurship emphasizes the deliberate institution-building by a select few, <b>distributed</b> <b>agency</b> highlights the emergent institution-building that involves any and every organizational member. In turn, dialogue supplements the models of institutional diffusion by drawing attention to the situated interactions between the ‘champions’ and the ‘recipients’ of institutional innovations, to the frictions that accompany institutional transmission, and to the deviations that emerge from those interactions. We use these concepts to analyze the micro-discursive processes during a crucial event in the institutionalization of a new organizational template in a UK public–private partnership. We found that the implementation hinged upon enabling the audience (i. e. the employees expected to apply the template in their work) to act as agents (hence, <b>distributed</b> <b>agency)</b> by engaging in a dialogue that sought to define the audience's identity vis-à-vis coercive pressures, articulate and address its interests, and recognize its rights to modify the template to suit the local circumstances.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{statutory}} and administrative regulations {{by the federal}} and state governments and by water distributing organizations inhibit the formation of an unrestrained market for property rights in water in Arizona. This thesis was undertaken in order to examine the hypothesis that relaxing these restrictions would lead to increased economic efficiency in the use of water. In order to satisfy this objective, the relevant state and federal statutes and administrative regulations were reviewed, and a field survey of major irrigation <b>distributing</b> <b>agencies</b> was undertaken. The field survey, designed primarily to determine what regulations with respect to water transfer exist in irrigation water <b>distributing</b> <b>agencies,</b> permitted the collection of considerable other information concerning the organization and operation of these agencies. This additional information is also reported in the thesis. The conclusion from the analysis are that given the present ground water law, present cost of alternative supplies of ground water, and the physical cost of transferring water, the evidence does not indicate that any great increase in economic efficiency would follow from alternation of present procedures...|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{expanded}} view of making and, concomitantly, {{an understanding that}} through making we constitute {{the way we are}} in the world. The article begins with the idea that making produces a 'surrogate' of the body, which extends the body into the world, reforming the body and the world and their relationship. The ideas the article offers run counter to certain currents of thought that reduce making to a narrow cast anthropocentric crafting. Instead of this reduction, where making is merely understood and fixated as a close inembodied handicraft, the article advances: first, that all that we produce is making – not just that which is crafted by the immediacy of a hand; and, second, and linked to this expanded view of making, that all making workst hrough a <b>distributed</b> <b>agency</b> that includes human and non-human actors and actants in meshworks that extend across space – synchronous - and across time –diachronous. In other words, the body is extended into the world through what is made and this made world acts ineluctably on, and in, making. The paper references the practices of three makers {{to make the case for}} the need, bothethical and poetic, to think about making as an expanded term and to consideran intentionality of making that works through <b>distributed</b> <b>agency</b> doubly constituted as material and narrative...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergent}} {{literature on}} learning spaces {{in higher education}} articulates a desire to better engage academics and other stakeholders in the conceptualisation, design and development of university spaces. New processes that aim to support more participation in design are proposed. This chapter reviews a range of these processes using an activity-theoretical concept of <b>distributed</b> <b>agency.</b> Much of the examined literature proposes to intervene in estates life-cycles within particular, bounded activities. It is argued that forming long-term relations between university stakeholders, based on decentralised negotiation and peer review, would further expand the possibility of socially producing university learning spaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} policy {{implementation}} studies, which seek {{to explain how}} policies undergo some form of ‘translation’ from general policy guidelines to implementation in practice at the local level.

First, it draws {{on the concept of}} ‘local universality’ to suggest that the translation of policy by central actors is not simply transmitted but is iteratively transformed through multiple <b>distributed</b> <b>agencies</b> including local actors, infrastructure, data sets and organisational practices. Second, empirical findings show how structural policy design features influence implementation and (re) shape policy content by incorporating knowledge from practice. ...|$|R

We illustrate this new category of public innovation challenge with the (failed) case of the Swedish civil contingencies system and subsequently discuss {{a new line of}} inquiry for future research...|$|R
