500|$|Mars Attacks! drew mixed {{responses}} from critics. Based on 63 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of the reviewers enjoyed the film, {{with an average}} score of 5.9/10. By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 52/100 from 19 reviews. Roger Ebert observed the homages to the 1950s science fiction B movies. [...] "Ed Wood himself could have told us what's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> movie: the makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself. Look for Infra-Man (1975) or Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973) {{and you will find}} movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects but are funny and fun in a way that Burton's megaproduction never really understands." ...|$|E

Maybe Eleanor isn't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment." [...] Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, [...] "The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light – cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, [...] "There's nothing glaringly <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush and tidy.

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Crosetti and Lewis {{looking for clues}} in a dark alley. Levinson and Attanasio {{specifically}} wanted a dialogue-driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify {{the fact that the}} two men were detectives or what they were looking for. The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode, [...] "Forgive Us Our Trespasses", which aired on May 21, 1999. In that final scene, Detective Rene Sheppard (played by Michael Michele) says to Lewis, [...] "Life is a mystery, just accept it", a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Lewis also said, [...] "That's what's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> job. It ain't got nothin' to do do with life", a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Early scenes in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit.

500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

50|$|Another theme, brotherhood, is a {{positive}} feature of war. In feeling {{that they may not}} make it out alive, the soldiers develop strong friendships which are not relatable to people at home. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, “You’re all good guys. You’re all chicken, and you’re all yellow, but you’re good guys. They ain’t a goddam thing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> you.” <b>This</b> idea of brotherhood is again expressed within Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp.|$|R

Although their music may not be of the highest quality, those looking for lyrics that go deeper than your average contemporary worship band should consider giving {{at least some of}} Casting Crowns’ latest a listen." [...] Davies of Louder Than the Music gave it a three and a half out of five stars, noting that [...] "there is absolutely nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> album", which he expects more out of the band, advising that with [...] "a little bit more creativity musically and this could be a really strong album." [...] Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday gave it a four out of five stars, evoking how the album is [...] "filled with songs that both challenge and encourage believers in their walk", and calling it [...] "the best album by Casting Crowns since Lifesong". Bert Gangl of The Phantom Tollbooth gave it a three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album [...] "taken as a whole, the new record, in spite of its intermittent musical tangents – or perhaps because of them – winds up being one of the Crown collective's most cohesive, and impressive, releases to date." [...] Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com said the album was [...] "as strong and yet relatively safe as anything it has done before" [...] and praised it as [...] "sure to be among 2011’s most popular and enduring Christian albums". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel praised the album's songwriting and said the album [...] "is a solid effort in the Crowns discography". Barry Westman of Worship Leader praising the album for its [...] "variety in styles adds to the complexity of the album, and keeps the listener wondering what will come next." [...] At the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the album received the award for Top Christian Album.

In their book New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques, professors Hamido Fujita and Paul Johannesson argued that Madeline {{was a good}} role model for girls, due to her use of problem solving, critical thinking, and logic skills throughout the games to achieve her objectives. The Record said that her [...] "spirit and enthusiasm are well-suited to the coaching and teaching role" [...] she adopts throughout the series.

[...] Kawamoto thought Madeline was a [...] "feisty female lead", he felt the games had the potential to be [...] "equally enjoyable for boys and girls", but Abel noted in a separate article in the same magazine that the series is [...] "especially appealing to girls" [...] due to the choice of protagonist.

[...] However, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an autosave feature, the implementation of the Ring, which he felt was completely optional, and the combat system, which he called [...] "basic and repetitive." [...] He concluded [...] "what this game has that the EA game doesn't have - chapters, characters and events from the book - is important to a Tolkien fan, and it warrants playtime [...] but without this license, this game is very, very average."

[...] GameSpy's Bryan Stratton scored it 1.5 out of 5, comparing it unfavorably with the film; [...] "the reason that the movie worked was that Peter Jackson knew what to keep from the book, what to fast-forward through, and what to cut altogether.
