5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
5|$|The next {{assignment}} for 2e DB, {{and the one}} that it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops initially avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, General der Infanterie Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe de Gaulle, who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse Juin, Marie-Pierre Kœnig and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.|$|E
25|$|Having {{seen the}} disaster, Henry Charles ran to Rocky Point, {{where there was}} a {{telephone}} link to the quarantine station at William Head. The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, because they never knew when a ship might arrive.) <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E
6000|$|The {{vessel that}} {{picked them up}} was a {{coasting}} schooner bound {{to one of the}} Florida Keys, and she wouldn't put back with them, for she was under some sort of a contract, and kept right straight on her way. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> down <b>there,</b> <b>they</b> chartered a vessel which brought them up to Fernandina, where they took the steamer for Savannah. They were on the very steamer we passed in the inside passage. If we had only known that! ...|$|R
60|$|The entire {{dinner party}} on his right, {{the party of}} the ladies in {{advanced}} evening dress, looked at him.... He felt that everyone was watching him and making fun of him, and the injustice of this angered him. After all, they had every advantage he hadn't. And then, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> him <b>there</b> doing his best, what must they do but glance and sneer and nudge one another. He tried to catch them at it, and then took refuge in a second glass of wine.|$|R
60|$|The {{first five}} {{players on the}} list for the Grays were left-handed batters, and against a {{right-handed}} pitcher whose most effective ball for them was a high fast one over the outer corner they would naturally hit toward left field. It was no surprise to see Hanley bat a skyscraper out to left. Red had to run to get under it. He braced himself rather unusually for a fielder. He tried to catch the ball in his bare right hand and muffed it, Hanley got to second on the play while the audience roared. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> through <b>there</b> was some roaring among the Rochester players. Scott and Captain Healy roared at Red, and Red roared back at them.|$|R

2500|$|The initial {{group of}} four squadrons [...] (414th, 415th, 416th and 417th NFS) were the first {{graduates}} of the hastily organized training program at Orlando. [...] When deployed to England, they were sent with the P-70 night fighters they trained in, however, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> these squadrons were re-equipped with used Bristol Beaufighter Mk VIF radar-equipped nightfighters obtained from Britain under Reverse Lend-Lease. From there they were deployed to their combat assignments with Twelfth Air Force in North Africa to provide protection for the combat airfields in Algeria and Tunisia against Luftwaffe night attacks.|$|E

5000|$|She {{retired in}} 1961, aged only 54, {{not just from}} concert appearances, but from playing the violin at all. She {{preferred}} not even to teach. On one occasion, on holiday in Greece, she encountered Yehudi Menuhin on a beach, and she agreed to play some duets with him at his villa. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back <b>there,</b> he realised {{he did not have}} a spare violin, so that sole opportunity to play once more came to nothing. What could they have played? We are lucky to have Gioconda's recording back in 1955 of Viotti's Duo in G with Menuhin - a day earlier they also recorded Handel's Trio Sonata in g minor with John Shinebourne, cello and Raymond Leppard, harpsichord. Both recordings are to be found on Disc 41 of [...] "Menuhin - the Great EMI Recordings". 2 years earlier Menuhin, de Vito and Shinebourne teamed up with harpsichordist George Malcolm for Handel's Op.5/2 [...] "Sonata for 2 Violins and Continuo in D" [...] (Complete EMI Recordings, Korean issue from 2013), all these recordings were done in Abbey Road Studio No.3.|$|R
60|$|They went {{on talking}} volubly from that, {{and they talked}} {{as far away from}} what they were {{thinking}} about as possible. They talked of Europe, and Mrs. Pasmer said where they would live and what <b>they</b> would do <b>when</b> <b>they</b> all <b>got</b> back <b>there</b> together. Dan abetted her, and said that they must cross in June. Mrs. Pasmer said that she thought June was a good month. He asked if it were not the month of the marriages too, and she answered that he must ask Alice about that. Alice blushed and laughed her sweet reluctant laugh, and said she did not know; she had never been married.|$|R
6000|$|So she did this, and {{journeyed to}} the South Wind, neither was she very {{long on the}} way. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> had <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> the West Wind {{asked him if he}} could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon, for she was the girl who ought to marry the Prince who lived there. [...] "Oh, indeed!" [...] said the South Wind, [...] "is that she? Well," [...] said he, [...] "I have wandered about a great deal in my time, and in all kinds of places, but I have never blown so far as that. If you like, however, I will go with you to my brother, the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of all of us, and if he does not know where it is no one in the whole world will be able to tell you. You may sit upon my back, and then I will carry you there." [...] So she seated herself on his back, and off he went from his house in great haste, and they were not long on the way. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> came near the North Wind's dwelling, he was so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> [...] "What do you want?" [...] he roared out from afar, and they froze as they heard. Said the South Wind: [...] "It is I, and this is she who should have had the Prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon. And now she wishes to ask you if you have ever been there, and can tell her the way, for she would gladly find him again." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{they would}} go to Kent, and the first thing they would see in Kent, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> would be Henry and Anne fooling round Hever Castle.|$|E

60|$|We journeyed on again, and I welcomed {{every new}} {{assurance}} that France stood where I had left it. There were the posting-houses, with their archways, dirty stable-yards, and clean post-masters' wives, bright women of business, looking {{on at the}} putting-to of the horses; there were the postilions counting what money <b>they</b> <b>got,</b> into their hats, and never making enough of it; there were the standard population of grey horses of Flanders descent, invariably biting one another <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> a chance; <b>there</b> were the fleecy sheepskins, looped on over their uniforms by the postilions, like bibbed aprons when it blew and rained; there were their Jack-boots, and their cracking whips; there were the cathedrals that I got out to see, as under some cruel bondage, in no wise desiring to see them; there were the little towns that appeared to have no reason for being towns, since most of their houses were to let and nobody could be induced to look at them, except the people who couldn't let them and had {{nothing else to do}} but look at them all day. I lay a night upon the road and enjoyed delectable cookery of potatoes, and some other sensible things, adoption of which at home would inevitably be shown to be fraught with ruin, somehow or other, to that rickety national blessing, the British farmer; and at last I was rattled, like a single pill in a box, over leagues of stones, until--madly cracking, plunging, and flourishing two grey tails about--I made my triumphal entry into Paris.|$|R
