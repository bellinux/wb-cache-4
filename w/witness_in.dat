5|$|In 1933, Maxwell {{acted as}} a defence <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the trial of Alfred Jamieson, {{who was accused of}} housebreaking. Maxwell was Jamieson's former platoon {{commander}} and testified that Jamieson had been of good character but had been strongly affected by the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, {{he did not}} do so but Edward was called as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS {{cleared the}} Gypsy camp. A <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> {{another part of}} the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1959, Altgens made {{occasional}} appearances as {{an actor}} and model in motion pictures, television and print advertising. Credited as James Altgens, he played Secretary Lloyd Patterson in the low-budget science fiction thriller Beyond the Time Barrier (1960); his role included the film's final line of dialogue. Altgens' acting career also included a role as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> Free, White and 21 (1963), and as a witness (not as himself) in The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964).|$|E
5|$|Bokassa also {{hunted down}} Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died {{in prison in}} June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the {{exception}} of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until {{the downfall of the}} Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> Bokassa's criminal trials for treason, murder, cannibalism and embezzlement during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.|$|E

He also featured in Spooks and Silent <b>Witness.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, he landed his first main part in television as Stephen Hawking in Hawking.

5|$|In 1561, he {{finished}} his Historia General de las Indias and signed {{it over to the}} College of San Gregorio, stipulating that it could not be published until after forty years. In fact it was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly Sepúlveda, denounced him to the Spanish Inquisition, but nothing came from the case. Las Casas also appeared as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the case of the Inquisition against his friend Archbishop Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda, who had been falsely accused of heresy. In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense library to the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin and early years of Jakub Świnka, except for his mention in a {{document}} issued by Bolesław the Pious. As Archbishop of Gniezno, the cooperation between him and Przemysł II was excellent.

5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2013 a {{criminal}} case was opened against the band members {{who had participated in}} the Moscow cathedral performance on February 21. On March 3, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, two alleged members of Pussy Riot, were arrested by the Russian authorities and accused of hooliganism. Both women at first denied being members of the group and started a hunger strike in protest against being held in jail away from their young children. The defendants were held without bail. On March 16, another woman, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who had earlier been questioned as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the case, was similarly arrested and charged.|$|E

5|$|A defense-appointed expert <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> {{the field}} of {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, {{he could not have}} sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other witnesses in the upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> {{the course of the}} disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses {{in the absence of the}} other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police {{with a number of}} items across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional <b>witness.</b> <b>In</b> a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as a petty criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E
5|$|Under {{interrogation}} by MI5 officer William Skardon at {{an informal}} meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy {{and was not}} detained. In January 1950, Fuchs arranged another interview with Skardon and voluntarily confessed {{that he was a}} spy. Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States.|$|E
