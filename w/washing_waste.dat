During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of superstructure such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience, consequently, their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for <b>washing,</b> <b>waste</b> disposal, and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demand placed by the facility. Noise pollution has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and light pollution can disrupt the feeding and reproductive behaviour of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General waste and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates waste plastic and non-biodegradable products.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential use of sand <b>washing</b> <b>waste</b> as filler for epoxy resin mortar. The mechanical properties of four series of mortars containing epoxy binder at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt. % mixed with sand blended with sand <b>washing</b> <b>waste</b> filler in the range of 0 – 20 wt. % were examined. The compressive and flexural strength increased with the increase in epoxy and filler content; however, above epoxy 20 wt. %, slight change was seen in strength due to increase in epoxy and filler content. Modulus of elasticity also linearly increased with the increase in filler content, but the use of epoxy content beyond 20 wt. % decreased the modulus of elasticity of the mortar. For epoxy content at 10 wt. %, poor bond strength lower than 0. 8 MPa was observed, and adding filler at 20 wt. % adversely affected the bond strength, in contrast to the mortars containing epoxy at 15, 20, 25 wt. %. The results indicate that the sand <b>washing</b> <b>waste</b> can be used as potential filler for epoxy resin mortar to obtain better mechanical properties by adding the optimum level of sand <b>washing</b> <b>waste</b> filler...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Mining in general, {{and open}} cut mining in particular, is an {{inherently}} destructive process. Mining occupies {{a very small}} area of the Australian continent, but causes intense disruption to the environment when concentrated in relatively small regions where minerals outcrop, or {{are close to the}} surface. In the upper Hunter River Valley region of New South Wales, open cut coal mining currently directly covers 500 km² or 1 / 6 of the upper valley. Revegetation strategies have moved from rehabilitation to past land use, usually grazing in the Hunter Valley, to reconstruction of native ecosystems, whether wooded or native grasslands. At the Mount Owen mine, mining consent requires reconstruction of approximately 220 ha of the Ravensworth State Forest, a dry sclerophyll forest ecosystem dominated by trees from the genus Eucalyptus. Additionally the mine owner and operator have decided to revegetate to forest or woodland the entire disturbance area of about 960 ha. Topsoil transfer is the usual method of re-establishing native vegetation, but forest topsoil supply is inadequate to fulfil the stated goals. Spoil, the crushed rock from just below the soil horizons down to, and between, the coal seams, is not a medium conducive to plant growth. It is biologically dead, deficient in nitrogen and other plant available nutrients and not having been subjected to soil building processes, lacks any structure. To support a native forest ecosystem, with all its constituent vegetation layers, spoil needs to be physically amended with soil replacement media, preferably forest topsoil, but other materials such as pasture subsoil, chitter (coal <b>washing</b> <b>waste)</b> and, or biosolids (dried sewerage sludge). Nutrients added as fertilizers have been the traditional method of overcoming soil nutrient deficiencies. But this is an expensive, inefficient practice that can result in pollution from leaching and runoff. One method {{that can be used to}} circumvent these problems is the addition of soil microbes that mediate the input of plant available nutrients from the soil medium. As nitrogen has been identified as being particularly deficient in this system, the re-introduction of native legumes with their rhizobial symbionts was seen as a sustainable method of supplying nitrogen to the reconstructed forest ecosystem. To this end, root nodules from native legumes growing in the Ravensworth State Forest, Mount Owen mine rehabilitation areas and Donaldson mine, further down the valley, were collected, sterilized and cultured. Thirty-four bacterial cultures were subjected to culture-dependent and molecular identification. Twenty-three isolates were confirmed as nodulators by their ability to re-nodulate Macroptilium atropurpureum. Using PCR and targeting a 500 bp fragment of the 16 s rRNA gene seven members of the genus Rhizobium were identified, including three of the same strain, and two from the genus Agrobacterium. Seven isolates were identified as not having been previously described. Three of these exhibited high homology to the genus Pseudomonas and four were identified from the genus Burkholderia. The isolate that was chosen for pot trials and the field inoculum was later identified as belonging to the genus Burkholderia, which at the time of identification had not been previously reported in Australia. These nodulating cultures were inoculated onto seedlings of six legumes that were to be used in the revegetation efforts at Mount Owen mine and tested for specificity and effectiveness in promoting growth in a series of controlled environment trials. The legume species included the dominant middle storey small tree, Acacia parvipinnula, four shrubs, Indigofera australis, Daviesia ulicifolia, Acacia amblygona, Pultenaea retusa, and a creeper or twiner, Hardenbergia violacea. Specificity was determined by the ability to nodulate, with functional nodules scored by observation of a rust red colour indicating the presence of leghaemoglobin. Effectiveness of growth promotion was determined by shoot dry weight and its ratio with nodule dry weight. Results showed marked variation in host-symbiont specificity and significant differences in the ability to promote growth of the legume hosts. A. parvipinnula proved to be the least specific host (nodulated by 22 / 23), while D. ulicifolia (nodulated by 13 / 23) and P. retusa (nodulated by 8 / 23) were the most specific. Bacteria also displayed specificity with six isolates able to form functional nodules on all six hosts. The remaining isolates were either unable to nodulate all of the hosts or formed non-functional nodules. No single isolate proved to be a highly effective growth promoter on all host legumes. For reasons of expediency in progressing the project, the first isolate that formed functional nodules on all hosts was chosen as the field trial inoculum. The ability of the selected inoculating isolate to promote the growth of a simulated community of plants, including the six test legumes used for specificity testing, found in the Ravensworth State Forest when grown in a range of soil replacement media was then tested in shade house and field trials. The shade house trial demonstrated the ability of the inoculum to successfully increase the growth of the plant community, including in media with a resident rhizobia population, one potential obstacle to successful inoculum establishment. Under field conditions at the Mount Owen mine, inoculation of the six host legumes with the selected isolate successfully increased survival and dry weight of five of the species, albeit with some interaction between host legumes and soil replacement media. In conclusion, a number of new soil dwelling bacteria have been cultured and warrant further investigation, including a novel strain of nodulating Burkholderia. It was demonstrated that specificity exits between the native legumes and nodulating symbionts tested, with significant differences in ability to nodulate and promote plant growth. Further testing of specificity for other commonly found legumes is warranted. Investigation of the efficacy of multi-isolate inocula versus single isolate inoculum trialled here to increase effectiveness and to facilitate the re-introduction of native nodulators is also suggested. Successful inoculation was shown to enhance revegetation efforts by increasing survival and plant growth in a range of soil replacement media...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} ignition {{of organic}} liquids {{stored in the}} Hanford Site high-level radioactive waste tanks {{has been identified as}} a safety issue because expanding gases could potentially affect tank dome integrity. Organic liquid waste has been found in some of the waste tanks, but most are thought to contain only trace amounts. Due to the inhomogeneity of the waste, direct sampling of the tank waste to locate organic liquids may not conclusively demonstrate that a given tank is free of risk. However, organic vapors present above the organic liquid waste can be detected {{with a high degree of}} confidence and can be used to identify problem tanks. This report presents the results of a screening test that has been applied to 82 passively ventilated high-level radioactive waste tanks at the Hanford Site to identify those that might contain a significant amount of organic liquid waste. It includes seven tanks not addressed in the previous version of this report, Screening for Organic Solvents in Hanford Waste Tanks Using Total Non-Methane Organic Compound Vapor Concentrations. The screening test is based on a simple model of the tank headspace that estimates the effective surface area of semivolatile organic liquid waste in a tank. Analyses indicate that damage to the tank dome is credible only if the organic liquid burn rate is above a threshold value, and this can occur only if the surface area of organic liquid in a tank is above a corresponding threshold value of about one square meter. Thirteen tanks were identified as potentially containing at least that amount of semivolatile organic liquid based on conservative estimates. Most of the tanks identified as containing potentially significant quantities of organic liquid waste are in the 241 -BY and 241 -C tank farms, which agrees qualitatively with the fact that these tank farms received the majority of the PUREX process organic <b>wash</b> <b>waste</b> and waste organic liquids...|$|R
40|$|The 241 -A- 101 tank, a 22. 9 meter 3, 785, 400 liter {{capacity}} SST, {{was constructed}} {{from the fourth}} generation of tank designs, which were capable of holding boiling or self-concentrating waste. Construction features a reinforced concrete shell, dome, and base with a mild steel liner covering the bottom and sidewalls. The tank has a flat bottom with a usable waste depth of approximately 9. 4 meters. The tank was put into service in 1956 to store plutonium-uranium extraction (PUREX) high-level <b>waste</b> and organic <b>wash</b> <b>waste.</b> The waste was allowed to self-concentrate up until 1968. Tank sluicing was performed in 1969 and again in 1976 {{to reduce the amount}} of strontium and cesium, the two isotopes found to be the main heat generating sources in the tank. In 1978, the tank was reassigned for saltcake storage. The tank was taken out of service in November 1980 and partially isolated in 1982. Salt well pumping is a method used to interim stabilize SSTS. Interim stabilization is commenced once all the liquid above the solids has been removed (primary stabilization). Interim stabilization removes the gravity drainable liquid and the interstitial liquid between the solids from the SST and transfers the liquid to a double-shell tank (DST) or to a staging double-contained receiver tank (DCRT), which is subsequently transferred to a DST. Pumping is accomplished at very low flow rates, 15. 1 liters per minute or less. Normally, salt well pumping is performed without the need of an exhauster. However, recent safety evaluations concluded that a minimum exhaust flow rate of 7. 1 cubic meters per minute would be required to enhance the safety of the tank. Therefore, active ventilation will be part of this process for the 241 -A- 101 tank. This document details the Nonradioactive Air Emissions Notice of Construction for the use of a portable exhauster on Tank 241 -A- 101 during salt well pumping and other routine activities...|$|R
60|$|The hogs (and {{that would}} be sufficient) which were fed with the <b>waste</b> <b>wash</b> of that produce did not demand the fourth part of the corn used by farmers in {{fattening}} them. The spirit was nearly so much clear gain to the nation. It is an odd way of making flesh cheap, to stop or check the distillery.|$|R
50|$|Fibre is {{extracted}} {{by a process}} known as decortication, where leaves are crushed, beaten, and brushed away by a rotating wheel set with blunt knives, so that only fibres remain. Alternatively, in East Africa, where production is typically on large estates, the leaves are transported to a central decortication plant, where water is used to <b>wash</b> away the <b>waste</b> parts of the leaf.|$|R
5000|$|A new Sanitary Demonstration Area was {{constructed}} at the Presidio of Monterey, at first by officer trainees, and later be enlisted men and prisoners of war. This area contained about forty appliances, and was completely constructed from salvage material, except for cement, with about 1500 man hours of labor. A practice construction area ordered the permanent installations. During training {{a number of}} these appliances were in operation. To inaugurate the Area, all of the Headquarters Staff was conducted on a tour in late May. Food was prepared on the field ranges and the noon meal was served in the field, mess gear was <b>washed</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal carried out in the field incinerators.|$|R
