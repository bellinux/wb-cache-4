25|$|Leggett's own {{research}} interests {{shifted away from}} superfluid 3He since around 1980; he worked inter alia on the low-temperature properties of glasses, high-temperature superconductivity, the Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) atomic gases and above all on the theory of experiments to test whether the formation of quantum mechanics will continue to describe the physical world as <b>we</b> <b>push</b> it up from the atomic level towards that of everyday life.|$|E
25|$|If v1 is not {{adjacent}} to v3, we can merge these two vertices {{into a single}} vertex. To do this, we remove v from both circular adjacency lists, and then splice the two lists together into one list {{at the point where}} v was formerly found. Provided that v maintains a reference to its position in each list, this can be done in constant time. It's possible that this might create faces bounded by two edges at the two points where the lists are spliced together; we delete one edge from any such faces. After doing this, <b>we</b> <b>push</b> v3 onto Sd, along with a note that v1 is the vertex that it was merged with. Any vertices affected by the merge are added or removed from the stacks as appropriate.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Allied invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in Northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields {{extended}} inland along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for gliders and parachutists, the Germans emplanted slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called Rommelspargel ("Rommel's Asparagus"). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were intentionally flooded. Rommel believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped on the beach, declaring, [...] "It is absolutely necessary that <b>we</b> <b>push</b> the British and Americans back from the beaches. Afterwards it will be too late; the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive." ...|$|E
60|$|Taking a {{leg each}} <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> him through. <b>We</b> heard him plump into the sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>pushed</b> on, and in {{the beauty}} of the walk forgot our indignation. My {{estimate}} proved to be correct.|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{throwing}} our rifles into {{a position}} of readiness <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> rapidly through the underwood in the direction whence the cry had come.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{expressed concern}} about Semenya's testosterone levels, following her win. Eric Vilain, a medical geneticist, said in an interview, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>push</b> this argument, anyone declaring a female gender can compete as a woman... We’re moving toward one big competition, and the very predictable result of that competition {{is that there will}} be no women winners." [...] Other commentators, such as bioethicist Katrina Karkazis, point to statements by losing competitors as evidence of discriminatory treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The negotiations, {{which at}} times became {{extremely}} technical (Kissinger, for instance, noted a lengthy {{discussion of the}} implications of enlarging missile silos by 15%), slowed down as more contentious topics came up. The first of these involved the United States, including its Forward Base System with F-4, F-111, and FB-111 fighters, its nuclear weapons deployed in Western Europe, its production of Trident-equipped Ohio-class submarines, and its plans to build the B-1 bomber. While the Soviet Union was concerned by all of these American weapons, the United States was able to negotiate from a position of strength and preserved all of these advantages: regarding the submarines and the B-1, Ford successfully convinced his Soviet counterparts that his country's [...] "national security...demanded that <b>we</b> <b>push</b> forward with both." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo {{commented on}} the rivalry by saying: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>push</b> each other {{sometimes}} in the competition, {{this is why the}} competition is so high", while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson opined that [...] "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best". Messi has denied any rivalry, saying that it was [...] "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano". In response to claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: [...] "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't {{with a lot of other}} players", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: [...] "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Ishmael, <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> {{the matter}} far. Had little been said, {{who would have}} been the wiser? Our consciences might then have been quiet." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sean Garrett {{confirmed}} in July 2012 {{that he had}} been in the studio with French DJ David Guetta working on Rihanna's album saying [...] "I was in the studio with David doing some stuff for Rihanna recently. He finds inspiration in the things I don't like, and I get excited by the things he doesn't like. He wants to be more urban and I want to be more international, so <b>we</b> <b>push</b> each other, I try to help Rihanna. She works hard and it's cool to write for someone who is so open-minded." [...] On August 21, American songwriter Claude Kelly revealed {{that he had been}} writing songs for Rihanna while she was performing in London. Kelly spoke on the songs that he had written for Rihanna saying; [...] "Rihanna's a worldwide superstar at this point and she's performing in stadiums and arenas now, so I wanted songs that reflected her audience, when I was in London she was performing at a festival in front of like 30,000 to 40,000 people. So I didn't want small songs that only worked on radio, so I tried to do anthemic big stadium-themed songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, Guillermo del Toro {{signed on}} as {{executive}} producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested <b>we</b> <b>push</b> that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E

[...] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players face each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which had a global audience of 400million viewers in March 2014.|$|E
60|$|Straightening his back, Mr. Saxton saw us, {{and called}} to us to come and help. <b>We</b> <b>pushed</b> through {{a gap in the}} hedge and went up to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>pushed</b> off in silence. The car weighed 1,200 lb., {{and even}} on ball-bearings was a {{powerful}} sudorific. From somewhere behind a hedge we heard a gross rustic laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Champigny was taken. They {{say that}} there was a hard fight there and <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> the Prussians back beyond it ever so far," [...] and Madame Michaud's arms {{expressed}} illimitable distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, {{dropping}} lightly {{from his}} perch, [...] "these natives {{may have been}} searching for us all night, and are perhaps nearer than we suppose. I vote that <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity you didn't {{find the}} rest of the letter," [...] {{observed}} Noel Urner. [...] "No doubt that letter was of great importance. It might be best to hunt up this Captain Grady and learn the truth from him before <b>we</b> <b>push</b> further for the railroad station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Howel ap Ryddyn. You passed my abode, which {{cannot be}} seen from the road; and I would, were you not pressed for time, gladly {{entertain}} you; but if <b>we</b> <b>push</b> forward, we may reach Aberystwith before nightfall, and I make no question that would better suit your wishes." ...|$|E
60|$|I was on {{the slope}} above the bushes; Montgomery and Moreau beat along the beach beneath. Slowly <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> in among the fretted network of {{branches}} and leaves. The quarry was silent.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>pushed</b> {{off into}} the darkness, our light craft moved quickly away by the rapid current, and almost {{immediately}} {{it seemed as if}} we were wholly alone in the wilderness once more.|$|R
60|$|It was night, however, {{before we}} came upon further traces of them,-- several fires where they had stopped to cook some food. As the sky was clear, <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> on all that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course; {{how stupid}} of {{me not to}} see that before! Let's go at once!" [...] cried Tom, {{starting}} up in excitement. [...] "Undoubtedly he meant that. He must have overheard the villains talk of going there, and {{we may not be}} in time to aid them unless <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What think you, Bunco," [...] said Will Osten, {{turning to}} his dark-skinned companion, [...] "shall we encamp on this arid {{part of the}} plain and go {{waterless}} as well as supperless to rest, or shall <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on? I fear the horses will break down {{if we try to}} force them much further." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have got}} but a short start of us," [...] said Karlsefin, looking thoughtfully into the fire, before which he {{reclined}} {{on a couch}} of pine-branches, [...] "and if <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on with vigour, giving ourselves only just sufficient repose to keep up our strength, we shall be sure to overtake them {{in a day or}} two." ...|$|E
60|$|After this <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> {{forward at}} a leisurely pace, and in {{comparative}} security, until {{we arrived at}} Corn Island, where my mother greeted Paul and me {{as if we were}} come from the dead.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> {{from the}} strand; Borabolla waving his adieus {{with a green}} leaf of banana; our comrade ruefully eyeing the {{receding}} canoes; and the multitude loudly invoking for us a prosperous voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not. It {{was a long}} journey, but it was {{fortunate}} that <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> on as <b>we</b> did; for had we been twelve hours later, {{we should not have}} found the queen at Nerac." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The moment <b>we</b> <b>push</b> off, {{get your}} head sails aback {{and put her}} on the wind so as to get out of our way. I shall fill her off on the other tack and then come round and join you. We will keep {{together}} until we see whether she means to fight or run. Remember, the great thing is to knock a spar out of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall go quick, Mak. But {{in order}} to do that, we must eat well, and sleep at least an hour or so. If <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on just now, after a hard day's journey, without food or rest, we shall make but slow progress; and even if we did come up with the slave-dealer, we should not be in a very fit state for a battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go with you," [...] said Warder. [...] "It's madness to stop here. Death {{will be at}} our elbow anyhow, but he'll be sure {{to strike}} us all if we remain where we are. The meat we were {{lucky enough to get}} {{yesterday}} will keep our party on short allowance for some time, and the men will surely find something or other to eke it out while <b>we</b> <b>push</b> on and bring relief." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently as with Rosinante's nose at my {{shoulder}} <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> slowly forward, a nightingale burst close against my ear into so passionate a descant I thought I should be gooseflesh {{to the end}} of my days.|$|R
6000|$|... "What of that, sir! we obeyed orders. 'Avenge his death!' was the cry; and on <b>we</b> <b>pushed,</b> in obedience, {{until there}} were not men enough left in our {{battalion}} to carry the wounded to the rear." ...|$|R
6000|$|Stannard hesitated and knitted his brows. [...] "I think we'll risk {{it in the}} morning. You see, if <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> {{along the}} range, we might meet the police. Besides, we must {{get down to the}} timber soon." ...|$|R
