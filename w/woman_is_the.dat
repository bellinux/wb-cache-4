5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class. In an ironic twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> murderer and the man is the instigator. Leskov's novel {{was the basis for}} Dmitri Shostakovich's 1936 opera of the same name.|$|E

The Wrongs of Woman was published posthumously in 1798 by her husband, William Godwin, {{and is often}} considered her most radical feminist work.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a <b>Woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer.

Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E

5|$|L.A. <b>Woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sixth studio album by the American {{rock band}} the Doors, {{released}} on April 19, 1971, on Elektra Records. It {{is the last}} to feature the group's lead singer, Jim Morrison, who died {{three months after the}} album's release. It saw the band continue to integrate elements of blues back into their music, a direction begun with their previous album, Morrison Hotel. It was also recorded without record producer Paul A. Rothchild after he fell out with the group over the perceived lack of quality of their studio performances. Subsequently, the band co-produced the album with longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not <b>be</b> underestimated. Many <b>women</b> perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most anxious, Asian <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most stoic.|$|R

5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{turns to}} the topic of love, which, he says, is in the realm of women. Women {{naturally}} have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire of women is against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient Sparta, where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one who is most social, most talked about, judgmental and authoritative.|$|E
25|$|There is a Noh play by {{the name}} of Kurozuka that tells the story of two priests who stop by the hut of the Onibaba in Adachi.

Later, she leaves to gather firewood, but tells the priests not to look into the inner room of the house. Curious, the servant disobeys and the priests find that the inner room is filled with the bones and rotting corpses of people. They realize that the <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> goblin of Adachi. As they are about to run away, the Onibaba returned, outraged, and in her demon form.

25|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{is caused}} by influenza A subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N3, H3N1, and H3N2. In pigs, four influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and H7N9) {{are the most common}} strains worldwide. In the United States, the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998; however, since late August 1998, H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs. As of 2004, H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants, containing genes from human (HA, NA, and PB1), swine (NS, NP, and M), and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages. In August 2012, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 145 human cases (113 in Indiana, 30 in Ohio, one in Hawaii and one in Illinois) of H3N2v since July 2012.
