The corpus under scrutiny is the closing speech of the public prosecutor in a Belgian Assize court trial and its simultaneous <b>whispered</b> <b>interpretation</b> addressed to the defendant. According to Aristotle, the speaker can appeal to three means of proof to make his speech persuasive: an appeal to ethos aims at enhancing his credibility with the audience, an appeal to pathos aims at arousing emotions, while an appeal to logos aims at convincing {{by the use of}} reasoning and arguments. The analysis of the prosecutorâ€™s closing speech focuses only on pathos. For ethical reasons, Aristotle condemned this means of persuasion. He nevertheless recognized its ubiquity and efficacy in such real-life situations. The analysis of the interpreted speech reveals numerous shifts that alter the strategic persuasiveness of the source speech. A number of methodological considerations have emerged from this empirical case study: firstly, classical rhetoric offers a valid theoretical framework for appreciating the persuasive effect of a great range of discourse features and secondly, {{it is for this reason}} an excellent instrument for analyzing the interpretation of persuasive monologues. status: publishe...|$|E

Since time immemorial, <b>whispering</b> simultaneous <b>interpretation</b> has been used, known in the trade by the French term [...] "chucotage".Whispered simultaneous [...] To avoid disturbing the original speaker and those present listening to the original speaker, the interpreter's voice is kept at a low volume. To do this, the interpreter and the person requiring interpretion must sit or stand in close proximity to one another. No actual whispering is involved as this is difficult to decipher as well as being too much of a strain on the voice: the interpreter uses normal 'voiced' speech at a low volume. Only one or at the most two people in need of interpretation can be accommodated, unless portable electronic equipment is used.|$|R
