5|$|The Shia {{majority}} {{ruled by}} the Sunni Al khalifa family since the eighteenth century have long complained of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> systemic discrimination. They are blocked from serving in important political and military posts {{and the government has}} reportedly naturalized Sunnis originally from Pakistan and Syria in what Shia say is an attempt to increase the percentage of Sunnis in the population.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{small group of}} congregations split away in 1987 to form the Alliance of Baptists. With more than 2,000 individual members in 2010, 32 domestic and international mission partners, and 130 affiliate congregations the Alliance is an organization of Baptists promoting <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> progressive theologies, radical inclusivity, justice-seeking, ecumenism, and mission partnerships around the world.|$|E
25|$|There are Protestants, {{especially}} of the Reformed tradition, that either reject or down-play the designation Protestant because of the negative idea that the word invokes {{in addition to its}} primary meaning, preferring the designation Reformed, Evangelical or even Reformed Catholic expressive of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a Reformed Catholicity and defending their arguments from the traditional Protestant confessions.|$|E

25|$|High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton {{stressed}} the need to “hand over any unauthorised arms to the authorities immediately,” {{in the wake of}} a protest on 26 March at the parliament building, to pressure lawmakers to sack the newly appointed Interior Minister Arsen Avakov because the Right Sector group believes that Avakov is personally responsible for ordering <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a political assassination of one of their leader, Aleksandr Muzychko, who was killed in a special operation in a city of Rovno the previous evening.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the great}} Kilkenny {{team of the}} 1970s break up as Offaly GAA emerged as a new force in Leinster. ‘The Cats’ fought back in 1982 by {{capturing}} the National League and the Leinster title. Christy Heffernan’s two goals in a forty-minute spell gave Kilkenny a victory over Cork GAA in the subsequent All-Ireland final. In 1983 Kilkenny completed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> ‘the double-double’ as they captured back-to-back League, Leinster and All-Ireland honours. Cork were defeated {{once again in the}} championship decider. Kilkenny’s hopes of capturing the three-in-a-row were dashed in the provincial championship of 1984.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who agree}} with the CPC point towards <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> rapid {{deterioration}} in Western societies, claiming {{that there has been}} an increase in geographic, religious and racial segregation, rising crime rates, family breakdown, industrial action, vandalism, and political extremism within Western societies. The European Union and the United Nations claim to be stopping these types of human rights violations, save for a few violations committed by some western governments (e.g. the CIA's extraordinary rendition programme). The PRC holds the opinion, though, that many alleged negatives about democratic society are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that too much freedom is dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The Alutiiq {{language}} is relatively {{close to that}} spoken by the Yupik in the Bethel, Alaska area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the Alaska Peninsula and on Kodiak Island, and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern Kenai Peninsula and in Prince William Sound. Residents of Nanwalek, located on {{southern part of the}} Kenai Peninsula near Seldovia, speak <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.|$|E
25|$|Because Connecticut was {{believed}} to be a Democratic stronghold, Connecticut's Senate seat was considered safe to remain as a Democratic seat by political analysts, but Lieberman's continued support for conservative and Bush administration policies made him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenger. Lieberman's critics objected to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> Lieberman's lack of commitment to the Democratic party; his opposition to affirmative action; his opposition to a Connecticut state law that would require Catholic hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims; his membership in the bipartisan Gang of 14; his support of Florida governor Jeb Bush in the Terri Schiavo case; his initial willingness to compromise on Social Security privatization; his alliances with Republicans; and his attacks on other Democrats.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Cody guided Kilkenny to {{a second}} {{consecutive}} Leinster title and a second consecutive All-Ireland final appearance. Cork GAA provided the opposition on that occasion. However, in atrocious weather conditions, Kilkenny were denied once again. In 2000 Kilkenny eased to another Leinster title and a third successive All-Ireland final. The prospect of becoming the first side in history to lose three successive championship deciders was a huge motivating factor. In the end Kilkenny trounced Offaly to take the title. Another Leinster title {{was added to the}} collection in 2001 before ‘the Cats’ annexed a National Hurling League title in 2002. As Kilkenny began to assert their dominance on the hurling world the team later captured another set of Leinster and All-Ireland titles. In 2003 Kilkenny completed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> ‘the double-double’ as they captured back-to-back League, Leinster and All-Ireland honours.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E

500|$|Some autistic {{people have}} {{advocated}} {{a shift in}} perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex syndromes rather than diseases that must be cured.

These views are the basis for the autistic rights and autistic pride movements. There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically {{do not want to be}} cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.|$|E
500|$|To draw Lisa's {{head and}} hair, {{most of the}} show's animators use <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> the [...] "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) {{intersecting}} in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards {{the back of her}} head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it. Several Simpsons animators, including Pete Michels and David Silverman, consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw. Silverman explains that [...] "her head is so abstract" [...] due to her hairstyle.|$|E
