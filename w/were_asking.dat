5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} annexation for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld {{as evidence of the}} strong resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to annexation. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for the restoration of the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Krichell went to Hartford, Connecticut to sign shortstop Leo Durocher for a $7,500 bonus ($ in 2010). When {{the deal}} was concluded, Barrow sent Krichell to Salt Lake City to watch young second baseman Tony Lazzeri, who played for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League and hit 60 home runs and {{achieved}} over 200 RBIs the previous season. The Bees <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for $50,000 ($ in 2010), but several scouts placed his value ten times lower. The Chicago Cubs were given the option to sign him for a discounted rate, but declined because he had epilepsy. Krichell saw promise in the player and convinced Barrow to buy him. Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop Mark Koenig from the Minneapolis Millers. These Krichell signings formed part of the 1927 New York Yankees team, {{considered by many to}} be the greatest team ever assembled. Four of the starters in this squad were signed by Krichell, including three-quarters of its infield and Mike Gazella, its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 ($ in 2010). The Yankees took just four games to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates and win the 1927 World Series.|$|E

25|$|The Second Scheme was {{received}} extremely poorly, and {{as early as}} mid-1978, the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> publishers of textbooks, newspapers and other works to stop using the second-round simplifications.

25|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw the {{founding}} {{of a large number}} of new schools in Britain, especially by the churches—including the Methodist church.

The Methodist Conference set up a committee to look at the possibility of starting a new school at either Oxford or Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{project had}} been {{proposed}} {{in part to}} stave off blight and economic downturn in the area due to the 1970s fiscal crisis, which had led city officials {{to try to prevent}} Fordham University from relocating out of the borough and into Westchester County, in addition to declare Fordham Road the northern boundary of the South Bronx to reduce the stigma of Fordham being associated with the rundown South Bronx. While construction was planned to be completed by mid-1977, it was delayed by negotiations with the Postal Service (who <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> $8 million for the sale of the site after paying $1.8 million a decade earlier), and ultimately stopped in 1981 when the application for federal funds for the project was frozen.|$|E
25|$|Chuck Surack {{established}} {{the company in}} 1979 in Fort Wayne, Indiana {{so that he could}} stop being a touring musician. The company originally offered recording services via a remote recording studio in Surack's Volkswagen microbus and a recording studio based out of his home. When the Kurzweil K250 programmable keyboard and sampler was introduced in 1984, Surack became known for his custom K250 sound library and programming skills as well as his upgrade kits. Surack became a Kurzweil dealer, but his clients <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for advice regarding other products as well. Surack expanded Sweetwater to become a music retailer whose emphasis was pre- and post-sale customer service. By 1990, with 6 employees and annual sales of $6 million, Sweetwater had outgrown Surack's home and moved into its own commercial building.|$|E

25|$|These {{performances}} {{caught the}} attention of Harry Jenkins, the Tasmanian-based recruiting scout for Richmond. Acting on Jenkins' recommendation, club secretary Graeme Richmond flew to the island state to watch Hart in action, but he missed seeing Hart play. Nevertheless, Richmond was prepared to sign Hart sight unseen. Hart's mother warned that he would need suitable clothing to wear to work, which he didn't have. Richmond countered by offering the youngster a suit and six shirts, then posted papers to the Hart household, which were readily signed. At a time when untried players <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> VFL clubs for large signing on fees, Richmond knew he had a bargain. Aged 17, Hart crossed Bass Strait determined to develop his precocious talent, which was unusual; most Tasmania players played a number of seasons in the local competition before crossing to Victoria as mature age recruits.|$|E
25|$|Protests held by Cham {{organizations}} were ignored in Albania by both major parties, both the Democratic and the Socialist party. This {{is seen by}} some analysts {{as an attempt to}} strengthen the negotiating power of the Albanian government by non-raising the Cham Issue, while it could legitimately claim that it was obliged to raise the Cham question because of such strong pressure from the Cham community. The major Cham march of 2006, also strengthened the position of the Albanian government because it provided additional arguments in the controversy over the graves of Greek soldiers on Albanian territory. The Albanian government used as a justification the fact that Greece did not allow Chams to pay homage at the graves of their forefathers, while they <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> to build several cemeteries for its soldiers killed in Albania during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed {{that he had been}} eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E
