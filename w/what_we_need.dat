It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.'

500|$|The Times-Picayune writer Benjamin Morrison {{praised the}} [...] "unexpectedly understated" [...] {{performance}} of Williams and praised the episode {{for not being}} simple or formulaic.

He said Williams [...] "astonishes in every scene", and praised the script for not racing over topics as many television shows do, but rather taking [...] "full measure {{of the weight of}} grief". Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, described Williams' performance as [...] "heartbreaking", but particularly praised the writers for [...] "taking the show to a higher level" [...] by making the perpetrator sympathetic and three-dimensional, not only the victim. Liner said, [...] "Fontana succeeds in fleshing out the characters {{on both sides of this}} tragedy." [...] Bob Langford of The News & Observer called the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] and praised it for focusing not on the crime but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic portrayals regarding race, such as concerns the crime would keep away white tourists.

The performance of Andre Braugher was also particularly praised, especially for his scene in [...] "Black and Blue", in which Pembleton persuades a suspect to confess to a murder he did not commit. Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the second season was an improvement over the first, which she said was excellent but [...] "tended to demand an awful lot from viewers". Pennington said the toned down visual style and stronger emphasis on single stories better focused the show, adding: [...] "Homicide is great TV, and NBC believes in it enough to give it what may be the network's best time slot." [...] Bob Langford of The News & Observer called Homicide [...] "absolutely brilliant" [...] and praised it for focusing not on the crimes but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic themes regarding race, such as concerns in [...] "Bop Gun" [...] that the murder would deter white tourists from visiting Baltimore.
