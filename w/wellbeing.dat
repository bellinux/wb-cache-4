5|$|Women's {{health in}} India can be {{examined}} in terms of multiple indicators, which vary by geography, socioeconomic standing and culture. To adequately improve the health of women in India multiple dimensions of <b>wellbeing</b> must be analysed in relation to global health averages and also in comparison to men in India. Health {{is an important factor}} that contributes to human <b>wellbeing</b> and economic growth.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel very}} {{strongly}} that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position... it is vital for the prestige and future <b>wellbeing</b> of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.|$|E
5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton <b>Wellbeing</b> Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The <b>Wellbeing</b> Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E

It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and <b>wellbeing,</b> according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills. Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and {{is home to the}} University of Reading.|$|E
5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown <b>wellbeing,</b> perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. The breakdown well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When the breakdown position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Itachi debuts in Part I after Hiruzen's death, when he {{uses his}} {{infiltration}} of Konoha to hunt down Naruto Uzumaki {{as an excuse to}} secretly check on Sasuke's <b>wellbeing.</b> After engaging with Kakashi and some of Konoha's forces, he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki of the nine tailed beasts. Itachi also learns that Naruto is under the protection of Jiraiya and sets up a trap to lure the experienced ninja away to grab the boy. However, as Jiraiya comes to Naruto's aid, Itachi finds himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back on the path of getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall back.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore <b>wellbeing</b> and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|Ravana fights {{the final}} duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's <b>wellbeing,</b> Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} funded {{flood control}} projects involving {{the building of}} , thus aiding the speed of waterborne transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When {{the authority of the}} central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets which never had to rely on central government projects for their <b>wellbeing</b> or existence often sought support from powerful local families.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s <b>wellbeing</b> and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

25|$|Common market health {{measures}} such as GDP and GNP {{have been used as}} a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been {{explained by the fact that}} the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human <b>wellbeing.</b> Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult <b>wellbeing,</b> that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and <b>wellbeing</b> throughout the life course.|$|E
