5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} the laundry {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E

After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

As is usual in factories, repetition was a very prominent theme, and I later I used this as one of the cores of the project. From the <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> I created visual relationships based on the components themselves, and then I took this relationship to a 3 D medium which led me to some very interesting ideas.
