5|$|Engaging in <b>work</b> or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during <b>work</b> (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor <b>work</b> and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the <b>work</b> is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce <b>work</b> productivity since it becomes a distraction to the <b>work</b> rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
