5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight items in the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought {{that the possibility of}} two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> as to make the likelihood of the hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was born}} on 23 January 1899 in Whitchurch, Hampshire, to Charles Denning, a draper, and his wife Clara Denning (née Thompson). He was one of six children; his older brother Reginald Denning later became a noted staff officer with the British Army, {{and his younger brother}} Norman Denning became Director of Naval Intelligence and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence). Denning was born two months earlier than {{expected}} and almost died at birth; he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could fit in a pint pot. He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|The film's budget <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> {{that during}} the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{just before}} a crucial debate in campaign, Rove claimed that his office had been bugged by Democrats. The police and FBI {{investigated}} and discovered that the bug's battery <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that {{it needed to be}} changed every few hours, and the investigation was dropped. Critics, including other Republican operatives, suspected Rove had bugged his own office to garner sympathy votes in the close governor's race.|$|E
25|$|The raid on Harpers Ferry is {{generally}} {{thought to have}} done much to set the nation on a course toward civil war. Southern slaveowners, hearing initial reports that hundreds of abolitionists were involved, were relieved the effort <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small.</b> Yet they feared other abolitionists would emulate Brown and attempt to lead slave rebellions. Therefore, the South reorganized the decrepit militia system. These militias, well-established by 1861, became a ready-made Confederate army, making the South better prepared for war.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the church's construction, West Somers was a {{thriving}} agricultural community. Burials had begun in the cemetery almost a decade earlier; most of the area's congregants attended the established Mount Zion Methodist Church some distance away. One of West Somers's more prominent residents built the church so his neighbors would not always have to travel so far; it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, also a Somers resident, likened it to a tiger's cage.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{was not a}} {{profitable}} business for Bermudians in any case. The land area under cultivation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> (especially by comparison to the plots granted settlers in Virginia), that fields could {{not be allowed to}} lie fallow, and farmers attempted to produce three crops each year. Islanders quickly turned to shipbuilding and maritime trades, but the Company, which gained its profits only from the land under cultivation, forbade the construction of any vessels without its license. Its interference in Bermudians livelihood would lead to its dissolution in 1684.|$|E
25|$|Chief Designer James C. Floyd {{was upset}} by these developments, {{but in the}} end found a number of {{advantages}} to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an engine-out situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half, which made power tolerances easier to meet. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw {{in the case of an}} engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls.|$|E

However, since the margin of victory <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small,</b> a full recount of the elections took place. During the period, Rosselló filed a civil lawsuit against Acevedo Vilá himself over a dispute of certain ballots that were cast during the elections. Acevedo Vilá is also the first elected governor born after {{the adoption of the}} 1952 Constitution of Puerto Rico. Many independentistas voted for Governor Anibal Acevedo Vilá because they did not want the statehood candidate to win the tight race.|$|E
25|$|She {{was one of}} {{the first}} female emcees. Upon the {{introduction}} of Prohibition, she opened a speakeasy called the 300 Club at 151 W. 54th Street in New York City (1920). The club became famous for its troupe of 40 scantily clad fan dancers and for Guinan's distinctive aplomb, which made her a celebrity. Arrested several times for serving alcohol and providing entertainment, she always claimed that the patrons had brought the liquor in with them, and the club <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that the girls had to dance close to the customers. Guinan maintained that she had never sold an alcoholic drink in her life.|$|E
25|$|By 1 October, 50 P-40Es {{had also}} been shipped to the islands, and a new organization, the 24th Pursuit Group, stood up to control the three pursuit squadrons. Between 10 February and 20 November 1941 FEAF {{received}} 197 additional pilots, 141 of whom were or became pursuit pilots. All except 28 of the fighter pilots were fresh from flight schools and required further individual training, which cut into needed unit tactical training. Arrangements were made with the oxygen-producing plant in Manila, which supplied the U.S. Navy's shipyard at Cavite, to buy any surplus for pursuit units, but output <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that only the squadron at Nichols (which reopened on 17 October) could be supplied, and on a limited basis.|$|E

25|$|During these {{sessions}} the Federalist Party <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and weak that partisan divisions mattered {{much less than}} the personal relationships that developed among the members. McLane quickly became a friend and admirer of William H. Crawford and Martin Van Buren, {{and at the same time}} became an opponent of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. These friendships were based more on personality than policy agreement, and were so important that McLane was one of Crawford’s strongest proponents in the presidential election of 1824. Once Crawford returned to Georgia, McLane, Van Buren, and the other Crawford supporters fell into the party of Andrew Jackson. This was all the easier for him given his existing friendship with Martin Van Buren, who became his mentor and advocate.|$|E
25|$|The amount {{inferred}} {{for normal}} abundance of this heavy isotope of hydrogen <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in ocean water (156 deuteriums per million hydrogens)) {{that it had}} not noticeably affected previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why it hadn't been experimentally suspected before. Urey was able to concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. Lewis had prepared the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of deuterium, coming before the discovery of the neutron in 1932, was an experimental shock to theory, but when the neutron was reported, making deuterium's existence more explainable, deuterium won Urey the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934. Lewis was embittered by being passed over for this recognition given to his former student.|$|E
25|$|In his {{original}} {{version of his}} book Sex Without Guilt, Ellis expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are often needless and harmful to emotional health. He also famously debated religious psychologists, including Orval Hobart Mowrer and Allen Bergin, over the proposition that religion often contributed to psychological distress. Because of his forthright espousal of a nontheistic humanism, he was recognized in 1971 as Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. By 2003, {{he was one of}} the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Ellis most recently described himself as a probabilistic atheist, meaning that while he acknowledged that he could not be completely certain there is no god, he believed the probability a god exists <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that it was not worth his or anyone else's attention.|$|E
