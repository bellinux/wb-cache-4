40|$|Tools such as {{the carbon}} dioxide {{estimator}} tool from the UK Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and Aggregain {{have been developed to}} allow engineers to quantify and optimise carbon dioxide emissions associated with aggregate use. An extended <b>WRAP</b> <b>tool</b> methodology has been developed and is illustrated through assessing the relative carbon dioxide performance of different aggregate sourcing options for the large redevelopment project known as Masshouse, in the centre of Birmingham, UK. Previously unconsidered factors such as aggregate quality and highway congestion have been included. It is shown that significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved where site-derived demolition waste is reprocessed for use on site as a recycled aggregate and that relative haulage distances are of particular importance to overall carbon dioxide emissions. As these outcomes depend upon the distances to materials sources and sinks in Birmingham, it is concluded that the carbon dioxide emissions associated with aggregate sourcing are not just a function of material type but also of local conditions. Therefore, the developed methodology provides a useful decision-making framework for assessing aggregate sourcing that accounts for factors such as distribution of materials sources and sinks, aggregate grade, and the effects of road speed and congestion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A Tooling and Production Strategy for a Fully Integral, High Production Rate NLF Upper Wing Skin. Producing large {{integral}} composite components {{at a high}} {{production rate}} is a major challenge because the required level of process maturity is extremely high. Further more only a highly streamlined and optimised production approach can provide the required competitiveness. For a typical single aisle aircraft wing skin a length of up to 20 m and typical laminate thicknesses of up to 25 mm can be expected. In addition only secondary bonding or fully integral design approaches can provide the surface smoothness required for Natural Laminar Flow capabilities. In {{the framework of the}} LUFOIV Project LaWiPro it was decided to go for a fully integral design approach with integrated stringers and integrated rib caps following the tradition of the first Airbus CFRP VTP. In order to optimise the production sequence priority was given to minimised set-up and processing times. The so called “Shoe Box” solution that is currently investigated is based on a manufacturing optimised wing skin design without undercuts and interleaved Stringer, Rib Cap and Wing Skin plies. The production sequence starts with the <b>wrapping</b> of Hollow <b>Tooling</b> Modules that are afterwards combined to a row. Several rows of <b>wrapped</b> <b>Tooling</b> Modules are than placed on the referencing tooling base plate and covered with additional wing skin plies. After the set-up phase the tool is closed and placed in an autoclave or convection oven. To reduce the cycle time the Hollow Tooling Modules are connected to the process environment and there is a controlled airflow through the Tooling Modules. In the end the geometrical precision of the aerodynamic surfaces and also the joining areas is investigated with a contact-free high precision GOM-ATOS measuring equipment. Even though the first trials are based on prepreg it is an option to combine the prepreg wing skin laminate (e. g. ATL, AFP) with infused stringers and rib caps (Combined Prepreg Infusion (CPI)) or to chose a complete Infusion based approach. To evaluate the competitiveness of the “Shoe Box” solution all activities are accompanied by a related cost assessment that indicates areas that need to be improved from a maturity point of view or where automation concepts could be successfully applied to further reduce production costs. ...|$|R

40|$|Tool {{manufacturers}} {{continue to}} incorporate new designs {{to the internal}} mechanism of tools in order to decrease the vibration that is delivered to the hand during operation. Modification of some tools to minimize tool vibration is not easily resolved through internal tool design. For this reason, vibration damping materials applied between the tool and the hand are a simple alternative. The damping materials may {{be applied to the}} area of the tool directly contacted by the operator or in a glove containing a vibration absorbing pad. These interventions are developed specifically to damp vibration but are not necessarily produced and tested under the same work conditions that a company may expose their workers. Therefore, it is important to test the value of the proposed interventions for the specific applications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of anti-vibration interventions currently in use at a local manufacturing company. Methods The design of this study evaluates the vibration energy produced at the tool handle and {{from the back of the}} operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s hand. Each operator performed a series of fastener installations in metal using several interventions and one series with no intervention as a control. Four of the interventions were gloves containing anti-vibration material and the fifth intervention was an anti-vibration material <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>tool</b> handle. The protocol for <b>wrapping</b> the <b>tool</b> handle was developed and is part of the equipment procedure at this manufacturing company. Test conditions mimicked production work conditions including similar materials, fasteners and technique for installation. Vibration values were collected using 3 tri-axial accelerometers with one firmly glued to the tool handle close the hand grip as recommended by ISO 5349. A second accelerometer was placed on the top of the pistol shaped tool. The third accelerometer was attached to the back of the hand close to the third knuckle using double sided tape. Results Preliminary results for 3 volunteers show a difference between the vibration values of the control condition (mean hand vibration on bare hand = 1. 77 Gs) compared to all of the interventions (p=. 0001 using Mixed Procedure, Tests of Fixed Effects). The graph below shows individual trials for each subject for each condition. Glove 3 with the air bladder insert shows large variability between subjects (Range = 0. 84 - 3. 33 Gs).

50|$|The {{artifact}} {{can then}} be inserted into the slit, and fixed to the shaft by tying around the flanges with a suitable material. Materials such as Australian Sea Grass Cordage, and split deer intestine can {{be used due to}} its high strength and durability once installed. Some people will wrap the material around the handle as well to add grip. The main disadvantage with <b>wrapping</b> the <b>tool</b> onto the shaft arises after usage when the fibers lose their tension and become loose. High humidity is also a contributing factor to the fibers losing tension. On occasion, glue is added for extra support. When glue or any other resin is used, the hafting is said to be mastic. Mastic hafts are also very strong and reliable since there is little to no movement of the tool. Glue also has an advantage of absorbing shock when hardened, which helps with cushioning. Back before glue was readily available, people would process deer hide into glue. The main downside of mastic hafts is the time consuming and difficult construction process. Alternatively, the head may simply be forced into the shaft, if the shaft is soft enough, eliminating the need for a slit (and perhaps improving durability). If a strap is used, it is tied directly to the flanges of the artifact.|$|R

40|$|The {{revolution}} of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) has set off the globalization of information publishing and access. Organizations, enterprises, and individuals produce and update data on the Web everyday. With the explosive growth {{of information on the}} WWW, it becomes more and more difficult for users to accurately find and completely retrieve what they want. Although there are hundreds of thousands of general-purpose and special-purpose search engines and search tools, most users still find it hard to retrieve information precisely. Moreover, considering the great amount of valuable information hidden in the Invisible Web that is generally inaccessible to traditional "crawlers", providing users with an effective and efficient tool for Web searching is necessary and urgent. First, this dissertation proposes an adaptive data model for meta-search engines (ADMIRE) {{that can be used to}} formally and meticulously describe the user interfaces and query capabilities of heterogeneous search engines on the Internet. Compared with related work, this model focuses more on the constraints between the terms, term modifiers, attribute order, and the impact of logical operators. Second, this dissertation presents a constraint-based query translation algorithm. When translating a query from a meta-search engine to a remote source, the mediator considers the function and position restrictions of terms, term modifiers and logical operators among the controls in the user interfaces to the underlying sources sufficiently, thus allowing the meta-search engine to utilize the query capabilities of the specific sources as far as possible. In addition, a two-phase query subsuming mechanism is put forward to compensate for the functional discrepancies between sources, in order to make a more accurate query translation. Furthermore, this dissertation presents a mechanism for constructing adaptive, dynamically generated user interfaces for meta-search engines based on the above-mentioned model. The concept of control constraint rules has been proposed and applied to the user interface construction. Depending on the state of interaction between users and system, such meta-search engines adapt their interfaces to the concrete user interfaces of differing kinds of search engines (Boolean model with differing syntax, vector-space/probabilistic model, natural language support, etc.), so as to overcome the constraints of heterogeneous search engines and utilize the functionality of the individual search engines as much as possible. Finally, this dissertation also tackles some issues on wrapper generation and result merging for Web information sources. The experiments show that an information integration system with an adaptive, dynamically generated user interface, coordinating the constraints among the heterogeneous sources, will greatly improve the effectiveness of integrated information searching, and will utilize the query capabilities of sources as far as possible. The adaptive meta-search engine architecture proposed in this dissertation has been applied to the information integration of scientific publications-oriented search engines. It can also be applied to other generic domains or specific domains of information integration, such as integrating all kinds of WWW search engines (or search tools) and online repositories with quite different user interfaces and query models. With the help of source <b>wrapping</b> <b>tools,</b> they can also be used to integrate queryable information sources delivering semi-structured or non-structured data, such as product catalogues, weather reports, software directories, and so on...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{possibility}} of partial reconfiguration of FPGAs during run-time {{can be used}} to implement systems that adapt their execution area over time. Such resource optimization is especially beneficial in the embedded systems domain. However, for detailed investigations of partial reconfiguration, the two topics modeling and practical realization of reconfigurable systems must be rooted in the design process. We present a tool that meets this requirement. It was developed to ease the design of partial bitstreams for Xilinx FPGAs for research purpose. The <b>tool</b> <b>wraps</b> the obstacles of partial bitstream generation, motivating people new to this field. Moreover, the backend of the tool, a single UML class diagram that represents the whole characteristics of the reconfigurable system under development abstractly, allows to model reconfigurable systems in a comprehensive manner on a high level of abstraction. The UML diagram is filled during the design process until enough information for the generation of bitstreams is available. Thus, it serves as possibility to demonstrate the dependencies as well as the versatility of reconfigurable systems – (embedded) systems that conduct the execution of algorithms or tasks in space and time.
