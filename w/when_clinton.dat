5|$|The British Navy in New York had {{not been}} inactive. Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier engaged {{in a number of}} amphibious raids agaynst coastal {{communities}} from Chesapeake Bay to Connecticut, and probed at American defences in the Hudson River valley. Coming up the river in force, he supported the key outpost capture of Stony Point, but advanced no further. <b>When</b> <b>Clinton</b> weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organised a counterstrike. Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but their morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when their failure to co-operate with the French led to an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the British from Savannah. Control of Georgia was formally returned to its royal governor, James Wright, in July 1779, but the backcountry would not come under British control until after the 1780 Siege of Charleston. Patriot forces recovered Augusta by siege in 1781, but Savannah remained in British hands until 1782. The damage sustained at Savannah forced Marseillois, Zélé, Sagittaire, Protecteur and Experiment to return to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{incoming}} Republican majority's {{promise to}} slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda for Medicare, education, the environment and public health, eventually leading to a temporary shutdown of the U.S. federal government.

Democratic leaders vigorously attacked Gingrich for the budget standoff and his public image suffered heavily.|$|E

25|$|In Huckabee's first {{political}} race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 {{percent of}} the vote in the general election. In the same election, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was elected president, making lieutenant governor Jim Guy Tucker the new governor <b>when</b> <b>Clinton</b> resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year, 51–49 percent. Huckabee became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.|$|E
25|$|At Surrey he {{immediately}} formed a successful opening partnership with Alan Butcher which lasted until the 1986 season when Butcher suffered {{a loss of}} form and was dropped down the order and then omitted from the side before being released by Surrey {{at the end of}} the season. Their first wicket stands included 277 against Yorkshire in 1984, <b>when</b> <b>Clinton</b> made his highest score of 192, and 266 against Cambridge University in 1980. Butcher and Clinton shared 19 century opening partnerships for Surrey. He opened the batting with Butcher in Surrey's match against Essex at Chelmsford in May 1983 when Surrey were bowled out for 14 runs, the lowest score in English first-class cricket since 1907 and Surrey's lowest first-class score ever. Clinton top-scored with six runs in the first innings before scoring 65 not out as Surrey batted through their second innings to draw the match.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778 saw {{a colonial}} American army under Major General George Washington fight a British army led by Lieutenant General Henry Clinton. After {{evacuating}} Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 18, Clinton intended to march his 13,000-man army to New York City. Washington sent 6,400 troops commanded by Major General Charles Lee {{to attack the}} British column of march near Monmouth Court House, New Jersey. <b>When</b> <b>Clinton</b> counterattacked, Lee ordered his badly deployed troops to fall back immediately. Washington brought up 7,000 men to support Lee's withdrawing wing and held his ground against repeated British assaults. That evening Clinton retreated {{from the field and}} continued his march to Sandy Hook, where the British fleet waited to ferry his army to New York. Both armies' casualties were about even in the last major battle in the northern colonies. Lee was court martialed for his behavior during the battle.|$|E

Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable {{to return to}} the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted <b>when</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981. When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as Ain't But the One Way in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone disappeared from the limelight and entered drug rehabilitation in 1984, at the insistence of his old friend Bobby Womack. Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.|$|E

500|$|... b. According to Meginness (Chapter 14), Wayne Township {{was formed}} from Nippenose Township in 1798, while part of Lycoming County. Note that the PHMC sheet on Clinton County {{incorrectly}} {{says it was}} formed as part of Northumberland County, but neither the Lycoming nor Northumberland County histories support this. <b>When</b> <b>Clinton</b> County was formed in 1839, there were 12 original townships. It [...] "embraced the following townships then in Centre County, viz., Bald Eagle, Lamar, and Logan; and from Lycoming, Allison, Chapman, Colebrook, Dunstable, Grove, Lumber, Limestone, Pine Creek, and Wayne." [...] Since Lamar was formed from Bald Eagle, 11 of the 12 original townships came at least indirectly from Lycoming County. Limestone was split from the Lycoming County township of the same name, then attached to Wayne Township, and renamed Crawford Township when it was reformed. Grove and Lumber townships became part of Cameron County, but the remaining ten townships are still in Clinton County.|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 Democratic {{presidential primary}} campaign, Clinton vigorously {{advocated}} {{on behalf of}} his wife, Hillary Clinton. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10million toward her campaign. Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad. Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania. Considering Bill's remarks, many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary. Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, <b>when</b> <b>Clinton</b> enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is [...] "ready to lead". After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.|$|E
