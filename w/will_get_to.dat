5|$|Medical {{examiner}} Blythe (Wendy Hughes) {{leaves her}} visiting son Danny (Stivi Paskoski) {{with her boyfriend}} Bolander (Ned Beatty) for the day, with the hopes they <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know each other better. Danny rides along with Bolander and Munch (Richard Belzer) on their murder investigations, but acts very wild and constantly asks inappropriate questions. At dinner later, Danny asks Bolander about his sex life with Danny's mother, making Bolander extremely uncomfortable. Bolander later tells Blythe he believes her son is crazy. Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{spends a lot of}} time with his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up. Thormann's wife, Eva (Edie Falco), tells Crosetti she is pregnant, but that her husband reacted angrily to the news. Thormann tells Crosetti he should have died at the hospital and can never be a good father, but Crosetti encourages him.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Henry Sy Sr. Hall {{began on}} December 2, 2010 {{as part of}} the university's Centennial Renewal Plan, a project that aims to {{construct}} and renovate facilities inside the campus. A 15-floor building, it replaced DLSU's football field with plans for completion by December 2012. It is estimated to cost ₱1.4billion (US$32.5million). In line with this, DLSU entered an eight-year agreement with the Philippine Sports Commission. Under the contract, DLSU will fund the ₱7.4million (US$171,000) renovation of the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium. DLSU <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> use the facilities in return.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that this {{function}} only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. We <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a two-dimensional array q rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array q to see if the path cost is already there.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|When {{a player}} owns {{all of the}} {{properties}} in a color group {{and none of them}} are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces, and must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank, then a housing auction is conducted to determine who <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> purchase each house.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, Double Fine, and the Humble Bundle group began another charity drive titled Amnesia Fortnight 2014. During this drive, {{those that}} paid {{a minimum of}} $1 had the {{opportunity}} to vote on 29 concept ideas. In addition, those that paid more than the average <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> vote on a concept idea for a prototype led by Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. As with Amnesia Fortnight 2012, 2 Player Productions filmed the production of the prototype, which was available to people who purchased the bundle, as well as on a Blu-ray, along with the prototypes on a DVD, for those who paid a minimum of $35. The four pitches that were made into prototypes for Amnesia Fortnight 2014 were Dear Leader, an emergent narrative game led by Anna Kipnis, Little Pink Best Buds, a game about little pink creatures who want to be your friend led by Pendleton Ward, Mnemonic, a surreal, first-person noir adventure led by Derek Brand, and Steed, a game set in a storybook land full of inept heroes led by John Bernhelm. One idea, Bad Golf 2, was not selected as a prototype, but a group of Double Fine fans have started working on developing the title themselves, with the blessing of its conceptor, Patrick Hackett and permission of Double Fine.|$|E

500|$|For {{the series}} finale, Mowry and Hall reprised {{their roles as}} Melanie and Derwin even though Mowry had written on her Facebook page {{that she would not}} {{reappear}} on the show. Hall announced their return during the 2015 BET Awards, where the show's cast had attended to say [...] "their final goodbyes". Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: [...] "To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing. They get an ending. They get closure." [...] She added that their storyline would appeal to the show's fans, explaining: [...] "I feel creatively we've been able to answer those who have been loyal to us. It's truly a tip of the hat to the fans who <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see if Melanie and Derwin get their happily-ever-after." ...|$|E

He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. [...] "Quite often, I'm {{trying to write}} {{a certain kind of}} song and it's more ambitious than what my voice <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to.</b> That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind".

It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But I still think it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{scheduled}} debut {{air date}} for Gone Too Far had been October 5, 2009. After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged {{the possibility that}} placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show {{in the wake of}} his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: [...] "It is our hope through airing this show that people <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, [...] "there was never any doubt" [...] the film would be dedicated to him.|$|E

500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Rachel's {{pregnancy}} storyline with saving Friends, {{observing that}} the arc increased the show's ratings while ultimately [...] "reversing the show's decline in ways ... {{that no one}} watching 'The One With Monica & Chandler's Wedding' could ever have imagined." [...] Bianco concluded, [...] "Indeed, without that fortune-altering twist, Friends probably would have ended sooner". BDCwire ranked [...] "The One With The Ball", [...] "The One With Rachel’s Inadvertent Kiss", [...] "The One With The Football", [...] "The One With The Fake Party" [...] and [...] "The One In Vegas, Part One" [...] Rachel's five strongest episodes. Meanwhile, TVLine criticized Rachel for sleeping with ex-fiancé Barry in season one's [...] "The One With the Evil Orthodontist", panning the episode as [...] "cringeworthy". TVLine similarly criticized the character's role in season four's [...] "The One With The Fake Party". At times the character would generate mild controversy, specifically the second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies", during which Rachel and Monica argue over who <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> use the last remaining condom in the apartment, which Rachel ultimately wins via a game of rock-paper-scissors. Additionally, fans would often approach Aniston and scold her for decisions that Rachel makes within the show {{that they do not}} particularly agree with.|$|E
