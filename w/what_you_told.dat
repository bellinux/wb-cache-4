"The Carolina {{fans that}} week were {{carrying}} around a poster {{with the image}} of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail," [...] Jay McCormick said. [...] "Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. [...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going to do exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> them not to do." ...|$|E

60|$|She started. 'Because of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me!' The Captain grew very unhappy; {{but he was}} undeterred.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must know}} if <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me has any bearing on your request that I should {{recommend}} Captain Sedgwick's appointment?" ...|$|R
60|$|FANNY [she seats {{herself and}} {{suggests}} {{to him the}} writing-chair]. Hear from you--first of all--exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> Vernon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} mitigated; state them clearly. Include <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> {{me about the}} trouble with the natives, and the {{poisoned}} arrows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think Uncle Cosham would object, {{especially}} {{hearing it}} {{while he is}} here," [...] said Meta--"and if he knew <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>told</b> me, Doctor Rochecliffe," [...] said Alice, [...] "of {{the risk}} of communicating this great secret to my father." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I tell you, Sir, I can't see my {{way through}} it at all. Chance! what chance would there be, after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'I thought,' I replied, 'there {{might be}} a doubt about it; though of course I have {{forgotten}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me two years ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] I said. [...] "I {{thought you}} were rather fond of {{children}} from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me going to the cross-roads the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me," [...] he said gravely, [...] "I {{have not}} the least doubt but that my wife and your mother were sisters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Vewy well, fadder,' says you, in {{your own}} sweet way, for you was always a biddable child, an' did <b>what</b> <b>you</b> was <b>told</b> without axin' questions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Slidder," [...] said I, as {{we turned}} {{down into the}} mean-looking alley where Mrs Willis, my little old woman, dwelt, [...] "I am greatly {{interested}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me about my little dog, and I am interested still more in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me about yourself.

6000|$|... "I am {{not angry}} with you, aunt--I wish I were," [...] said Mr. Warrington, with very great emotion. [...] "I--I shall not repeat <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me once, about her {{making all the}} apple parsties and doing all the cooking?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{little lady}} smiled again. [...] "I offer you my sincere apologies, Mr. Austin. And now a question. Did <b>you</b> tell Jacinta <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} she could not speak, and then she whispered, [...] "I believe that I have seen <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me I should see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said she, [...] "I {{will tell}} you something, in return for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{understand}} each other," [...] he said. [...] "She has committed {{an act of}} deception to the injury of another woman. Was that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me {{a day or}} two since?" [...] asked the doctor. [...] "You said there was a chance of Mr. Armadale's dying in my Sanitarium?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, why shouldn't I?" [...] she cried, [...] "after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me. And {{could you}} think I didn't understand, from the beginning, that it meant this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Horn, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me are {{the plans}} and {{opinions}} of others. It {{seems to me}} that you are now called upon to say something for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> repeat <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were <b>told</b> {{to say to}} Revere, I {{will see}} to it that you are made more comfortable," [...] Haines said, after a long pause.|$|R

6000|$|... "Remember <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me {{last night}} in the sacred confidences of yonder holy church, and hear what you really are from the lips of the Council of Todos Santos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It doesn't hurt. It isn't anything,' said Mrs. Boulte feebly. 'That doesn't matter. Tell him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me. Say {{you don't}} care for him. Oh, Ted, won't you believe her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{go round}} {{and let the}} boys know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me. They can meet outside Ransome's shanty. The dinner-hour will do. I'll be there to meet them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know that? I thought Billy Dill knew. If <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me is true, {{you are the}} son of my twin brother, David Breslow Porter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And your brother," [...] I added, [...] "took {{the other}} side, {{and tried to}} persuade me to marry you first. How can you {{reconcile}} that with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> me----" ...|$|R
