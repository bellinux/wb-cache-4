500|$|During {{his brief}} {{career in the}} NFL, Leaf {{appeared}} in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 317 of 655 (48.4%) passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions and a career quarterback rating of only 50.0. After hearing of Leaf's retirement, Rodney Harrison, {{one of his most}} outspoken critics on the Chargers, said, [...] "He took the money and ran. Personally, I could never rest good at night knowing my career ended like that.

It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{control room}} with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment {{was set up}} in Danesmoate's dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed [...] "non-studio" [...] atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the [...] "lyric room" [...] and the recording space was called the [...] "band room". Lanois' strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of the essence of a live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing to fall back on. This was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in sound isolation, gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, [...] "you have to make a commitment to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> down and either use it or throw it all away." [...] This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.|$|E

Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue, Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash, And then add soul and heighten them three-fold? Or say there's beauty with no soul at all-- (I never saw it--put the case the same--) If you get simple beauty and naught else, You get about the best thing God invents: That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed, Within yourself, when you return him thanks. [...] 220 [...] "Rub all out! [...] "Well, well, there's my life, in short, And so the thing has gone on ever since.

Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front-- Those great rings serve more purposes than just To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!

[...] 240 Don't you think they're the likeliest to know, They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage, Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't; For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints-- A laugh, a cry, the business of the world-- <(Flower o' the peach, Death for us all, and his own life for each!)> And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over, [...] 250 The world and life's too big to pass for a dream, And I do these wild things in sheer despite, And play the fooleries you catch me at, In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so, Although the miller does not preach to him The only good of grass is to make chaff. What would men have? Do they like grass or no-- May they or may n't they? all I want's the thing Settled forever one way. As it is, [...] 260 You tell too many lies and hurt yourself: You don't like what you only like too much, You do like what, if given you at your word, You find abundantly detestable.

[...] First, every sort of monk, the black and white, [...] 145 [...] I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church, [...] From good old gossips waiting to confess [...] Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends-- [...] To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot, [...] Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there [...] 150 [...] With the little children round him in a row [...] Of admiration, half for his beard and half [...] For that white anger of his victim's son [...] Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm, [...] Signing himself with the other because of Christ [...] 155 [...] (Whose sad face on the cross sees only this [...] After the passion of a thousand years) [...] Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head, [...] (Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve [...] On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf, [...] 160 [...] Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers [...] (The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone. [...] I painted all, then cried, [...] "'Tis ask and have; [...] Choose, for more's ready!"--laid the ladder flat, [...] And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall. [...] 165 [...] The monks closed in a circle and praised loud [...] Till checked, taught what to see and not to see, [...] Being simple bodies--"That's the very man! [...] Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog! [...] That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes [...] 170 [...] To care about his asthma: it's the life!" [...] But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked; [...] Their betters took their turn to see and say: [...] The Prior and the learned pulled a face [...] And stopped all that in no time. [...] "How? what's here? [...] 175 [...] Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all! [...] Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true [...] As much as pea and pea! It's devil's-game! [...] Your business is not to catch men with show, [...] With homage to the perishable clay, [...] 180 [...] But lift them over it, ignore it all, [...] Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh. [...] Your business is to paint the souls of men--- [...] Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke ... no, it's not ... It's vapor done up like a new-born babe-- [...] 185 [...] (In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth) [...] It's ... well, what matters talking, it's the soul! [...] Give us no more of body than shows soul! [...] Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God, [...] That sets us praising--why not stop with him? [...] 190 [...] Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head [...] With wonder at lines, colors, and what not? [...] Paint the soul; never mind the legs and arms! [...] Rub all out; try at it a second time. [...] Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts, [...] 195 [...] She's just my niece ... Herodias, I would say-- [...] Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off! [...] Have it all out!" [...] Now, is this sense, I ask? [...] A fine way to paint soul, by painting body [...] So ill the eye can't stop there, must go further, [...] 200 [...] And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white [...] When <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> for yellow's simply black, [...] And any sort of meaning looks intense [...] When all beside itself means and looks naught. [...] Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn, [...] 205 [...] Left foot and right foot, go a double step, [...] Make his flesh liker and his soul more like, [...] Both in their order? Take the prettiest face, [...] The Prior's niece ... patron-saint--is it so pretty [...] You can't discover if it means hope, fear, [...] 210 [...] Sorrow, or joy? Won't beauty go with these? [...] Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue, [...] Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash, [...] And then add soul and heighten them three-fold? [...] Or say there's beauty with no soul at all-- [...] 215 [...] (I never saw it--put the case the same--) [...] If you get simple beauty and naught else, [...] You get about the best thing God invents: [...] That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed, [...] Within yourself, when you return Him thanks. [...] 220 [...] "Rub all out!" [...] Well, well, there's my life, in short, [...] And so the thing has gone on ever since. [...] I'm grown a man no doubt; I've broken bounds: [...] You should not take a fellow eight years old [...] And make him swear to never kiss the girls. [...] 225 [...] I'm my own master, paint now as I please-- [...] Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house! [...] Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front-- [...] Those great rings serve more purposes than just [...] To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse! [...] 230 [...] And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes [...] Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work, [...] The heads shake still--"It's art's decline, my son! [...] You're not of the true painters, great and old; [...] Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find; [...] 235 [...] Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer: [...] Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!" [...] Flower o' the pine, [...] You keep your mist ... manners, and I'll stick to mine! [...] I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know! [...] 240 [...] Don't you think they're the likeliest to know, [...] They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage, [...] Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint [...] To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't; [...] For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come [...] 245 [...] A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints-- [...] A laugh, a cry, the business of the world-- [...] (Flower o' the peach, [...] Death for us all, and his own life for each!) [...] And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over, [...] 250 [...] The world and life's too big to pass for a dream, [...] And I do these wild things in sheer despite, [...] And play the fooleries you catch me at, [...] In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass [...] After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so, [...] 255 [...] Although the miller does not preach to him [...] The only good of grass is to make chaff. [...] What would men have? Do they like grass or no-- [...] May they or mayn't they? All I want's the thing [...] Settled forever one way. As it is, [...] 260 [...] You tell too many lies and hurt yourself: [...] You don't like what you only like too much, [...] You do like what, if given you at your word, [...] You find abundantly detestable. [...] For me, I think I speak as I was taught; [...] 265 [...] I always see the garden and God there [...] A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned, [...] The value and significance of flesh, [...] I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.|$|E
