5|$|The {{victory in}} Chacabuco did not {{liberate}} all Chile. Royalist forces still resisted in southern Chile, {{allied with the}} mapuches. Las Heras occupied Concepción, but failed to occupy Talcahuano. The royalist resistance lasted for several months, and Talcahuano was only captured <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continent was already free.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Germany {{became a}} nation state <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the {{revolution}} of 1918–19, the Empire {{was replaced by}} the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Loxton {{helped to}} select David Hookes {{to make his}} debut in the Centenary Test, after {{receiving}} a recommendation from Bradman, who had retired from the panel. Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win. The later period of Loxton's tenure was thrown into chaos <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket—which offered substantially more remuneration—meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit. During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats.|$|E
5|$|MRT lines {{operate from}} 5:30am to before 1:00am daily, with the {{exception}} of selected periods such as New Year's Eve, Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya, Christmas, eves of public holidays, and special occasions such as the state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew (2015), <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines stay open throughout the night or extended till later. MRT serves as an essential purpose of transport owing to the support from various organisations and being a car-lite society.|$|E

5|$|Many modern historians, {{who usually}} {{consider}} Herodotus more reliable, add the 1,000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men {{as a standard}} number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians. However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed {{later on in the}} battle <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).|$|E
5|$|NY141 was {{established}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally followed Marble Avenue from Thornwood to Pleasantville; however, it was realigned in the 1940s to follow Broadway between Thornwood and NY117, then routed on Bedford Road, in Pleasantville. In the late 1930s, NY141 was extended southwestward to Eastview by way of modern NY9A and the now-dismantled Old Saw Mill River Road. This change was reverted on January 1, 1949 <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway became part of a realigned NY9A. On September1, 1980, NY141 was extended two blocks northward after NY117 was rerouted to follow Manville Road through Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|Profitability was maintained, {{with the}} result then <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shropshire Union network of canals were {{abandoned}} in 1944, the sections which had originally been the Chester Canal, the Ellesmere Canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Middlewich Branch were all retained. The only other section which was not abandoned was the Llangollen branch; this was kept because of its function as a water supply channel, rather than for navigation.|$|E
50|$|The Uniting Church in Australia (UCA) was {{established}} on 22 June 1977 <b>when</b> <b>most</b> congregations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Methodist Church <b>of</b> Australasia, about two thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian Church <b>of</b> Australia {{and almost all}} <b>the</b> churches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congregational Union <b>of</b> Australia came together under <b>the</b> Basis <b>of</b> Union.|$|R
50|$|The {{state was}} {{dissolved}} on 14 October 1955 <b>when</b> <b>most</b> regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western wing <b>of</b> Pakistan were merged to form <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> West Pakistan.

50|$|Calbayog has well {{distributed}} rainfall {{throughout the}} year, except during <b>the</b> summer months <b>of</b> February through May, <b>when</b> <b>most</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city are dry.

Heavy downpour is seldom {{experienced in the}} locality, therefore making Calbayog potentially appropriate for protective agricultural investment.|$|R
5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent {{during the first week of}} the rash, <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin lesions are intact. Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.|$|E
5|$|The supreme {{responsibility}} for conservation {{lies with the}} Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated the management to the Governor of Svalbard and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. The foundation for conservation {{was established in the}} Svalbard Treaty of 1920, and has been further specified in the Svalbard Environmental Act of 2001. The first round of protection took force on 1 July 1973, <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current protected areas came into effect. This included the two large nature reserves and three of the national parks. Moffen Nature Reserve was established in 1983, followed by four national parks, three nature reserves and one geotope protection area between 2002 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two years}} {{following}} the battle, Curtis had brief periods in command of HMS Canada, HMS Powerful, HMS Invincible and HMS Formidable. In 1796, {{he was promoted to}} rear-admiral and raised his flag on HMS Prince. In Prince, Curtis led the blockade of Brest <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet was paralysed by the Spithead Mutiny. He was also in overall command of the naval operations which succeeded in destroying or driving off much of the French force sent to support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 culminating in the Battle of Tory Island, at which he was not present. Later in the year he joined Lord St Vincent off Cadiz with a squadron of eight ships of the line, and was soon afterwards made a vice-admiral. In 1799, he retired ashore.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Pisa {{remained}} in North African waters until mid-December <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Squadron returned to Italy. Pisa later escorted several troop transports from Augusta, Sicily {{in an attempt}} to seize the port of Zuara shortly before Christmas that was foiled by bad weather. In mid-April 1912 the Italian fleet sortied into the eastern Aegean Sea with Pisa and Amalfi leading {{in an attempt to}} lure out the Ottoman fleet. When that failed, the Italians bombarded the fortifications defending the Dardanelles to little effect before the main body departed for Italy on the 19th. Pisa, Amalfi, and an assortment of smaller craft were left behind, however, to continue destroying telegraph and radio stations and cutting underwater cables. Sailors from the two cruisers captured the island of Astropalia on 28 April to allow Italian forces to use it as supply base. A week later, the ship supported the occupation of Rhodes on 4 May. Pisa returned to Italy in September, but after the war ended she spent the first half of 1913 in Constantinople and the Aegean before returning to Taranto on 24 June.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit <b>when</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E
