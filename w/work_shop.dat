25|$|The {{most recent}} {{statistics}} show {{a decrease in}} the population of the city, to 205,934 in the middle of 2009. This is mainly because quite a large number of citizens have been moving to nearby communities, adjacent to the formal administrative area of Toruń, but still outside it. As a result, Toruń is surrounded by a belt of densely populated settlements, whose inhabitants <b>work,</b> <b>shop</b> and entertain in the city proper, but do not officially live there.|$|E

This space is pedestrian friendly, creating an accessible space for all. Overall, Markham aims to put its residents and their families first, bringing jobs closer into its boundaries and protecting the environment.|$|E

We are all aware of the role the pharmacy plays in providing patients with 60 million-plus prescription medicines every year. But, over the years, more and more people have been recognising community pharmacies as sources of help and advice – particularly about how to lead a healthier lifestyle – and a provider of health checks." ...|$|E

There are more than 700 pharmacies across Wales situated where people <b>work,</b> <b>shop</b> and live.

[...] Gliding was still conducted up till early 1960's as well at the Common with a winch truck used to winch the gliders to sufficient thermaling height. Returning to land was sometimes left a little late with low height remaining after a flight with one tree alongside the Moorabool street bridge reduced in height somewhat by a low passing glider. The glider shed was located approximately under the present main intersection at Barwon Heads / Settlement road intersection. This shed later became the first home of the Bellarine railway group and {{was the site of}} filming for a Sullivans episode showing old WW.11 steam trains. Remains of the initial rail spur can be seen heading towards the golf course. It was planned to extend the rail line along the river reserve towards Highton. As well as full size aero and glider activities the Common was used by model flyers as well. Initially control line and free flight models until use of early radio control models in 1966/7. By mid 1967 a social flying group had been formed by the local flyers [...] Geelong Aero Guidance Society was formed in Barry A's garage in Belmont [...] They remained at the Common for a few more years until late 70's they found a new site at Dog Rocks after wide spread use of high powered CB radios in Geelong caused interference to the radio control equipment.|$|E

But factory <b>work,</b> <b>shop</b> work, and all employments of that sort, are in their nature essentially undomestic,--entailing the constant necessity of a boarding-house life, and of habits as different as possible from the quiet routine of home. The girl who is ten hours on the strain of continued, unintermitted toil feels no inclination, when evening comes, to sit down and darn her stockings, or make over her dresses, or study any of those multifarious economies which turn a wardrobe to the best account. Her nervous system is flagging; she craves company and excitement; and her dull, narrow room is deserted for some place of amusement or gay street promenade. And who can blame her? Let any sensible woman, who has had experience of shop and factory life, recall to her mind the ways and manners in which young girls grow up who leave a father's roof for a crowded boarding-house, without any supervision of matron or mother, and ask whether this is the best school for training young American wives and mothers.|$|E
