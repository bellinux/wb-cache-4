5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006.

No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v.
