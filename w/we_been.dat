500|$|In early 1844, Halkett {{successfully}} {{tested a}} prototype boat-cloak on the River Thames, paddling it [...] without taking on any water, despite, in his words, being [...] "met by—passed by—and almost run down by—various Metropolitan Steamers plying {{to and fro}} in their several vocations, and causing no little commotion in the troubled waters of the River". Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using it whenever the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett hoped to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the Bay of Biscay, but the weather was unusually calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that [...] "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant". The boat-cloak was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that [...] "Had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have been a bit more tense had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Duncan's initial tactics at {{the battle}} were {{reminiscent}} of those of Howe at the Glorious First of June, and his eventual attack {{has been compared to}} Nelson's tactics at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Duncan credited the tactical work Essay on Naval Tactics by John Clerk of Eldin for inspiring his decisions on the day. Duncan was subsequently indirectly criticised some years after the battle by his colleague Earl St Vincent, who had won the Battle of Cape St Vincent over a Spanish fleet nine months before Camperdown. In a letter complaining of Clerk's assertion that he had been responsible for all of the major naval victories of the war, St Vincent wrote that Duncan [...] "was a brave officer, little versed in the subtleties of naval tactics, and who would have been quickly embarrassed by them. When he saw the enemy, he rushed upon him without thinking of such and such and order of battle. To conquer he calculated upon the brave example he set his captains, and the event justified his expectation." [...] This assessment was refuted by Captain Hotham, who publicly responded that [...] "the advanced season of the year and the close proximity of the enemy's coast all made what, upon another occasion, might have appeared haste imperatively necessary, for it was the prompt decision of the Admiral that occasioned the result". Some modern historians, such as Peter Padfield, have agreed with Hotham's assertion, with the added suggestion that Duncan's tactics during the battle might have had an influence on the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who was in England recovering from the loss of his right arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife at the time of Camperdown. Duncan himself felt that he could have done more, noting that [...] "We were obliged ... to be rather rash in our attack. Had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> ten leagues at sea none would have escaped." [...] but some of the highest praise came from his erstwhile opponent, De Winter, who wrote that [...] "Your not waiting to form line ruined me: if I had got nearer the shore and you had attacked, I should probably have drawn both fleets on it, {{and it would have been}} a victory for me, being on my own coast." [...] Duncan's health deteriorated after the battle, forcing his retirement from the Navy in 1799 and contributing to his death at Cornhill-on-Tweed in 1804.|$|E

500|$|Angel season four {{played with}} audience's {{expectations}} of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, [...] "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy." [...] She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; [...] director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode [...] "Orpheus" [...] because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new [...] "schizophrenic madwoman" [...] characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a [...] 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline [...] "freaked him out." [...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E

The major autonomy movement in Aceh, the Free Aceh Movement has the term in its name (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka), as does the major armed independence group in West Papua, the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka). Nowadays too, some conservative and Nationalists had re-thought the 'Merdeka' stance of Indonesia, many question related to it such as [...] "Apakah kita benar-benar sudah merdeka?" [...] (Had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> really independent?).
