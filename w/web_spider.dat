5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the <b>web</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia usually waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When an insect is stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the <b>web</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E

5|$|When hunting a <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> in the prey's web, a P. schultzi walks {{very slowly}} towards the prey and then, when {{two to three}} {{centimetres}} away, pauses for some minutes. During this time the P. schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays motionless. P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E

50|$|Wolf <b>spiders</b> {{resemble}} nursery <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders {{carry their}} egg sacs by attaching {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.|$|R
25|$|The {{invertebrates}} species reported are: Eunidia djiboutiana (Lamiares du Monde), longhorned beetle; Lamiares du Monde, a dung beetle, Trichonotulus secquorum; Lophothericles popovi, a grasshopper; Cryncus dmitrievi, a cricket; and Euprosthenopsis vachoni,a nursery <b>web</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bites by the redbacks (Latrodectus hasselti) number a few {{thousand}} yearly throughout the country. Antivenom use is frequent but declining. Children may have less complications of bite. Funnel <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> bites are few 30–40 per year and 10% requiring intervention. The Sydney funnel web and related species are only {{on the east coast}} of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> the male {{sometimes}} feigns death to avoid getting eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory cichlid Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to {{what appears to be a}} dead fish, whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} bites include {{clearing}} clutter {{and the use}} of pesticides. Most spider bites are managed with supportive care such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) for pain and antihistamines for itchiness. Opioids may be used if the pain is severe. While an antivenom exists for black widow spider venom, it is associated with anaphylaxis and therefore not commonly used in the United States. Antivenom against funnel <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> venom improves outcomes. Surgery may be required to repair the area of injured skin from some recluse bites.|$|E
25|$|Four species {{occur in}} New Zealand. Two are widespread: the large Dolomedes aquaticus of open riverbanks, and the similar size Dolomedes dondalei or New Zealand forest fishing spider (once {{referred}} to as Dolomedes III), which specialises in forested riverbanks. The largest of the New Zealand species Dolomedes schauinslandi or Rangatira spider occurs in the Chatham Islands, where it occurs on rodent-free islands where running water is rare. The fourth species, D. minor, is also not restricted to rivers. Known as the nursery <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> it makes white nursery webs on shrubs, but is still capable of fishing behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E
500|$|A Portia can pluck another <b>spider's</b> <b>web</b> with a {{virtually}} unlimited range of signals, either {{to lure the}} prey {{out into the open}} or calming the prey by monotonously repeating the same signal while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite it. Such tactics enable Portia species to take <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> from 10% to 200% of a Portia′s size, and Portia species hunt in all types of webs. In contrast, other cursorial spiders generally have difficulty moving on <b>webs,</b> and web-building <b>spiders</b> find it difficult to move in webs unlike those they build. When hunting in another <b>spider's</b> <b>web,</b> a Portia′s slow, choppy movements and the flaps on its legs make it resemble leaf detritus caught in the web and blown in a breeze. P. fimbriata and some other Portia species use breezes and other disturbances as [...] "smokescreens" [...] in which these predators can approach <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> more quickly, and revert to a more cautious approach when the disturbance disappears. A few <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> run far away when they sense the un-rhythmical gait of a Portia entering the web – a reaction Wilcox and Jackson call [...] "Portia panic".|$|R

500|$|A web spider's web is an {{extension}} of the web spider's senses, informing the spider of vibrations that signal the arrival of prey and predators. If the intruder is another <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> these vibrations vary widely depending on the new web spider's species, sex and experience. A Portia can pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of signals, either to lure the prey out into the open or calming the prey by monotonously repeating the same signal while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite it. Such tactics enable Portias to take web spiders from 10% to 200% of a Portia′s size, and Portias hunt in all types of webs. In contrast, other cursorial spiders generally have difficulty moving on webs, and web-building spiders find it difficult to move in webs unlike those they build: sticky webs adhere to cursorial spiders and to web-builders of non-sticky webs; builders of cribellate webs have difficulty with non-cribellate webs, and vice versa. Where the web is sparse, a Portia will use [...] "rotary probing", in which it moves a free leg around until it meets a thread. When hunting in another spider's web, a Portia′s slow, choppy movement and the flaps on its legs make it resemble leaf detritus caught in the web and blown in a breeze.

2500|$|Weta's first {{completed}} {{creature was}} the Cave Troll, and originally {{wanted to make}} the Orcs totally animalistic before the switch to prosthetics. They gave specific designs to the Moria Orcs, Uruk-hai and Mordor Orcs so as to give variety to the characters. They also spent time making creatures biologically believable, rooting them sometimes in real creatures: Shelob's body is a funnel <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> and the Wargs are a bear/hyena/wolf hybrid. Howe lent himself for Beswarick to study when shaping Gollum, and he also took inspiration from Iggy Pop due to his skin-muscle ratio. Whilst most creatures were destined to exist in the computer, Weta did create a 14 feet tall Treebeard puppet (which needed 5 people to operate), a single dead mûmak and later on, a [...] "Phoney Pony" [...] for close-up shots of riding actors. Designing continued throughout production, such as Gollum's redesign in May 2001 and the Great Beasts in early 2003.|$|E
