Features grouping Didi with Columbidae were {{the angle of}} the mandible and the hook {{at the end of the}} beak.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{for what}} would become SR 125 north of I-8 began in 1954. Route 282 <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> route from Brown Field through La Mesa {{extending}} to Route 277 in 1959, and in 1961 the latter terminus was changed to Route 278. The California Highway Commission selected a route for the highway in mid-1963. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 125 was designated as the highway from SR 75 near Brown Field to SR 56. Route198 was renumbered as State Route67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.|$|E
5|$|South African {{paleontologist}} Robert Broom {{created the}} name Geranosaurus in 1911 for dinosaur jaw bones missing {{all of the}} teeth. In 1924, Lycorhinus was named, and classified as a cynodont, by Sidney Haughton. Heterodontosaurus was named in 1962 and it, Lycorhinus and Geranosaurus were recognized as closely related ornithischian dinosaurs. Alfred Romer named Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus. It <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clade in 1998 by Paul Sereno and redefined by him in 2005 as the stem clade consisting of Heterodontosaurus tucki and all species {{more closely related to}} Heterodontosaurus than to Parasaurolophus walkeri, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Triceratops horridus, or Ankylosaurus magniventris.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK and Australia, {{susceptibility}} <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minimum {{inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) of 0.25mg/l or 0.5mg/l or less. [...] Resistance <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> MIC of 2mg/l or more. [...] In laboratories using disc diffusion methods, susceptibility for <b>a</b> 2.5µg disc <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zone of 22mm or more, and resistance <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zone of 17mm or less; intermediate values <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> intermediate resistance. [...] These susceptibility criteria are based on lower dosing regimens used outside of the U.S. [...] Clinical trials in the U.S. incorporate a different dosing regimen that results in higher blood levels. [...] Therefore, the U.S. dosing regimen may warrant different susceptibility criteria.|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> step 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5. In 2006 the Regional League was re-graded by the Football Association as a step 6 league.

5|$|Omaha {{arrived at}} Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with Odenwald flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. It {{was not until}} 30 April 1947, that a case was brought by Odenwalds owners in the District Court for Puerto Rico, against the US. Their claim stated that because {{a state of war}} between the United States and Germany did not exist at the time of capture the vessel could not be taken as a prize or bounty. The court however, given the fact that Odenwald was rescued from sinking by the US crew, {{declared}} that the seizing of the ship <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal salvage operation. The US was awarded the profits that were made from Odenwald and her cargo. All the men of the original boarding party received $3,000 each, {{while the rest of the}} crewmen in Omaha and Somers, at the time, were entitled to two months' pay and allowances. The laws have since been revised, making this the last time that US Navy members received such an award.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors. With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, however, the clade has received several more explicit definitions. The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998, where Tyrannosauroidea <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stem-based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with Tyrannosaurus rex than with neornithean birds. To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a new definition in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers. The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review.|$|E

25|$|Bradycardia <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{heart rate}} less than 60 {{beats per minute}} when {{textbooks}} asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. Bradycardia {{may be associated with}} medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.|$|E

It was not intended for correctness verification for techniques (e.g. OT) that are designed for specific data and operation models and for specific applications. In, the notion of intention preservation was defined and refined at three levels: First, it <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> generic consistency requirement for collaborative editing systems; Second, it was defined as operation context-based pre- and post- transformation conditions for generic OT functions; Third, it was defined as specific operation verification criteria to guide the design of OT functions for two primitive operations: string-wise insert and delete, in collaborative plain text editors.|$|E
25|$|The border <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{march in}} a treaty in 1326 and {{separated}} which {{parts of the}} Sami could be taxed by Norway and Russia. The border line was defined by a treaty in 1826 and essentially remains the same border today. In 1920 Petsamo was ceded to Finland and the border {{became part of the}} Finland–Norway border. Petsamo was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944 and the Norway–Soviet Union border was established. During the Cold War, the border was one of two between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Soviet Union, the other being the Soviet Union–Turkey border. From 1991 to 1999 it was the only border between Russia and NATO. It is Norway's youngest unchanged border. Since the 1960s there has been disagreement as to the border between the two countries' EEZs, but this was resolved by a delimitation agreement in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Glanmor School (correctly Glanmôr) was a {{secondary}} school in Swansea in south Wales, founded as Glanmor Central School {{for boys and}} girls in 1922 and closed by merger with Bishop Gore Comprehensive School for Boys in 1972. It was situated on Glanmor Hill in Uplands in wooden ex-army buildings. It had a status between secondary and elementary until 1930, when it <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secondary school. The buildings were requisitioned for the US army during the Second World War, and the boys' school closed in 1941. The girls' school continued as a grammar school until 1972. When the presence of high alumina cement in support structures of other Swansea schools caused their closure in 1974, its buildings were re-used by Olchfa Comprehensive School for two years. The site was cleared in August 1989 and replaced with housing, with the new streets named after some of the school's houses.|$|E
