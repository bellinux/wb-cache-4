40|$|Abstract: The {{unsteady}} {{water discharge}} rate on performance of storage-type domestic electrical water-heaters with wedged inlet was studied by computer fluid dynamics simulation (CFD). The results {{were compared with}} those of conventional design EWHs having the same tank size. The heater performance is characterized the discharge efficiency, extraction efficiency and fraction of heat recoverable. The <b>water</b> <b>draw-off</b> temperature profile of steady and unsteady water discharge rate has nothing difference for wedged inlet structure, both curve was overlapped. The almost the same energy utility efficiency was gotten both steady and unsteady discharge rate for wedged inlet structure. The obviously difference of <b>water</b> <b>draw-off</b> temperature profile was shown for conventional inlet structure. <b>Water</b> <b>draw-off</b> temperature profile of unsteady discharge rate was decreased faster than steady discharge rate. The energy utility efficiency of unsteady discharge rate was also lower than steady discharge rate. The results were shown that the wedged inlet structure heater has excellent performance for energy utility efficiency under unsteady discharge rate...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to present {{the results of the}} testing of a small scale hybrid sensible/latent storage system (nominal volume 48. 6 dm 3), {{consisting}} of water in which macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) are added. Two different PCMs were macro-encapsulated, a commercial paraffin and a hydrate salts mixture prepared in the CNR ITAE lab, and loaded inside the tank in order to be tested. Different volume ratios between the PCM and the water were tested. The tests were conducted simulating different domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>draw-off</b> profiles. The resulting data showed an appreciable increase of heat storage capacity per unit of volume, even for limited fractions of PCM employed, reaching up to 10 % of heat storage increasing by 1. 3 dm 3 of hydrate salts mixture added. Finally, the experimental results were used to test a numerical method of a PCM enhanced tank for dynamic plant simulations in ESP-r environment...|$|E
40|$|An {{implementation}} of the genetic algorithm in a design support tool for (large) solar hot water systems is described. The tool calculates the yield {{and the costs of}} solar hot water systems based on technical and financial data of the system components. The genetic algorithm allows for optimisation of separate variables such as the collector type, the number of collectors, the heat storage mass and the collector heat exchanger area. Optimisation can be focussed on, for example, payback time and CO 2 emission reduction. Constraints such as maximum initial costs and installation space are taken into account. The applicability of the genetic algorithm was tested for optimisation of large solar hot water systems. Among others, the sensitivity of the optimum system design to the tap <b>water</b> <b>draw-off</b> and the draw-off pattern has been determined using the optimisation algorithm. As the genetic algorithm is a discrete optimisation tool and is implemented in the design tool through the use of databases, the number of variables in principle is free of choice. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a solar water heating system with 4 m 2 flat plate collectors in Dublin, Ireland is presented in this paper. The experimental setup consisted of a commercially available forced circulation domestic scale system fitted with an automated sub‐system that controlled hot <b>water</b> <b>draw‐offs</b> and the operation of an auxiliary immersion heater. The system was tested over a year and the maximum recorded collector outlet fluid temperature was 70. 4 oC while the maximum water temperature {{at the bottom of}} the hot water tank was 59. 9 oC. The annual average daily energy collected was 19. 6 MJ/d, energy delivered by the solar coil was 16. 2 MJ/d, supply pipe loss was 3. 2 MJ/d, solar fraction was 32. 2 %, collector efficiency was 45. 6 % and system efficiency was 37. 8 %. Supply pipe losses represented 16. 4 % of energy collected...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the thermal performance of a solar water heating system with heat pipe evacuated tube collector using data obtained from a field trial installation over a year in Dublin, Ireland. An automated sub‐system was developed and incorporated to control the hot <b>water</b> <b>draw‐offs</b> and electric immersion heater to mimic the operation of solar water heating systems in domestic dwellings. The maximum recorded collector outlet fluid temperature was 70. 3 oC while the water temperature {{at the bottom of the}} hot water tank was 59. 5 oC. The annual average daily energy collected was 20. 4 MJd‐ 1, energy delivered by the solar coil was 16. 8 MJd‐ 1, supply pipe loss was 3. 6 MJd‐ 1, solar fraction was 33. 8 %, collector efficiency was 63. 2 % and system efficiency was 52. 0 %. Reducing the supply pipe losses which represented 17. 7 % of energy collected and 21. 5 % of energy delivered to the hot water tank, and developing a better pump control strategy for heavily overcast and intermittent cloud covered days could result in system improvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tank-interconnection {{geometry}} on temperature stratification {{in an integrated}} collector-storage solar water (ICSSW) heater with two horizontal cylindrical tanks has been studied. The tanks were parallel to each other, and separated horizontally and vertically, with the lower tank fitted directly below a glass cover, {{and half of the}} upper tank insulated. In addition, a truncated parabolic concentrator was fitted below the tanks, with its focal line along the axis of the upper tank. The heater was tested outdoors with the two tanks connected in parallel (P), and S 1 -and S 2 -series configurations, with and without hot <b>water</b> <b>draw-off.</b> Water temperature was monitored during solar collection and hot water draw-offs. For the heat charging process, it was found that only the lower tank exhibited temperature stratification in the P-and S 1 -tank modes of operation. There was satisfactory temperature stratification in both tanks in the S 2 -tank configuration. For the hot water draining process, the P-tank configuration exhibited some degree of stratification in both tanks. A significant loss of stratification was observed in the lower tank, with the upper tank exhibiting practical stratification, when the system was operated in the S 1 -tank mode. The S 2 -tank interconnection maintained a satisfactory degree of temperature stratification in both tanks. So, the S 2 -tank mode of operation was most effective in promoting practical temperature stratification in both tanks during solar collection and hot water draw-offs. Other results are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|To make Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) commercially {{competitive}} as dwellings {{the energy}} supply and on-site generation {{has to be}} thoroughly planned. The optimal mix of energy sources depend on the demand profiles for the building. Detailed load calculation for HVAC installation is implemented in many building energy simulation software whereas the main user dependent loads are greatly simplified. In this assignment models for generating stochastic and statistical representative user profiles for Norwegian households have been made. The work {{is a continuation of}} the literature study where a methodology of Richardson et al. was recommended for further work. This model uses national time of use survey data (TUD) which have some discrepancies compared to Norwegian TUD. The objective has been to adjust Richardson's model with Norwegian data and assess the validity of the generated user profiles. Thereby determine if the Norwegian TUD can be used despite the discrepancies with the existing simulation methodology. Four models have been made generating data for occupancy and electricity demand for lighting, non-HVAC appliances and water heater (DESWH). The generated profiles have 10 -minute resolution for the occupancy model and 1 -minute for the other three. With limited access to measured data only superficial validations of the output could be made. From the comparison it is found that the generated demand profiles for lighting and appliances can be used in building simulation software if calibrated separately for each household size. The occupancy is considerably underestimated in the model and the profile for DESWH should be based on more detailed TUD. No model have been made for domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>draw-off</b> events because too little data was available for both adjusting the model input and validating the output. Without more data the existing model of Wid&# 233;n or Jordan and Vajen is recommended to use as is. </p...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss <b>water</b> and the <b>draw-off</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
