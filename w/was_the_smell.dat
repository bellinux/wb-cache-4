5|$|The {{overwhelming}} sensation {{about the}} neighborhood <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> {{of the community}} caused not just by the packing plants located immediately to the east, {{but also by the}} 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|Just after midnight, German small-arms fire began {{along the}} fronts of the 73rd and 72nd brigades, in the centre and {{left of the}} 24th Division and the 76th Brigade on the right flank of the 3rd Division. Soon after, a gas {{discharge}} began on a [...] from La Petite Douve Farm to Spanbroekmolen. (In German reports of the operation, the gas was said to rise above head-height and was illuminated by British flares. British return-fire began and after five minutes, artillery-fire commenced.) Along most of the line, German rifle and machine-gun fire blanketed the hiss of gas and smothered the sound of alarm gongs and klaxons. The first warning for many British soldiers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell,</b> since with the wind speed and no man's land being only [...] wide in places, the gas arrived without warning. The British donned their helmets and a volley of Very lights revealed the gas cloud. German artillery began a bombardment behind the British front, on artillery positions, observation posts, support trenches and strong points. The gas signal reached the divisional HQs at [...] and three minutes later, the artillery of the 24th and 50th divisions, behind Hill 63 and the Vierstraat spur and the corps heavy artillery, began to bombard their night lines.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} has <b>been</b> advanced for <b>the</b> presence of <b>the</b> unusual <b>smells.</b> They {{could possibly have}} resulted from the burning or smouldering (but not detonation) of the bombs' explosives, or they could have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>smell</b> of <b>the</b> explosive.

60|$|The air {{was soft}} and grey and mild and evening was coming.

60|$|When Whopper got outside again, {{followed}} by Shep, {{he saw the}} wolves had approached still closer.

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of carrion, of putrifying flesh, and of {{that old}} and ever-newly {{moistened}} crust of dust and coagulated blood.

60|$|Whether it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of {{the cheese}} or the ketchup we know not, but here better {{thoughts}} came over our hero.

Possibly the sugar, if not the cinnamon, {{may have been an}} element in his change of mind. At all events {{it is safe to say}} that the general smell of groceries was associated with it.|$|E
60|$|A tree, {{contracting}} in {{the cool}} of the night, made a loud noise. It was directly above him. He yelped in his fright. A panic seized him, and he ran madly toward the village. He knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man. In his nostrils <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the camp-smoke. In his ears the camp-sounds and cries were ringing loud. He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses. But no village greeted his eyes. He had forgotten. The village had gone away.|$|E
60|$|My courage failed that evening. I {{spent it}} at the {{coastguard}} station, where they gave me bread and cheese and some awful cider. I passed the kitchen as I came back.

They were Pasiance and Mrs. Hopgood; and so charming <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of eggs and bacon, and they had such an air of tender enjoyment of this dark revel, that I stifled many pangs, as I crept hungry up to bed.|$|E

6000|$|Yusuf's {{little room}} was very hot. The dust had blown in, {{and the floor}} was gritty. Flies hovered about the copper lamp which burned an {{aromatic}} oil. The agent gave Kit coffee and a cigarette. The tobacco was bitter but soothing and Kit imagined it was mixed with an Eastern drug. At Yusuf's he generally felt dull; perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the lamp, leather and spices.
