5|$|Persian satraps (and presumably their armies) <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> travel {{west of the}} Halys River (Isocrates) or {{closer than}} a day's journey on horseback to the Aegean Sea (Callisthenes) or closer than three days' journey on foot to the Aegean Sea (Ephorus and Diodorus).|$|E

5|$|According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his {{distaste for}} Christmas, {{birthday}} parties and other popular customs that {{were described as}} of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> win the League or the FA Cup {{for another}} 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, {{and the club}} failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were {{competitive}} during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club {{spent most of the}} 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E

60|$|Law {{is either}} archic[107] (of direction), meristic (of division), or critic (of judgment). Archic law {{is that of}} {{appointment}} and precept: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Meristic law is that of balance and distribution: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possessed. Critic law is that of discernment and award: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suffered.|$|R

5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be considered real artists.|$|E
5|$|Holm (1992) {{considers}} Egil's saga {{to equate}} the Kylfings with the Finnic Karelians. In the 14th century, when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in Norrbotten, there were regulations that the Birkarls and the Saami peoples <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be interrupted in their traditional activities. A {{large part of the}} Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called Kylfingaland, and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|In 1594, Albert Frederick's then 14-year-old {{daughter}} Anna {{married the}} son of Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, John Sigismund. The marriage ensured the right of succession in the Prussian duchy {{as well as in}} Cleves. Upon George Frederick's death in 1603, the regency of the Prussian duchy passed to Joachim Frederick. Also in 1603, the Treaty of Gera was concluded by the members of the House of Hohenzollern, ruling that their territories <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be internally divided in the future.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organising Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in parallel to the Games. The Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be added to the}} official medal tally since Wushu was not on the programme of the 2008 Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
