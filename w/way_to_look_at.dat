25|$|Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{punishment}} in cotton-top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses {{within and between}} groups, {{as well as between}} species. The cotton-top tamarin, like many marmosets, other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves {{in parts of the}} Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

500|$|Nitsche and Lowood {{describe}} {{two methods}} of approaching machinima: starting from {{a video game}} and seeking a medium for expression or for documenting gameplay ("inside-out"), and starting outside a game and using it merely as animation tool ("outside-in"). Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd similarly distinguish between works that retain noticeable connections to games, and those closer to traditional animation. Belonging to the former category, gameplay and stunt machinima began in 1997 with Quake done Quick. Although not the first speedrunners, its creators used external software to manipulate camera positions after recording, which, according to Lowood, elevated speedrunning [...] "from cyberathleticism to making movies". Stunt machinima remains popular. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that [...] stunt videos offer a new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the game, and compare Battlefield 1942 machinima creators to the Harlem Globetrotters. Built-in features for video editing and post-recording camera positioning in Halo 3 were expected to facilitate gameplay-based machinima. MMORPGs and other virtual worlds have been captured in documentary films, such as Miss Galaxies 2004, a beauty pageant {{that took place in}} the virtual world of Star Wars Galaxies.

2500|$|Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> President Obama's tenure is as a slow {{recovery}} from a combined financial crisis and recession. Research indicates such recoveries can be protracted, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth. Economist Carmen Reinhart stated in August 2011: [...] "Debt de-leveraging [...] takes about seven years...And {{in the decade}} following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, {{and not all of}} that growth was real.

[...] This form of meditation is one in which the meditator becomes concentrated and focuses on the absence or presence of disturbances in their mind, if they find a disturbance they notice it and allow it drop away, this leads to deeper states of calmness. Emptiness is also seen as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> sense experience that does not identify with the [...] "I-making" [...] and [...] "my-making" [...] process of the mind.
