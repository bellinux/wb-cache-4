40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor (Polychaeta: Nereididae) {{revealed}} a marked genetic fragmentation across its distribution and the occurrence of sibling taxa in the Baltic Sea. These results suggested that the phylogeographic patterns of H. diversicolor could reflect interactions between cryptic differentiation and multiple colonization events. This study aims to describe the large-scale genetic structuring of H. diversicolor and to trace the phylogeographic origins of the genetic types described in the Baltic Sea. Samples of H. diversicolor (2 < n < 28) were collected at 16 locations across the NE Atlantic coasts of Europe and Morocco and in the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas and sequenced at two mitochondrial gene fragments (COI and cytb, 345 and 290 bp, respectively). Bayesian analyses revealed deep phylogeographic splits yielding three main clades corresponding to populations (i) from the NE Atlantic coasts (from Germany to Morocco) and from part of the <b>Western</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> (ii) from the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Sea,</b> and (iii) from the Black and Caspian Seas. These clades are further divided in well-supported subclades including populations from different regions of NE Atlantic and Mediterranean (i. e.

40|$|Population {{structuring}} {{in species}} inhabiting marine environments {{such as the}} Northeast Atlantic Ocean (NEA) and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Sea</b> (MS) has usually been explained based on past and present physical barriers to gene flow and isolation by distance (IBD). Here, we examined {{the relative importance of}} these factors on population structuring of the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis by using methods of phylogenetic inference and hypothesis testing coupled with coalescent and classical population genetic parameter estimation. Individuals from 10 Atlantic and 15 Mediterranean sites were sequenced for 659 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene (259 sequences). IBD seems to be the main factor driving present and past genetic structuring of Sepia populations across the NEA-MS, both at large and small geographical scales. Such an evolutionary process agrees well with some of the biological features characterizing this cuttlefish species (short migrations, nektobenthic habit, benthic eggs hatching directly to benthic juveniles). Despite the many barriers to migration/gene flow suggested in the NEA-MS region, genetic population fragmentation due to past isolation of water masses (Pleistocene; 0. 56 million years ago) and/or present-day oceanographic currents was only detected between the Aegean-Ionian and <b>western</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Seas.</b> Restricted gene flow associated with the Almeria-Oran hydrographic front was also suggested between southern and eastern Spanish populations. Distinct population boundaries could not be clearly determined, except for the Aegean-Ionian stock.
