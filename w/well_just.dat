5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as <b>well,</b> <b>just</b> like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, {{he worked for}} the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live <b>well</b> <b>just</b> from the interest from his savings.|$|E

At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.

NY40 and NY142 become concurrent for one block in front of the Lansingburgh Reservoir, before NY40 turns northward once again.

25|$|On May 14, 1861 while Col. Dimick {{was still}} {{in command of the}} garrison, he seized a <b>well</b> <b>just</b> outside the fort in what was then Elizabeth City County because the fort did not have enough water even for its {{original}} small garrison. His forces also occupied the Mill Creek Bridge, which was needed for access to the Peninsula from the fort and the nearby Clark farm. The fort soon could not hold all of the arriving reinforcements so Union forces established Camp Troy, soon renamed Camp Hamilton in honor of an aide to General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, on the Segar farm on the Hampton side of Mill Creek, within range of the guns of Fort Monroe.|$|E
25|$|As the {{language}} of the ruling ethnicity, some type of Nubian dialect would have been the most important language. Just like in Makuria, this language was written in a variant of the Coptic alphabet. However, while this topic is still understudied it seems that there were differences between the Old Nubian and Alodian alphabet. Erman, who studied several Alodian inscriptions, suggested that the Alodian script had five unique letters, while Monneret states that it had six. The latter also assumes that those derived from Meroitic letters. The fact that Alodia used its own dialect for writing and even developed new letters for it differs it from Makuria, where the spoken language, Old Dongolawi, was never put into writing. Except of Nubian, Greek played an important role as <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> as it was for Alodia's northern cousin, Greek was probably a very prestigious language, used predominantly for liturgy and other religious matters. Both is spectaculary proven by the tomb stone of king David, which was written in surprisingly accurate Greek. Due to the sparse sources it's not possible to say much definite about the niveau of the Greek language among the common people. Perhaps one can draw parallels to Makuria though: There the niveau decayed over the centuries, leading to a hybrid language with a mixture of Greek and Nubian words, structured into one sentence after Nubian grammar rules. Coptic, as a language of communication with Christian Egypt, was only of limited relevance due to geographic reasons, but nevertheless do sparse written remains exist.|$|E

500|$|The {{level of}} dramaticism {{of some of}} the character's storylines, {{as well as those of}} other Holby City nurses was heavily criticised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The lead article of the July 2007 issue of the NMC {{magazine}} tackled nurses in popular culture, discussing [...] "the ease with which writers can attach terrible storylines to a caring profession", and stating: [...] "Nurses who become prostitutes to pay the bills, nurses who kill their husbands, nurses who abuse the system to get their own way - Holby City has always been a hotbed of slanderous storylines. Good people doing bad things makes excellent entertainment... The bald fact is that real life nurses doing their jobs <b>well</b> <b>just</b> aren't that entertaining." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as <b>well,</b> <b>just</b> that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end."

500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For all we know, Connotations is a masterpiece. But one thing is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very <b>well</b> (<b>just</b> great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E
