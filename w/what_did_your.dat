500|$|In June 2009, Noreen was {{harvesting}} falsa berries with a {{group of}} other farmhands in a field in Sheikhupura. She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well. A neighbor of Noreen, who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen's family about some property damage, saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden for a Christian to drink [...] water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink, {{and some of the other}} workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian. Some arguments ensued. Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements about her religion, she responded, [...] "I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, yes; {{not strong}} enough to fight against the abomination of a Jew son-in-law. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> aunt say? She is strong enough to fight anybody." ...|$|E

6000|$|Winterborne was too {{straightforward}} {{to influence}} her further against her better judgment. [...] "Yes--I suppose it is," [...] he said, repentantly. [...] "I'll wait till all is settled. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> father say in that last letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{think he}} can. I know that men do. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> hero Waverley {{do with his}} heart in that grand English novel which you gave me to read? I am not Flora Mac Ivor, but you may find a Rose Bradwardine." ...|$|E

6000|$|Slats, {{who wanted}} to be a lady killer, would say: [...] "Wal, Button, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> school marm say about me today?" [...] And Hookey would make fun of Pilldarlick, which ridicule had more power to hurt Pan than {{anything}} else. One day Pan gave way to fury, and with flying rocks he chased Hookey into the cellar, and every time Hookey poked up his head Pan would fling a stone with menacing accuracy. That time his mother came to the rescue of the cowboy. After that Hookey bought a new saddle and gave Pan his old one. That settled hostilities. Pan had a change of heart. No matter how Hookey teased or tormented him he could never again make him angry. Pan saw Hookey with different eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak," [...] {{said his}} audience, with great anxiety. [...] "Have you seen? Have you heard? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>your</b> Snake tell you of me? Of me? Of me? Of me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jack is supremely pitiable," [...] he remarked; [...] "but Jack {{is also a}} {{smoldering}} volcano--and smoldering volcanos {{burst into}} eruption when {{the laws of nature}} compel them. My only hope is in Mr. Superintendent. Surely he will not let this madman loose on us, with nobody but your aunt to hold the chain? What did she really say, when you left Jack, and had your private talk in the reception-room? One minute, my friend, before you begin," [...] said Fritz, groping under the bench upon which we were seated. [...] "I had a second presentiment that we might want a second bottle--and here it is! Fill your glass; and let us establish ourselves in our respective positions--you to administer, and I to sustain, a severe shock to the moral sense. I think, David, this second bottle is even more deliciously brisk than the first. Well, and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> aunt say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear me out, George; {{look at it}} from {{my point}} of view, as well as your own. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> cousin Noel do? Your cousin Noel fell a victim, poor fellow, to one of the vilest conspiracies I ever heard of, and the prime mover of that {{conspiracy}} was Miss Vanstone's damnable sister. She deceived him in the most infamous manner; and as soon as she was down for a handsome legacy in his will, she had the poison ready to take his life. This is the truth; we know it from Mrs. Lecount, who found the bottle locked up in her own room. If you marry Miss Vanstone, you make this wretch your sister-in-law. She becomes a member of our family. All the disgrace of what she has done; all the disgrace of what she may do--and the Devil, who possesses her, only knows what lengths she may go to next--becomes our disgrace. Good heavens, George, consider what a position that is! Consider what pitch you touch, if you make this woman your sister-in-law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once more, Belle, I beg you to consider. Do {{you know}} what kind of man this is for whom you are giving up your life? Not only has he deserted you, but do you know how he has got hold of Ida de la Molle? He has, as I know well, /bought/ her. I tell you he has bought her as much as though he had gone into the open market and paid down a price for her. The other day Cossey and Son were going to foreclose upon the Honham estates, which would have ruined the old gentleman. Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> young man do? He went to the girl--who hates him, by the way, and is in love with Colonel Quaritch--and said to her, 'If you will promise to marry me when I ask you, I will find the thirty {{thousand}} pounds and take up the mortgages.' And on those terms she agreed to marry him. And now he has got rid of you and he claims her promise. There is the history. I wonder that your pride will bear such a thing. By heaven, I would kill the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arrest you? I?" [...] exclaimed the man. [...] "For <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>your</b> Highness take me? Why, sir, I {{make sure}} there is not a man in Grünewald would lay hands upon you." ...|$|R

5000|$|... [...] "So," [...] {{he said as}} {{the dishes}} were cleared away. [...] "Now that {{everything}} is settled, I'm curious: <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> father do?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In October 2000 he criticised {{collective}} amnesia in Serbia in a New Statesman essay entitled <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>your</b> dad do for Milošević?.

He contributed a chapter, Missing the Target and Spurning the Prize to the book, The Phone Hacking Scandal: Journalism on Trial (Arima Publishing, 2012) This chapter {{formed the basis of}} his submission to the Leveson Inquiry. In March 2014 he co-authored an essay, [...] "Good Behaviour Can be Taught" [...] in British Journalism Review in which he argued that ethical training, not state sanctioned regulation, is the most appropriate way to promote quality journalism in a democratic society.|$|E
