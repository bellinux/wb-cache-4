5|$|The first {{official}} communications between Western Europe and the Mongol Empire occurred between Pope Innocent IV (fl. 1243–1254) and the Great Khans, via letters and envoys that were sent overland and {{could take years}} to arrive at their destination. The communications initiated {{what was to become}} a regular pattern in European–Mongol communications: the Europeans <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Mongols to convert to Christianity, and the Mongols would respond with demands for submission.|$|E
25|$|The process {{began when}} the Street Commissioner {{recommended}} to the Common Council that a certain street, or part of a street, be opened, and the Council <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> New York State Supreme Court to appoint a Commission of Estimate and Assessment, as described below.|$|E

25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.|$|E
25|$|In {{a written}} statement, Geithner said that China is {{manipulating}} the Renminbi by purposefully keeping its value low {{in order to}} make its exported products seem cheaper on the world market. If confirmed, Geither said to the Senate Finance Committee that he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Obama administration to pressure China diplomatically to change this practice, more strongly than the Bush administration did. The United States maintains that China's actions hurt American businesses and contributed to the financial crisis.|$|E

25|$|The person {{responsible}} for filling the ab anbars (both private and public) was someone called a meerab. In effect, {{he was responsible for}} distributing the kariz network at various times. If a house wanted its ab anbar filled, they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> meerab to open up the kariz to their ab anbar. An overnight appointment would be enough to fill a typical house ab anbar. The ab anbar would also have to be cleaned once a year from settled sediments.|$|E
25|$|Several anti-Syrian Lebanese {{politicians}} blamed Syria. However, Syrian authorities denied complicity {{and stated}} that the crime was aimed at directing fresh accusations against Syria. Commentators stressed that the explosion occurred {{only a few hours}} before the UN investigating commission was due to submit an update of its report on the Hariri assassination to then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In response, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora announced that he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Security Council to investigate Syrian complicity in the deaths of Tueni and other prominent anti-Syrian figures.|$|E
25|$|The last {{eleven years}} of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, {{including}} a self-imposed vow of near-silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging {{his life and}} acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. She <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those who could gained admittance, {{those who could not}} were shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound was not easy; yet, her belief in him was absolute.|$|E

25|$|Teoh {{was engaged}} to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two-year courtship, and had been {{planning}} to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child. National Registration Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the birth certificate if he is physically present {{at the time of}} birth; after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school to one closer to her hometown, and look into assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner.|$|E
25|$|On 20 March, council leader Hilda Kean {{declared}} that the council would be bankrupt {{by the middle of}} April if unable to set a rate and abjured the use of creative accounting to evade the cap. The council slightly softened its policy on 28 March, declaring that it was only deferring making a rate and committing to making a legal rate in due course; a motion to stick to the previous formula was defeated by 32 to 24. The council having ignored the High Court's interlocutory declaration, Mourad Fleming's judicial review application proceeded to trial on 1 April; Fleming agreed to vary an order and let the council use borrowing powers in the 1985/86 financial year, but said that he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> court to appoint a receiver to run the council if no rate was set. At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Woolf found both Hackney's resolutions of 7 and 28 March unlawful and quashed them but refused to immediately order the council to set a rate. Instead he adjourned the case to 16 April.|$|E
500|$|Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Wouter Bos phoned Schuringa {{on behalf}} of the Dutch {{government}} the day after the attack, and conveyed the government's compliments and gratitude for Schuringa's part in overpowering the suspect.

500|$|Weinberg was {{subsequently}} appointed director in 1955. He often {{sat in the}} front row at ORNL division information meetings and he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> first, often very penetrating, question after each scientific talk.

When asked how he found the time to attend every meeting, Weinberg replied jokingly, [...] "We didn't have a DOE in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|At her formal {{campaign}} launch on 4 October, Independent Mary Davis accused Fine Gael {{of using}} polling companies to research attacks on her. She also pledged she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Government {{to bring the}} office of President {{under the terms of}} the Freedom of Information Act and that she would publish an annual expenditure report for the Áras. David Norris also made a pledge to publish expenses. Mrs. Davis eventually accepted [...] "collective responsibility" [...] for mortgage lending decisions made after she was appointed to the board of the ICS building society.|$|E
500|$|Paul Birchard {{was cast}} as Libby McCall because the {{producers}} believed he {{acted like a}} [...] "dinosaur" [...] from the former Bush administration. Child actor Luke Tzortzis was cast as Nico since they were impressed with his intelligence and the fact he is a [...] "strong" [...] actor; children are often hard to work with in the series, but in Tzortzis' case, he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> production crew several questions between takes {{in order to do}} understand what he is to do in the episode.

500|$|A popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid {{after her}} death, {{living in the}} Aegean. She <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> sailors on any ship she would {{encounter}} only one question: [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] ( [...] ;"), to which the correct answer was: [...] "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" [...] (Greek: [...] "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει"). [...] This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. [...] Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.|$|E
500|$|The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April {{that would}} {{form the basis}} for the 1911 Parliament Act: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have {{preferred}} four). But in that debate Asquith hinted – to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs – that he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> King to break the deadlock [...] "in that Parliament" [...] (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} all-rounder of his era, Wills {{saw himself}} principally as a bowler. With a repertoire that included [...] "sparklers, rippers, fizzers, trimmers and shooters", he varied his pace and style considerably, and {{was quick to}} work out a batsman's weak points. Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight and big on break, Wills' fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. English batsman Sir David Serjeant said that Wills was the only bowler he ever feared. He was known to carefully study an umpire before deciding whether to throw. A trickster, he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> umpire to watch his feet lest he go over the crease, and then [...] "let go a throw for all he was worth". His most flagrant throws were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.|$|E
