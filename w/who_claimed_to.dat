5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was {{the best}} known of several impostors <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> {{have invented}} a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he {{applied to the}} government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have reached the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Budge was {{approached}} by a resident of Gebelein <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have found more mummies. Budge {{was taken to the}} bodies, and he immediately recognized them as from the predynastic period and the first complete pre-dynastic bodies identified. He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (Waterless River) located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett {{notes the}} irony of the surf music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 1846, {{the party}} left Blacks Fork {{after four days}} of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a {{replacement}} driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain {{on the way to}} California.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> be of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various {{pieces that}} reflect an enthusiasm for those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and {{are inspired by}} Busoni's Elegy No. 2, All'Italia, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Liszt. They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E

5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing {{the details of the}} creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> {{have received a}} faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that {{there might have been}} survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E

That year most former AFL elements were concentrated at Camp Schiefflin.
