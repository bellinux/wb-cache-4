40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the decidability {{and complexity of}} problems related to braid composition. While all known problems for a class of braids with 3 strands, B 3, have polynomial time solutions we prove that a very natural question <b>for</b> <b>braid</b> composition, the membership problem, is NP-hard <b>for</b> <b>braids</b> with only 3 strands. The membership problem is decidable for B 3, but it becomes harder for a class of braids with more strands. In particular we show that fundamental problems about braid compositions are undecidable <b>for</b> <b>braids</b> with at least 5 strands, but decidability of these problems for B 4 remains open. The paper introduce a few challenging algorithmic problems about topological braids opening new connections between braid groups, combinatorics on words, complexity theory and provides solutions {{for some of these}} problems by application of several techniques from automata theory, matrix semigroups and algorithms...|$|R

It also provides a new presentation <b>for</b> <b>braid</b> groups; the conjugation by a Coxeter element is a “diagram automorphism ” of the new presentation.
