5|$|Dickens <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> {{the lot of}} poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E

5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the {{direction}} of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E
5|$|While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, {{chaos and}} Jr. are {{attacked}} by U-TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence {{for the deaths}} of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by Albedo, who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by Albedo activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. {{and the rest of the}} group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals himself to have been part of an experiment by Dmitri Yuriev: Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U-DO. The three were close, but Albedo became disturbed when he discovered his ability to survive any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U-DO, resulting in everyone except himself, Albedo and Gaignun being killed. Albedo <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> U-DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, Albedo hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, Albedo opens the way to Miltia.|$|E

Blaga offered his irate and politically-tinged reply in Timpul newspaper; a duel between the two writers was narrowly avoided.|$|E

25|$|Kabir {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence {{when he took a}} second-innings 5–48 (and eight wickets in the match) against the touring Zimbabwe side in May 2003; in a precursor to his final-over heroics at Bloemfontein, Kabir claimed the final two wickets with the scores level to tie the match. Kabir's life <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> tragedy in July 2003, when his two-week-old nephew died. However, his father wished him to play for Worcestershire against Derbyshire a few days later, and he put in a magnificent display. After a quiet first innings with the ball, he scored a quickfire 68, putting on 104 with Steve Rhodes for the eighth wicket to help rescue his team from deep trouble at 190/7, and then ripped through the Derbyshire batting line-up to take 8–53, at the time the best innings analysis of his career. Thanks to Kabir's heroics, Worcestershire won the game by an innings. Kabir further demonstrated his batting credentials in September 2003, hitting 92 from 93 balls in a 45-over National Cricket League match against Essex, his maiden limited-overs fifty.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{traveled}} to Buffalo for their regular season finale, needing a win and help {{from either the}} Dolphins or Ravens to make the postseason. With winds gusting over 50mph, the Patriots elected to defend a goal after winning the opening coin toss. After receiving the opening kickoff, the Bills, who were without injured starting running back Marshawn Lynch ran six times with Fred Jackson and Xavier Omon before punting; Moorman's punt traveled 13 yards. Starting from their own 49-yard line, the Patriots ran with Morris and Jordan before also punting. McKelvin muffed the punt, which <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> Slater, who could not secure the ball, just before rolling {{into the end zone}} for a touchback. The Bills' next possession was a three-and-out, and this time Moorman's punt went 35 yards to the Patriots' 37-yard line. The game's first pass came two plays later, when Evans caught a pass in the flat and gained 19 yards. Cassel's second pass a few plays later was good again to Evans for 12 yards, but his third, on 3rd-and-4 from the Bills' 15-yard line was incomplete to Welker. Gostkowski then kicked a 33-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3–0 lead.|$|E

500|$|In May 1968, John Lennon and {{his wife}} Cynthia Lennon {{separated}} after John's affair with Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and John's son, Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia {{had been part of}} the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it [...] "a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life." [...] Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Funny Lady soundtrack earlier in 1975, Streisand began work on Lazy Afternoon by collaborating with {{different}} producers, such as Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes. Because of the lackluster critical response generated from {{the release of}} her previous album, ButterFly (1974), and her personal dislike for the record, she had wished to collaborate with new musicians for the then-upcoming album. Holmes, in particular, was nervous while working with the singer. Following the completion of the album and in order to thank Holmes for their collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't be frightened, you're the best, love Barbra". Specifically, she <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the track [...] "My Father's Song", which she considered to be [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal" [...] to her.|$|E

500|$|Although Levin had {{rejected}} Judaism when a youth, he quested after spirituality. Such religious sympathies as he had, he said, were [...] "with quietist faiths, like Buddhism, {{on the one}} hand, and with a straightforward message of salvation, like Christianity, on the other". With the help of Stassinopoulos he continued to search after spiritual truth. She later wrote, [...] "He tried therapy, he tried Insight, a self-awareness seminar that I had helped to bring to London, he tried a stint in an ashram in India. Lesser souls would have avoided the ridicule that was heaped on him for his spiritual 'search' by simply keeping it to himself. But he didn't, because anything he <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> he had to write about". In 1980 he wrote extensive accounts in his column about {{his visit to the}} Indian commune of the meditation teacher Osho.|$|E
500|$|Age of Empires IIIs {{multiplayer}} was {{the first}} in the series to be integrated into the game interface and was highly lauded, as was the Home City concept. The topic of multiplayer <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> GameZone, who said [...] "this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players," [...] while at 1UP, the reviewer commented similarly, stating, [...] "Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans {{and a number of other}} useful features." [...] GameSpy commented on the Home City as well, saying, [...] "the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy." [...] EuroGamer, however, stated: [...] "Stop with the gifts!...You do not need to let me flick to a home city screen every few minutes so that I can select a free unit or resource windfall. I'm not some spoilt toddler that needs to be bribed with endless sweeties." [...] Age of empires III uses the ESO server for multiplayer.|$|E
500|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a {{guaranteed}} minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared {{with most of the}} leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> this spontaneous gesture and observed, [...] "You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris." [...] Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him [...] "the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion".|$|E

[...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume.

500|$|Thanksgiving {{services}} in the diocese of London were held {{at the end of}} April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe. Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant. Susan Clarencieux revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles. Mary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. There was no baby. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to [...] "end in wind rather than anything else". It was most likely a false pregnancy, perhaps induced by Mary's overwhelming desire to have a child. In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered to be [...] "God's punishment" [...] for her having [...] "tolerated heretics" [...] in her realm, Philip left England to command his armies against France in Flanders. Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the queen's grief; he wrote she was [...] "extraordinarily in love" [...] with her husband, and was disconsolate at his departure.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.8/5 {{and said that}} he did not think the episode could have been {{executed}} better. Wolfe emphasized Ziva's back story with her father and speculated that many of her choices were based upon events that her family experienced, including her father's repeated absences and the breakup of her parents' marriage due to Eli's indiscretions with a young Orli Elbaz, which also explained Ziva's resentment of Elbaz. [...] Wolfe <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> Ziva's dance with Tony, and her flashback to dancing with her father as a child while he tells her, [...] "My Ziva. One day you will dance with a man who deserves your love". In a TV Fanatic round table, Steve Marsi added, [...] "What an emotionally loaded quote from the Eli flashback, followed by the much-anticipated present-day dance." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Sirtis did well as the new Mossad director and that [...] "Counselor Deanna Troi was nothing but a faint memory". Michelle Calbert from TV Equals praised the storyline and agreed that Marina Sirtis performed well in the role, saying that she found Orli to be a more likeable character than Eli David.|$|E
