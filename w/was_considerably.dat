His impact in the two seasons with the Trail Blazers <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> less than in previous seasons. His average was 16.3ppg/7.5rpg and 16.8/7.3rpg for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 campaigns respectively. At {{the end of the}} 2004–05 season, Abdur-Rahim became a free agent.|$|E

5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> more advanced {{than it had been}} during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E

5|$|On 13–14 November, Ferdinand of Bavaria (Ernst's brother) and the Count of Arenberg {{took the}} Elector's castle at Poppelsdorf; on 18 November, {{they moved to}} attack the Godesburg.

5|$|After Montagu's death his son {{elected to}} {{continue}} living at nearby Townhill Park House, and South Stoneham was subsequently sold to University College Southampton (now the University of Southampton) {{for use as}} student accommodation. In 1964 the building <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> altered by adding a 17-storey tower and a kitchen and dining complex to the building. In 2004 the University submitted plans to demolish these extensions {{with the intention of}} converting the original house into a conference venue and building new blocks of flats on the remaining landscaped gardens.

5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|At Panola, Oppong earned all-conference {{honors and}} led them to a fairly {{successful}} season in the NJCAA Region XIV. Entering the next season, he became a high-end Canadian recruit for programs in the NCAA. Oppong ultimately chose to play for Eastern Kentucky under head coach Jeff Neubauer. He was a starter {{from time to time}} as his junior season progressed. However, he suffered a shoulder injury {{in the middle of the}} season that sidelined him for several of his games. He returned to the starting lineup by the postseason. Oppong did not earn any major awards at the Division I level, but <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> more effective as a senior, as he developed into a bigger scorer for Eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the advance}} voting period, the total number of votes was 1,249,198, or 31.2% of the electorate, with more women voting. In the {{previous}} election, 29.2% voted in advance. Significantly, President Tarja Halonen voted during advance voting. However, there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April. The expatriate vote <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> higher than in the previous election, up from 8.6% in 2007 to 15%. The Foreign Ministry said that {{out of a total of}} 228,000 expatriates eligible to vote 35,049 cast their ballots at the Finnish diplomatic missions, which was up from 27,399.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, the park system <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport {{has been replaced by}} a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911. Shortly after completion she ran aground off the Romanian port of Constanţa in October 1911, but was only slightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904.

Fitting-out, however, <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of £124,000 <b>was</b> <b>considerably</b> more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E
