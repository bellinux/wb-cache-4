500|$|In December 1944, the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, ordered Groves, now the Director of the Manhattan Project, {{to find a}} deputy. Stimson was {{concerned}} {{about what would happen}} if Groves became incapacitated. [...] "You can have any officer in the Army," [...] Stimson told Groves, [...] "no matter who he is, or what duty he is on." [...] Groves told Colonel Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, that his first choice would be Farrell. Nichols replied: [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> first choice too."

On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Posts PopWrap that she wrote [...] "the best [...] ever written" [...] {{a week and a}} half ago and that Beyoncé had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as [...] "a career song and probably my favorite thing I've ever written". The development of [...] "I Was Here" [...] was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyoncé since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that [...] "I Was Here" [...] was the ideal timing, [...] "I thought that the one artist who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> dream to sing [...] would be Beyoncé.

500|$|In 1971, Brown {{sold his}} {{interest}} in KFC to Heublein for $284 million (. Using some of the profits from the KFC sale, Brown and some associates bought the Miami-based Lum's chain of restaurants from its founders, Stuart and Clifford S Perlman, for $4 million. Of the 340-outlet beer-and-hot-dog chain, Brown said [...] "they did not have very good food. I figured that upgrading it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> first task." [...] Accordingly, he hired {{a group of young}} executives to find [...] "the perfect hamburger". A month later, he hired Ollie Gleichenhaus, owner of a hamburger restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida, to train Lum's staff to create his hamburgers. He later started a chain of drive-through restaurants called Ollie's Trolley, named for Gleichenhaus, but the franchise failed. Lions Club International at Tampa, Florida, honored Brown with its Service to America Award in 1974. Brown sold the Lum's chain for $9.5 million to Friedrich Jahn's Wienerwald holding group in 1978. A few years later, Brown launched John Y's Chicken, a venture which also subsequently failed.|$|E
500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{consequence}} {{of the end of}} British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad—approve it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger—before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed the Reverend SJ du Toit to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new President the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which [...] "God's Word <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> rule of conduct"—as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would [...] "prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and [...] "obedient native races in their appointed districts". He defeated Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as President on 9 May 1883.|$|E

500|$|Perry is a LGBT rights activist. She {{supported}} Stonewall {{during their}} [...] "It gets better..... today" [...] campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song [...] "Firework" [...] to the It Gets Better Project. Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> prayer for the future." [...] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008 it was {{announced}} that the show's creators had decided to kill the character off. It was confirmed that Jenny would still appear throughout the season in a [...] "flashback" [...] format. The first episode of the final season starts with Jenny's murder. However the final series focuses on the events leading up to her death. Chaiken revealed that each episode would focus and tease with another motive. She described how it would play out, stating: [...] "There's one character {{at the beginning of each}} show who comes forward with the motive of the moment. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> reason for killing Jenny." [...] The storyline was described as a [...] "sub-plot" [...] which would define the final season, but not [...] "overpower" [...] it. However, when the final episode aired there was no reveal to who killed Jenny. Showtime released a mini-series titled [...] "Interrogation Tapes" [...] online, via the official website. Each video featured a fellow character being interviewed over the death of Jenny - although the killer was still not revealed. Kate Aurthur of Los Angeles Times questioned if viewers would still want to watch the season after Jenny is killed. New York later gave a large amount of praise to Jenny commenting: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian stated her death was long overdue.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to those artists who state that Bush has been a direct influence on their own careers, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for her work including Annie Lennox, Björk, Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine, Little Boots, Dido, Sky Ferreira, St. Vincent, Lily Allen, Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons, Big Boi of OutKast, Tupac Shakur, Steven Wilson, Steve Rothery of Marillion, and André Matos. Courtney Love of Hole mentioned Bush among other artists {{as one of her}} favourites as a teenager. Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: [...] "Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> bible". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds Of Love: [...] "I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be [...] "beauty beyond belief". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled [...] "Bird in Hand" [...] (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers who Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls.

500|$|Manchester City's {{downward}} trajectory {{toward the}} Second Division {{continued in the}} 1997–98 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He {{had a reputation for}} playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the [...] "Dogs of War". Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words [...] "We have to sell Kinkladze". After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1–2 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3–1 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, [...] Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the Manchester Evening News summarised as [...] "barely noticeable". Vale defeated City 2–1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: [...] "To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am not saying that City's ills were all down to Kinkladze, but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> weak link not my strong one." [...] With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom [...] "if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win". Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel {{before the start of the}} match. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by The Observers reporter as a [...] "calamity" [...] culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2–2 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5–2 win against Stoke City. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0–0 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy.|$|E

[...] Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, [...] "suggesting hallucination" [...] in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.|$|E

2500|$|After the Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, {{he joined a}} Connecticut militia and was elected first {{lieutenant}} within five months. His militia unit participated in the Siege of Boston, but Hale remained behind. It {{has been suggested that}} he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or whether he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, [...] "Was I in your condition, I think the more extensive service <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> choice.
