2500|$|I {{am trying}} to ferret out some very {{specific}} information about monitoring software defect trends. Again, it <b>was</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> but I was a software development Program Manager and my team used a tool that tracked the progress of a defect find/fix rate over time. This trend was called a [...] "glide slope". It was not a crystal ball but was reasonably illustrative in forecasting code stability and release date. I can't locate my copy of the algorithm and have been doing an Internet search with no luck. Thanks for any help that you can provide.|$|E
2500|$|Unitas {{was traded}} to the San Diego Chargers in 1973 after posting a 5-9 record in 1972 with Baltimore, but he was far past his prime. He {{replaced}} former Chargers quarterback John Hadl. He was replaced in Baltimore by Marty Domres, who had been acquired from the San Diego Chargers in August, 1972. Domres was ultimately replaced by LSU's Bert Jones, drafted with the number two overall pick in 1973. Unitas started the season with a 38-0 loss to the Washington Redskins. He threw for just 55 yards and 3 interceptions, and was sacked 8 times. His final victory as a starter came against the Buffalo Bills in week two. Unitas was 10-18 for 175 yards, two touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a 34-7 Chargers rout [...] Unitas was clearly not the same player he <b>was</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and many were questioning his role as a starter after a loss to the Bengals in week three. Two weeks later, he threw two first-half interceptions, passed for only 19 yards, and went 2-for-9 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was then replaced by rookie quarterback, future Hall-of-Famer Dan Fouts. After having posted a 1-3 record as a starter, Unitas retired in the preseason of 1974.|$|E

60|$|As I {{have said}} before, hunting, {{especially}} in our eastern states, {{is not what}} it <b>was</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Almost all of the big game has disappeared, and the fellow who can get a deer or a moose without going a good many weary miles for the game is lucky.

The boys see much that is new, novel, and pleasing--new fruits, new flowers, new animals--and have often to use their wits to the utmost, to get themselves out of serious difficulty and also to make themselves, and those under their protection, comfortable.|$|E
60|$|The {{ground on}} which this chamber stood had, at one time, not within his recollection, been a yard; and had been {{converted}} to its present purpose for use as an office.

It was a blotched, stained, mouldering room, like a vault; and there were water-pipes running through it, which at unexpected times in the night, when other things were quiet, clicked and gurgled suddenly, as if they were choking.|$|E
