5|$|As {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} 9th Battalion began to arrive, Newland {{was able to}} repulse a third attack by the Germans. Reorganising the 9th and 12th Battalions, a combined counter-attack {{was able to be}} launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, with 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.|$|E
5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be {{converted}} into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte.

Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career {{at the age of}} nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.|$|E

5|$|Pitchers {{have been}} named Series MVP twenty-seven times; four of them were relief pitchers. Twelve of the first {{fourteen}} World Series MVPs were won by pitchers; from 1969 until 1986, the proportion of pitcher MVPs declined—Rollie Fingers (1974) and Bret Saberhagen (1985) <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> pitchers to win the award in this period. From 1987 until 1991, all of the World Series MVPs were pitchers, and, since 1995, pitchers have won the award nine times. Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees is the only player in World Series history to be named MVP despite being on the losing team.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens have {{developed}} strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, {{with whom they}} frequently shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada {{and two of the}} largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide. From 1938 to 1970, they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Canadian teams in the league.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{interest}} in the road came in mid-1969, when the National Park Service approved a plan to develop the facilities with Amistad. The Rough Canyon and Diablo East portions of the park were given particular focus, since they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> that were in existence at the time. Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, {{in an attempt to}} increase tourism.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Johnston had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, invariably batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their first-class career, and they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Australians {{who failed to}} pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, Toshack and Johnston were rooted {{at the bottom of}} the batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 first-class fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest first-class score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s.|$|E

5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, {{the southernmost}} {{action of the}} Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both {{were lost in the}} early hours of 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein began deejaying {{in clubs}} in Los Angeles {{and joined the}} band Crazy Town in 1999. He left the group in 2001 and focused on {{a career as a}} solo DJ.

In 2006, he {{accepted}} a $1 million contract to perform weekly at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas strip and was also charging upwards of $10,000 for private events. In 2008 Goldstein and Travis Barker formed the duo TRV$DJAM.

5|$|In 1936, Shepard, Ominsky, and Finnerty {{were all}} reelected to the legislature.

He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951.

5|$|The German forces {{attacked}} Newland's company {{several times}} during the battle, but were repulsed each time. During one of the assaults, Newland observed that the German attack was weakening and gathered a party of twenty men. Leading the group, he charged the Germans and seized forty as prisoners. As reinforcements from the 9th Battalion began to arrive, a combined counter-attack was launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. During the engagement, the 12th Battalion suffered 125 casualties, including 66 killed or missing. Newland and Whittle were both awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions at Boursies and Lagnicourt; they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war. At 35 years and 7 months old, Newland was also the oldest Australian Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The Olympics {{were then}} halted {{due to the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. There were five skiers, two cross-country and three downhill—who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown—three figure skaters and one speed skater. Adrian Swan and Nancy Burley, who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating, <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Australia competitors to place in the top 20, although neither placed in {{the top half of}} the field.

5|$|The {{bombs and}} fire lances of the Jin <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> weapons of the Jurchens that the Mongols were wary of facing. The Jurchen {{deployment}} of gunpowder was extensive, {{but it is}} not certain if the Mongols had acquired gunpowder from the Jurchens before this point. Herbert Franke maintains that gunpowder was in the arsenal of both combatants, but Turnbull believes that only the Jurchens made use of it. The Mongols loaded their catapults with large stones or bombs of gunpowder, which were fired at the Jin fortifications. The barrage inflicted casualties in the city and had a psychological impact on the soldiers operating the Jurchen trebuchets.|$|E
