It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became recognized in the United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they were getting positive <b>write-ups</b> in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that the aircraft {{was the subject of}} a large number of complaints by pilots, called <b>write-ups</b> in the aviation industry. The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side vertical speed indicator, which informs the air crew of the rate (in ft/min: Feet Per Minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash. The aircraft's left right inertial reference system, which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times. The International Herald Tribune reported that this may be of particular significance. The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen <b>write-ups.</b> Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions. Several complaints were made that the flaps, which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, and there were two complaints that the weather radar was faulty.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} support of high-assurance <b>write-up</b> actions in {{multilevel}} secure object-oriented databases under the replicated architecture.

[...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, declaring that the script was peopled from the [...] "Stock Characters Store" [...] and [...] "the movie could have been (a) a gay love story, or (b) an attack on the Mormon Church, but is an awkward fit by trying to be (c) both at the same time".

At this stage, some stations such as London Greek Radio had huge followings, and LGR were broadcasting with an aerial {{on the roof of}} a store. Other stations such as the Sunday Station Rock FM were broadcasting live from home studios linked via wireless links to their main tower block transmitter. RFM DJs each had their own microwave links to the transmitter from their home studios in New Cross, Hertford, and Hainault to name but three locations. Unlike stations playing Rave music, and taking advertising, RFM had no advertisers and built a significant following, helped by <b>write-ups</b> in Time Out and other culture magazines and a mailing address. [...] On Saturdays, London Rock also built a significant following, broadcasting from a transmitter atop Simla House near London Bridge. As with RFM, the station played rock music and was not aided by advertising or the rave scene to which these stations had no connections.

[...] The San Francisco Chronicle had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to [...] "a brilliant piece in the Atlantic Monthly that's (thankfully) come to cinematic life." [...] The New York Times had a more skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare attacks on Bill Clinton by American conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a review by literary and film critic A.

[...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next.
