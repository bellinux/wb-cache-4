500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have [...] "consequences that change their relationship" [...] forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode [...] "milked" [...] the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire.

Masaya knows Mew Ichigo's real identity, but initially pretends otherwise as he knows Ichigo does not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Ichigo describes Masaya as [...] "smart", [...] "cute", [...] "very athletic" [...] and [...] "popular at school". He is also depicted {{as being a}} polite and calm person, though he does have moments when he yells at others in anger and acts jealous and possessive regarding Ichigo. Towards {{the end of the}} series, Masaya reveals that as an orphan, he began acting like a [...] "perfect child" [...] to be adopted, in reality, however, he felt sick of humans and disgusted by how they treat the planet.

2500|$|On 6 November 1958, in Paris, Prime Minister de Gaulle {{presented}} {{to his old}} wartime ally Winston Churchill the Croix de la Lib√©ration. De Gaulle remarked: [...] "I want Sir Winston to know this. Today's ceremony means that France remembers what she owes him. I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> this: {{the man who has}} just had the honour of bestowing this distinction upon him values and admires him more than ever."

2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E
