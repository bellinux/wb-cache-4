5|$|A civil airport, Białystok-Krywlany Airport, {{lies within}} the city limits, but does not provide {{regularly}} scheduled service. There were plans in 2011 {{to build a new}} regional airport, Białystok-Saniki Airport, that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> flights within Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gore also {{supported}} {{the funding of}} the controversial, and much-delayed satellite called Triana, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> {{an image of the}} Earth 24 hours a day, over the internet and would have acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming. During his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore ran, in part, on a pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E

25|$|This junction, the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the London Motorway Box, <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> traffic movements in all directions. {{it is probable that}} SCR traffic <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been directed onto to the A2 or A20 and <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been able to access the East Cross Route northbound.|$|R
5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory. The British {{did not have the}} military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even had they been able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The endosymbiotic {{relationship}} of mitochondria with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria descended from bacteria that somehow survived endocytosis by another cell, and became {{incorporated into the}} cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on glycolysis and fermentation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7 to 2 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower {{would have been}} a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around the outside of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - the walkway <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
50|$|The National Library of Scotland {{speculates that}} these chapbooks {{may have been}} test-pieces for the press. Their sale <b>would</b> also <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> a {{source of income for}} the new enterprise.|$|R

6000|$|To {{provide for}} this deficit, the Government {{actually}} increased its [...] debt by £600,000,000. A slight additional exertion <b>would</b> <b>have</b> [...] <b>provided</b> £150,000,000 more of revenue, and saved £450,000,000 to [...] the taxpayers.(109) ...|$|R
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
25|$|While {{serving as}} Secretary of Defense, Wilson enacted {{stronger}} rules against human medical experimentation. The 1953 Wilson Memo led {{the military to}} adopt the Nuremberg Code: Patients <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>provide</b> written, informed consent.|$|R

Still, the man you dealt with <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> for that difficulty." ...|$|R
50|$|If the {{vibration}} is periodic, then {{the control system}} may adapt to the ongoing vibration, thereby providing better cancellation than <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>provided</b> simply by reacting to each new acceleration without referring to past accelerations.|$|R
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E

50|$|Enforcement of {{this ruling}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{proven to be}} problematic, since states not {{lowering}} the voting age {{to the age of}} 18 for state elections <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to <b>provide</b> special federal-election only ballots to citizens between 18 and 20 voting in federal elections. States <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to maintain two sets of voting registries, one for those between the ages of 18 to 20 and another for those 21 and older.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006 Ireland Chief Justice Murray told Di Stefano that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>provide</b> {{proof of}} his legal {{qualifications}} before he could act for Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland and be his legal representative, and he eventually ruled that Di Stefano <b>had</b> failed to <b>provide</b> any credential.|$|R
5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E
5|$|Richard, Edward II's second son, took {{possession}} of Lydford Castle in 1239 as the Earl of Cornwall. Richard took a close {{interest in developing}} the town of Lydford, creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in the 1260s. Around this time, the main tower at Lydford Castle was demolished and rebuilt, probably by Richard, possibly following a serious fire in the building. Richard was a wealthy politician and rebuilding the castle in this way <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> him with an important status symbol in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the folk}} blues the singer fills up {{occasional}} gaps with words like 'Oh, lawdy' or 'Oh, baby' and the like. This meant that in writing a melody to be sung in the blues manner one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>provide</b> gaps or waits.|$|R
50|$|Original plans {{called for}} a seventh transmitter, CKGN-TV-36 from Maxville, near Cornwall. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{primarily}} served Hawkesbury, but <b>would</b> <b>have</b> also <b>provided</b> a fairly strong grade B signal to Montreal. However, Global was forced to drop the Maxville transmitter from his proposal due to a CRTC moratorium on new stations in Montreal.|$|R
50|$|Both three- and four-engine {{variants}} <b>would</b> therefore <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> useful payload capacities (Saturn C-3) intermediate {{between the}} Saturn IB and Saturn V, and re-using Saturn V components would reduce costs and simplify ground operations compared to building {{an entirely new}} launcher in that payload range.|$|R
5|$|The Icelandic sagas, in {{particular}} Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, claim that Sigurd, like Olaf's father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair {{in the male}} line. Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada's father, along with {{other parts of the}} Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada's lifetime) rather than historical reality. Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, which seems odd considering that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{portion of}} NY117 in Katonah {{passed through a}} {{historic}} district containing several homes {{dating back to the}} late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> an alternate route to I-684 from NY117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used NY117 would shake the historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY117 in Katonah began in 1976 {{at the request of the}} town of Bedford.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in {{comparison}} {{to those of other}} ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. These were structurally similar to Sharpey's fibers, and were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> the ankylosaurids with an armor covering which was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.|$|E
50|$|When built, univallate cross dykes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{consisted}} of a bare stone bank topped with a palisade, sometimes accompanied by a ditch. Archaeological investigations have revealed that the banks were constructed with rubble; {{some of them were}} then faced with stonework. Some of the banks may have been topped by hedges. Univallate cross dykes <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>provided</b> a great obstacle to passage; multivallate cross dykes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more formidable to cross.|$|R
2500|$|In return, arms <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>provided</b> to Ireland and British {{forces would}} {{cooperate}} on a German invasion.

5000|$|Some {{automakers}} {{say that}} the federal government is not doing enough with the scrappage program and contrasted it with the American Car Allowance Rebate System, where people who bring in a vehicle less than 25 years old may receive US$3,500 to US$4,500 towards a new vehicle. For example, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, says a stronger scrappage program <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>provide</b> a better boost to the economy while taking polluting vehicles off the road. As a result, some automakers have created their own programs on top of the federal scrappage program that increase cash incentives in hopes of increasing vehicle sales.|$|R
