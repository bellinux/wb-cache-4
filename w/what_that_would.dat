On December 6, 2010, he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote Freedom where they discussed that book and the controversy over his reservations about her picking The Corrections and <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> entail.|$|E
500|$|The Congress {{followed}} the failed Cripps mission by demanding, in August 1942, that the British immediately [...] "Quit India", proclaiming a mass campaign of satyagraha until they did. [...] The British promptly arrested most major {{leaders of the}} Congress and imprisoned them {{for the remainder of}} the war. [...] Gandhi, however, was placed on house arrest in one of the Aga Khan's palaces prior to his release for health reasons in 1944. [...] With the Congress leaders absent from the political scene, Jinnah warned against the threat of Hindu domination and maintained his Pakistan demand without going into great detail about <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> entail. [...] Jinnah also worked to increase the League's political control at the provincial level. [...] He helped to found the newspaper Dawn in the early 1940s in Delhi; it helped to spread the League's message and eventually became the major English-language newspaper of Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Griffin {{describes}} herself as a [...] "non-believer". In her book Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin, Griffin said that while in high school, she fell away from the Roman Catholic Church. She considered becoming a Unitarian but wasn't sure <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> involve. On March 9, 2008, Kathy Griffin became an ordained minister with the Universal One Church of Carrabelle, Florida.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the debate}} {{surrounding}} a presumed culture gap between civilian and military societies had continued {{since at least the}} early 1950s, it became prominent in the early 1990s with the conclusion of the Cold War. The promised [...] "peace dividend" [...] led to a debate over changes in American national security strategy and <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> mean in terms of the transformation of the mission, composition, and character of the armed forces.|$|E
2500|$|... "You and I {{should not}} now {{pull on the}} ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you and I pull, the tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. <b>What</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> mean I need not explain to you, because you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Alex Garland was {{inspired}} to write Sunshine based on scientific ideas about the heat death of the universe, specifically [...] "an article projecting the future of mankind from a physics-based, atheist perspective", according to Garland. The article was from an American scientific periodical, and Garland had wondered about what would result from the Sun's death. Garland said of the project: [...] "What interested me {{was the idea that}} it could get to a point when the entire planet's survival rests on the shoulders of one man, and <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> do to his head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the Act itself was noted by Michael Moore in his controversial film Fahrenheit 9/11. In one of the scenes of the movie, he records Congressman Jim McDermott alleging that no Senator had read the bill and John Conyers, Jr. as saying, [...] "We don't read most of the bills. Do you really know <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> entail if we read every bill that we passed?" [...] Congressman Conyers then answers his own rhetorical question, asserting {{that if they did}} it would [...] "slow down the legislative process". As a dramatic device, Moore then hired an ice-cream van and drove around Washington, D.C. with a loud speaker, reading out the Act to puzzled passers-by, which included a few Senators.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Murray's {{family lived}} in poverty and were {{constantly}} moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and [...] "had a violent {{couple of years of}} being out on the street." [...] He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing [...] "Voodoo Chile" [...] by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, [...] "everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What is THAT? How do you do THAT?' And I started hanging around the rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, thinking about getting into the big time, wondering <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be like." [...] After [...] "hanging 'round record stores" [...] and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, [...] "this sort of soft-rock, American-type band," [...] and The Secret, [...] "this sort of mad punk band," [...] with whom he would record a single, [...] "Café De Dance", in 1975.|$|E
