5|$|The {{situation}} <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> in Huế, where Diệm had banned {{demonstrations and}} ordered his forces to arrest those {{who engaged in}} civil disobedience. At 13:00, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế for a rally, having gathered at the Bến Ngư Bridge near the Perfume River. A confrontation ensued when the protestors attempted to cross the bridge. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowd.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{contemporary}} egalitarians {{have been}} identified as luck egalitarians, believing, roughly, that it is bad when one person <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off than another through no fault or choice of her own. Temkin argues that the egalitarian’s fundamental concern should not be with luck per se but with comparative fairness. His view is that, among equally deserving people, it is bad, because unfair, for some to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> off than others through no fault or choice of their own. But, among unequally deserving people, it is not bad, because not unfair, for someone less deserving to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> off than someone more deserving, even if the former <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off through no fault or choice of her own. [...] To illustrate, egalitarians need not object if criminal John <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off than law-abiding Mary, even if John craftily avoided capture and <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off only because, through no fault or choice of his own, a falling limb injured him. In that case the effects of luck need not trouble egalitarians because they do not undermine comparative fairness.|$|R

Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback {{at the end of the}} season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad.

RVD claimed that WWE deserved no credit, that the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> in Huế, {{where the}} approach of government forces was met by the beating of Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left {{their homes in the}} middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E

And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> than any wound.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and glitches in his review copy would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged {{power lines}} and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused {{flooding}} in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275million worth of crops, mostly to vegetables and sugar cane. In some locations, the crop damage <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state. Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef system {{to a greater extent}} than Andrew. Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236buildings, causing $26million in damage. Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, some of which were washed out. In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer. Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves. Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43people. There were also three indirect deaths; two were from traffic accidents, and one was related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road. Statewide damage was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD).|$|E
