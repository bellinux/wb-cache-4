The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never heard of such a demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E

The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, but what we really need is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now." [...] During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as [...] "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving...

Edge compared Squall unfavorably with Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife, saying that Squall's angst [...] "didn't seem to have any context" [...] (unlike Cloud's, which developed from one of the pivotal events in Final Fantasy VII).

2500|$|Melkonian was an Armenian {{nationalist}} and {{a revolutionary}} socialist. Throughout {{his life he}} sympathized with Marxism–Leninism, which was also the ideology of ASALA. Vorbach wrote in 1994 that his writings [...] "expose him as an Armenian nationalist and a committed socialist of the Marxist-Leninist variety." [...] According to his brother he [...] "had not always been a communist, {{but he had never}} been an ex-communist." [...] Melkonian hoped that the Soviet Union would [...] "reform itself, democratize, and promote personal freedoms" [...] and did not abandon hope in Soviet Armenia {{until the end of the}} Soviet era appeared inevitable. Philip Marsden wrote that his career [...] "reveals the profound shift in radical ideology—from revolutionary Marxism to nationalism." [...] Marsden adds that in the 1980s his ideology came into conflict with a growing nationalism: [...] "With ever greater difficulty, he squeezed the Armenian question into the context of left-wing orthodoxy, believing for instance that Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> error." [...] In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas and its unification with Soviet Armenia. In the 1980s, while in a French prison, he called for the creation of a guerilla force in eastern Turkey which would unite Kurdish rebels, left-wing Turks, and Armenian revolutionaries. Vorbach summarized his views on Turkey: ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{are writing}} {{to express our}} {{profound}} concern over the prospect that the Czech Republic may be planning to legalize prostitution ... We believe that such action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake for {{the country as a}} whole and, in particular, for the women and children of the Eastern Europe region who will be victims of the Czech Republic sex trade ... We are certain that legalizing prostitution within the Czech Republic will not curb abuses such as child prostitution and enslaving sex trafficking. Organized crime controls the [...] "industry" [...] and, in a legalized regime, it will have an enhanced capacity to do so ... Brothels are sexual gulags for women and girls ... A decision to accommodate traffickers, pimps, and organized crime's slave trade in girls and women [...] an act unworthy of Czechs' traditions of fighting for their own freedom. It is an act we will resist with every democratic means available to us, and will fight in Congress and our legislatures, through our organized women's movements and from tens of thousands of church and synagogue pulpits. At a minimum, we are determined that our efforts will in financial terms alone, be more costly to the Republic — and not in terms of tourism alone — than any hypothetical financial gains claimed. We close by urging you to reject the calls for legalization that sully the reputation of the Czech Republic and dishonor its history. Please take a leadership role in resisting the trade in women and children and please, in a manner consistent with your traditions, maintain the Republic as a model for human rights and democracy.|$|E

[...] He stated: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> precedent if we start moving backwards into the era {{in which we are}} seeing military coups as a means of political transition, rather than democratic elections." [...] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, equivocated, saying that [...] "We do think that this has evolved into a coup" [...] and noting that under U.S. law, officially declaring a coup would oblige the U.S. to cut off most foreign aid to Honduras." [...] Cutting off aid was seen as a possibility {{in the days after the}} coup, and State Department Director of Policy Planning Anne-Marie Slaughter urged Clinton to [...] "take bold action" [...] and to [...] "find that [...] coup was a ‘military coup’ under U.S. law." [...] Nevertheless, Clinton did not do so, and the U.S. never formally declared that a coup had occurred. By November 2009, the U.S. [...] "focused on pushing for elections" [...] in the country. In September 2009, the Board of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation, headed by Clinton, cut off $11 million in aid to the Honduran government in the wake of the coup, and suspended another $4 million in planned contributions to a road project. From 2009 to mid-2016, however, the U.S. provided about $200 million in military and police aid to Honduras, a controversial decision given the violence in Honduras and the government's human rights violations.|$|E
