25|$|It {{was shown}} {{that during the}} fight in Connecticut, Giant-Man became enraged when the Wasp was killed by Hobgoblin. This led him to crush Vulture <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> step on Crossbones. As he charged the villains, Avalanche used his {{abilities}} to shake the ground. Moloids emerged and attack Giant-Man, causing him to fall to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Suffering from kidney disease, Garrison {{continued}} to weaken during April 1879. He moved to New York {{to live with}} his daughter Fanny's family. In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him. Fanny asked if he would enjoy singing some hymns. Although he was unable to sing, his children sang favorite hymns while he beat time <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet. On May 24, 1879, Garrison lost consciousness and died just before midnight.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} display is the behavior of breaking branches, which {{all members of the}} group carry out. Even infants break small branches (or twigs), letting them fall to the soil, but the most spectacular is the alpha male who chooses large, dry branches which he hits <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet in spectacular jumps, so that they fall. Usually such branches make a tremendous sound as they fall through the other branches, {{and the members of the}} group become very excited and chatter loudly. This behavior is quite commonly discharged towards an observer when the animals have lost their fear.|$|E

25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, and squeeze <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E
500|$|Bitten by a {{slightly}} different genetically engineered spider {{than the one that}} granted Peter Parker's powers, Miles Morales possesses abilities similar to the original Spider-Man's, including enhanced strength and agility, the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet, and a [...] "spider sense" [...] that warns him of danger with a buzzing sensation in his head. Though his strength and agility {{are similar to those of}} the original Spider-Man, his spider-sense is not as strong, as it only warns him of immediate danger.|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{was then}} penalized with a {{controversial}} foul call that sent Wade {{to the line}} to shoot the go-ahead free throws with 1.9 seconds left on the overtime game clock. Wade hit the first free throw, and Dallas Mavericks coach Avery Johnson signaled to his team to call a timeout after Wade's second attempt. [...] Josh Howard then made a timeout gesture <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> began to walk off the floor, and the referees called the Mavericks' last remaining timeout, which prevented them from advancing the ball after the second attempt if Wade converted. [...] After the timeout, Wade made the second free throw to give his team a one-point lead, after which Devin Harris missed a Hail Mary half-court shot as time expired. [...] Wade finished the game with 43 points while setting an NBA Finals record for most made free throws in a game with 21. Shaquille O'Neal added a double-double with 18 points and 12 rebounds. [...] Miami converted 32 of its 49 attempts from the free throw line.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} many wise people were there, yet {{they had to}} come to Moses, for they could not erect the Tabernacle on their own. Moses excelled them all in skill, as Solomon said in [...] "Many daughters have done valiantly, but you excel them all." [...] So each of the wise people took a {{finished}} piece of work and came to Moses to present him the boards, the bars, and all the parts. As soon as Moses saw the parts, the Holy Spirit settled on him, and he set the Tabernacle up. The Midrash clarified that Moses did not set it up by himself, for miracles were performed with it, and it rose of its own accord, for [...] says (using the passive voice), [...] "The Tabernacle was reared up." [...] And the Midrash taught that Solomon's Temple, too, was built of its own accord. Similarly, noting that [...] reports that [...] "the Tabernacle was reared up" [...] – using the passive voice – another Midrash told that when in [...] God told Moses to set up the Tabernacle, Moses protested {{that he did not know}} how to set it up. So God told Moses to begin working <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> make a show of setting it up, and the Tabernacle would stand up on its own. But God reassured Moses that God would record that Moses set it up, as [...] reports, [...] "Moses reared up the Tabernacle." ...|$|E
