500|$|I am unalterably {{opposed to}} this bill because Judaism need not call upon the State to settle its own {{internal}} affairs. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> a dangerous precedent in California which can only lead to evil consequences.Four years ago you assisted in preventing an increase of [...] "wine rabbis." [...] The law relative to sacramental wine was properly surrounded, and California Jews do not suffer the disgrace which eastern brethren feel.This will bring a [...] "meat rabbi" [...] into existence. New York state has this kosher law and yet it did not prevent the terrible scandal which was uncovered last month in New York City. Use your best influence to prevent it.If Judaism has not enough inner resources to meet present day conditions, the sooner it passes away the better.|$|E
500|$|In January 2014, the {{restaurant}} was closed temporarily for renovations, with no timeline offered for the project. The Oregonian also reported that {{the restaurant}}'s phone number was disconnected and its website inactive. Signage confirmed the closure, stating: [...] "Esparza's will be temporarily closed while renovating and regrouping. Thank you for your patience. We will re-open soon." [...] However, several days later, the owners confirmed the restaurant's permanent closure, posting a note that said: [...] "We have closed our business after 24 years. We {{would like to thank}} you for supporting us. We have enjoyed the friendships made over the years. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> a new chapter in our lives– relaxing and enjoying life. Thank you for your support." [...] The Oregonian published an article containing memories of the restaurant submitted by readers. Esparza's was replaced by The Blue Goose, a [...] "Southwestern-grill-meets-New-Mexico" [...] restaurant serving Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, named after the neighborhood tavern of similar title that occupied the building.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 May 2007 {{power was}} devolved, the Assembly met, and Paisley and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness were elected First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland. Speaking at Stormont to an invited {{international}} audience he said, [...] "Today {{at long last}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> upon the road—I emphasise starting—which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province." [...] Paisley and McGuinness subsequently established a good working relationship and were dubbed by the Northern Irish media as the [...] "Chuckle Brothers".|$|E
6000|$|... "Further," [...] Quest continued, [...] "there's my chauffeur. He {{knows exactly}} {{what time it was}} when the tire of my car blew out, just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> for New York." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{a day or}} two. I {{have some}} things here to attend to that may delay us that long. But when once <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>started</b> southward <b>we</b> shall bowl along right merrily." ...|$|R
60|$|Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> Vrouw Prinsloo {{appeared}} {{from behind the}} other wagon, and with her Marie, who, I noticed, was very pale and whose beautiful eyes were red, as though with weeping.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before the}} strike began, the press begged the unions to reconsider. In part they were frightened {{by some of}} labor’s rhetoric, like the labor {{newspaper}} editorial that proclaimed: [...] "We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> on a road that leads [...] NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!" [...] Daily newspapers saw the general strike as a foreign import: [...] "This is America [...] not Russia," [...] one said when denouncing the general strike. The non-striking part of Seattle's population imagined the worst and stocked up on food. Hardware stores sold their stock of guns.|$|E
2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We all do," [...] I answered, [...] "especially if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> in life. So {{when it is}} {{convenient}} to you to settle your debts I shall be glad." ...|$|E
60|$|Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting,</b> I met the lad William Wood, who {{had come}} down from the Mission huts, where he lived with Mr. Owen, and was {{wandering}} about with an anxious face.|$|R
5000|$|Singer Mike Patton {{criticized the}} album in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "split Because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> to make bad music. And that's {{when you need}} to pull the plug. Our next record would have been a piece of shit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Hirst," [...] said Hewet, after a pause, [...] "I have {{a terrible}} {{confession}} to make. Your book--the poems of Wordsworth, which if you remember I took off your table just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting,</b> and certainly put in my pocket here--" ...|$|R
6000|$|P.S.--I'll {{get this}} to the Abbey with your milk. Can't leave it [...] myself, as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> for town at half-past seven to-morrow [...] morning to catch the early train.|$|E
60|$|GERALD. My dear mother. Do let us wait {{a little}} longer. Lord Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great {{surprise}} for you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> for India {{at the end of}} this month.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very glad, too, Mike, for {{otherwise}} I {{should have}} had to buy one, {{and it is likely}} enough that I may want all the money I have, before this campaign that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> upon is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{look as if}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> for {{a picnic}} rather than a journey that will {{last three or four}} days," [...] she said with an attempt at gaiety. [...] "There <b>is</b> one comfort, <b>we</b> shall have nothing to look after {{when we get to the}} end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is {{a horrible}} nuisance," [...] the other replied; [...] "and just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting,</b> too. There <b>is</b> an end of my campaigning for the present. I should not have minded {{if it had been}} a French ball, but to be merely thrown from a horse is disgusting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, Gervaise, {{you will}} not see them ill treated, for I myself heard Ricord, just before <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting,</b> tell the slave overseers that {{so long as the}} rowers did fair work they were not to use their whips, and that only if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in chase of a pirate were they to be urged to their utmost exertions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wife {{shall make}} a stain {{for you as}} soon as she can get the material. There will be no {{difficulty}} about that, for we often dye our burnooses brown, especially when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> on a long journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{different}} world then," [...] she whispered softly. [...] "It was {{a different}} Mr. Burton. You see, since then a curtain has come down. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> a fresh act and I don't think I know you quite so well as I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{before he}} had opened his office, Herbert came to {{me to get a}} manuscript. [...] "Eugene Field has given us one," [...] he urged, [...] "and we want one from you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> a real {{publishing}} house in Chicago and we need your support." ...|$|E
60|$|So we parted, {{it being}} agreed that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to <b>start</b> upon our journey on the {{following}} morning.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> here. <b>Start</b> for Paris tomorrow. All well. Had {{gorgeous}} 4th of July jollification {{yesterday at}} sea.|$|R
6000|$|But we couldn't {{stay out}} there in that mad storm; we should have frozen to death. So we went in again and shut the door, and began to suffer once more and take turns at the break in the window. By and by, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> away from a station where we had stopped a moment, Thompson pranced in cheerily and exclaimed, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} what we had better do," [...] said George, thoughtfully. [...] "Here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> out on {{what may be a}} long journey, with only three dollars in our pockets, and I am not sure but that we ought to go back to town to try to get some more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} gone, Tim," [...] Percy said, {{not wishing to}} hurt the {{attached}} fellow's feelings, by telling {{him that he had}} been forgotten; [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> tomorrow. I will tell you all about it, when we get in. We have been to see Monsieur Gambetta, this morning and, do you know, we met Colonel Tempe last night, and are stopping in his rooms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'REVEREND HEER AND FRIEND QUATERMAIN,--I {{send this}} to bid you farewell, for {{although}} you are English {{and we have}} quarrelled at times, I honour you in my heart. Friend, now that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting,</b> your warning words lie on me like lead, I know not why. But what is done cannot be undone, and I trust that all will come right. If not, {{it is because the}} Good Lord wills it otherwise.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Every {{individual}} {{wants to}} leave a legacy, to be remembered for something positive they have done for their community. Long after I'm dead and gone the DuSable museum will still be here. A lot of black museums have opened up, but we're {{the only one that}} grew out of the indigenous black community. We weren't started by anybody downtown; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>started</b> by ordinary folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] he {{retorted}} in {{the necessity}} he perceived for staying her drooping spirits. [...] "I wouldn't be anywhere else on any account. Isn't it perfectly delicious? It puts me {{in mind of}} that night on the Lake Ontario boat, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> for Montreal. There was {{the same sort of}} red sunset, and the air wasn't a bit softer than this." ...|$|R
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis <b>we</b> <b>were</b> analysing traffic incidents (such as accidents, congestions, heavy snow, etc.) on Slovenian road network, specifically {{we focused}} on incidents on motorways. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> from database of incidents provided by Prometno-informacijski center (Traffic information center) and added information about hourly traffic {{at the moment of}} incident. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> also researching possible correlations between weather and traffic congestions and accidents as well as behaviour of traffic congestion with different structures of traffic (percentage of heavy vehicles) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that will}} be the best way, Desmond. If you have caught any one I will send them back with a guard to the village. No, it would not do for you to move before we come up, for there is no saying what time a {{messenger}} will go along. They may not take the alarm until just as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting,</b> or even until they see which road we are taking. By the way, you may as well take that pair of handcuffs the sergeant has left on the table with you, otherwise if you do get a prisoner you would have to keep your hands on his collar, or he might make a bolt any moment. There is nothing like being on the safe side.|$|E
60|$|The {{spinster}} had, however, rallied considerably; as was proved by {{the increased}} vigour {{and frequency of}} her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs, all which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice, with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocritical--with the slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and station are compelled to show. Who has not seen how women bully women? What tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily repeated shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the tyrants of their sex? Poor victims! But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> from our proposition, which is, that Miss Crawley was always particularly annoying and savage when she was rallying from illness--as they say wounds tingle most when {{they are about to}} heal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} to see the room where we have music?" [...] he said. [...] "It is a fine room for the purpose--we used before the war to have music every Saturday morning, from ten to twelve: and all friends might come. Usually we had fifteen or twenty people. Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> again. I myself enjoy it so much. I am afraid my wife isn't so {{enthusiastic}} as she used to be. I wish something would rouse her up, you know. The war seemed to take her life away. Here in Florence are so many amateurs. Very good indeed. We can have very good chamber-music indeed. I hope it will cheer her up and make her quite herself again. I was away for such long periods, at the front.--And it was not good for her to be alone.--I am hoping now all will be better." ...|$|E
5000|$|One reason Ballou {{claimed to}} get in to the studio side of music was to have [...] "maximum control over Converge's music" [...] he further stated, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> out, {{no one wanted to}} help us anyway, so if we didn't take control, nothing was going to get done." [...] Ballou has claimed to admire {{producers}} such as Ken Andrews, Martin Bisi, Fred Drake, Steve Albini, and Don Zientara.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Jessie Davidson, who {{was seated}} on a log beside her friend. [...] "It is Francois La Certe. He came to our meeting-place in Red River, you know, just after Cuthbert Grant and his men left us, and, hearing that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>starting</b> off to Jack River again, he {{resolved}} to follow. I heard him tell Slowfoot {{to get ready to}} go along with us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "With {{what we know}} today, if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to <b>start</b> {{again with}} a clean slate, how would we design a global {{communications}} infrastructure?" ...|$|R
