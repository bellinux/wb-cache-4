It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil.

500|$|The episode faced {{criticism}} from the crew over its ending using a deus ex machina {{to indicate that the}} Kindred may have been aliens.

He added that the lack of a real connection to the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of catharsis for the viewer. Morgan said that the episode [...] "went too far. At what point do we become unbelievable?" [...] When asked about the similarity between the Kindred and the Amish, series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "they [...] don't watch TV, so I wasn't worried about it".|$|E

[...] Her father added, [...] "It would use all my effort to get her to sit in her car seat, and I'm a pretty big guy, a strong guy. When she was born, we were like, 'Oh my goodness, she has triceps, she has quads hanging off her. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck's</b> going on?' And she was just super strong.

During the programme, she was shown being questioned by Customs Officers at Sydney airport after swabs of her bag and laptop gave positive readings for cocaine and/or methamphetamine. No drugs were found and the officers were able to verify the story with the friend. She was later cleared to enter the country. In describing the event, the Customs officer stated that they, [...] "went and spoke to Rees' travelling companion. Their stories were similar, but not textbook rehearsed, so {{what she was saying}} added up. Even though - to me - it seemed bizarre, the world's a funny place. People do unusual things and that doesn't always mean they're drug couriers, but it was certainly something that had to be investigated thoroughly. And we did and she's gone now, on her way". Speaking to the camera crew outside in the arrivals hall, Rees said [...] "I think I almost just peed my pants, to be honest with you. I'm shocked! I'm from Las Vegas, so you never know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck's</b> going to be around out there!

When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58.

But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck,</b> I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E
500|$|In a DVD {{review for}} the {{individual}} episode DVD release Spongicus, Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said that [...] "In my previous SpongeBob reviews I have commented that series has lost its edge. This offering does nothing to change my opinion. But <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> do I know? Clearly, the show continues to maintain a large following and the franchise is a license to print money for Nickelodeon." [...] The DVD consists of eight episodes and praised the episodes [...] "Not Normal" [...] and [...] "Gone" [...] by describing them [...] "the best episode on the disc" [...] and [...] "a decent episode", respectively. Also from DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan, on the DVD release To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants, said that [...] " [...] a solid collection of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes." [...] He added that [...] "My only serious problem with this set is that it's only eight episodes long; a more complete season-style release would be more efficient. On the technical front everything is fine, with the bright, solid colors of Bikini Bottom shining through clearly and all the dialogue and effects clear and detailed." [...] Sullivan gave the episodes [...] "The Splinter", [...] "Slide Whistle Stooges", and [...] "The Krabby Kronicle" [...] an 8/10 rating, while [...] "Boating Buddies" [...] received the lowest rating with 3/10.|$|E

500|$|In {{their book}} Education in Popular Culture, Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis {{analyzes}} the adult education {{aspects of this}} episode that portrays adult learners as [...] "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. [...] "However," [...] the authors added, [...] "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of {{how he came to}} be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." [...] The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like [...] "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." [...] The authors concluded that the episode [...] "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the curriculum builds on and values their experience." ...|$|E
