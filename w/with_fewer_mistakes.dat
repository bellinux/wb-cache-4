The stage was at the after part of the cabin, and raised about a foot above the deck, and its management had been intrusted to the doctor, who, assisted by Peter Grim, transformed {{that portion of the}} ship into a scene so romantically beautiful that the first sight of it petrified the crew with surprise. But until the curtain should rise all arrangements were carefully concealed from everyone except the dramatis personae. Even the captain and officers were forbidden to peep behind the sail that formed a curtain to the stage, and this secrecy, besides being necessary, was extremely useful, inasmuch as it excited the curiosity of the men and afforded them food for converse and speculation, for a week before the great day arrived.|$|E

'From {{the textual}} point of view, Shelley's works may {{be divided into}} three classes--those {{published}} in his lifetime under his own direction; those also published in his lifetime, but in his absence from the press; and those published after his death. The first class includes [...] "Queen Mab", [...] "The Revolt of Islam", and [...] "Alastor" [...] with its appendages, published in England before his final departure for the continent; and [...] "The Cenci" [...] and [...] "Adonais", printed under his own eye at Leghorn and Pisa respectively. Except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in [...] "The Revolt of Islam" [...] and one crucial passage in [...] "Alastor", these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation; for the Alexandrines now and then left {{in the middle of}} stanzas in [...] "The Revolt of Islam" [...] must remain untouched, as proceeding not from the printer's carelessness but the author's. The second class, poems printed during Shelley's lifetime, but not under his immediate inspection, comprise [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] and [...] "Rosalind and Helen", together with the pieces which accompanied them, [...] "Epipsychidion", [...] "Hellas", and [...] "Swellfoot the Tyrant". The correction of the most important of these, the [...] "Prometheus", was the least satisfactory. Shelley, though speaking plainly to the publisher, rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to Gisborne, the corrector, but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him, [...] "I have received 'Hellas', which is prettily printed, and <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>mistakes</b> than any poem I ever published." [...] This also was probably not without influence on his determination to have [...] "The Cenci" [...] and [...] "Adonais" [...] printed in Italy...Of the third class of Shelley's writings--those which were first published after his death--sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that Trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggerated...The difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive, but literally disiecti membra poetae, scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering. The editors of the Posthumous Poems, moreover, though diligent according to their light, were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as Shelley, hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes. Some few of the manuscripts, indeed, such as those of [...] "The Witch of Atlas", [...] "Julian and Maddalo", and the [...] "Lines at Naples", were beautifully written out for the press in Shelley's best hand, but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription, with disastrous results in several instances. An entire line dropped out of the [...] "Lines at Naples", and although [...] "Julian and Maddalo" [...] was extant in more than one very clear copy, the printed text had several such sense-destroying errors as [...] "least" [...] for [...] "lead".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{dissertation}} is to expand understanding about when, and how, employees share performance-tips [...] that is, when employees will more frequently disclose to their colleagues (in organizationally-targeted or coworker-targeted ways) the new ideas {{that they have}} discovered {{in the process of}} working that improve their work tasks (e. g., ideas that help employees to work faster, more efficiently, <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>mistakes,</b> etc.) for the purpose of helping others in the same job to complete work or solve problems to improve efficiency or quality. Current literature suggests that this is more likely to occur when employees: (1) feel more rather than less obligated toward their organization and (2) believe that sharing performance-tips will benefit, not harm, them.

Thirty EFL students from Mexico aged 10 to 14 years old participated in this study. The following four main questions were addressed: 1 What criteria did the students use to evaluate their peers ' writing? 2. What revisions were made in relation to peer feedback comments? 3. What was the students ' behaviour like during peer feedback conferences? 4. What were the students ' perceived attitudes concerning peer feedback conferences? Each of the 30 students wrote a first and a second draft and then took part in a peer feedback conference. All students were interviewed and asked to rate a story and provide a peer feedback comment for the author during interview. The study found that the EFL students were able to provide comments to their peers ' writing, but only after their third conference were they actually able to provide higher level comments. The majority of students said that they liked peer feedback sessions. The results also indicated that the students needed more practice with their revisions because they did not make a lot of revisions to make their writing clearer <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>mistakes.</b> This study concludes that there still needs to be further research.

40|$|On any {{election}} day, interested citizens want to {{know one}} thing [...] who won. News organizations {{are in the business}} of getting accurate results to !heir audience as quickly as possible. but counting actual votes takes hours, and sometimes days. Beginning in the early 1960 s, news organizations developed ways of projecting the outcome of races in order to speed the process of reporting before votes were actually counted. They began to develop methods and systems of modeling and polling that could indicate, statistically, the likely winner in any given race. The motive was to give the audience what it wanted [...] the faster, the better. Of course, the news media intended to make their projections as accurate as possible. In time, polling and analysis became increasingly sophisticated. Results from preelection samples, along with extrapolations from precinct models, exit polls. and partial election returns, were combined into what I will refer to as the networks' election-day polling and projection system. This system provided the basis for making election projections faster and better, meaning <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Year after year, the systems were improved, spurred on by competition among the news organizations to be the first to report outcomes to their audiences. Not incidentally, the highly competitive polling and projection business grew increasingly costly. In 1990. the first network pool for exit polling and projections, Voter Research and Surveys (VRS), was formed with the intention to meet the increasing costs and share expenses. Cost sharing made it possible for the networks to provide the greatest sweep of polling. Without the pool, the networks would have had to restrict their reach and coverage because of budget limitations. Of course, in journalistic terms, pooling meant the information would be less re liable. While the networks could, by combining resources, undertake larger polling operations and more sophisticated modeling that could reduce the risk of certain types of error, the vulnerability of the networks to any errors that did result was increased. When data are wrong, with only one source of information, there is no opportunity for correction. Nevertheless, financial considerations trumped reliability [...] and the best practices of journalism. By election day 2000, after several permutations, a comprehensive polling and projection system was in place backed by a consortium of five television networks and the Associated Press. Its purpose was to collect and disseminate polling data and voting information by which news organizations could make their independent calls, maintaining an element of competition among them. In thinking about this system in its entirety, we must consider not only the Voter News Service (VNS), the reconstituted consortium operation, but also the analysis and reporting operations of the separate networks as well. The system was economical. and it was fast. But was it accurate? The answer: not as accurate or as reliable as it was intended, promised, or needed to be, especially when it came to calling a very close race. We learned that answer on election night 2000. At the core of the reporting problem were two mistaken projections in one state, Florida, which turned out to be key to the outcome of the national election. The television networks and other news outlets twice projected the winner and twice recalled those projections. News executives, particularly television news executives, as well as editors, correspondents, and producers themselves described election-night coverage as a "debacle," a "disaster," and a "fiasco. " Something had gone wrong [...] terribly wrong [...] in the polling and projection system. It is not the purpose of this article to ferret out the exact sources of the errors on that night. The experiences of election night 2000 do, however, serve as a useful lens through which to examine the overall efficacy of the system that was in place. It is my contention that this system is too fraught with the potential for error for news organizations to rely on its projections in the way that they have in the recent past...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} teaching in which the learners are consistent and have bounded state, but are otherwise arbitrary. The teacher is non-interactive and “massively open”: the teacher broadcasts a sequence of examples of an arbitrary target concept, intended for every possible on-line learning algorithm to learn from. We focus {{on the problem of}} designing interesting teachers: efficient sequences of examples that lead all capable and consistent learners to learn concepts, regardless of the underlying algorithm used by the learner. We use two measures of teaching efficiency: the number of mistakes made by the worst-case learner, and the maximum length of the example sequence needed for the worst-case learner. Our results are summarized as follows: • Given a uniform random sequence of examples of an n-bit concept function, learners (capable of consistently learning the concept) with s(n) bits of state are guaranteed to make only O(n · s(n)) mistakes and exactly learn the concept, with high probability. This theorem has interesting corollaries; for instance, every concept c has a sequence of examples can teach c to all capable consistent on-line learners implementable with s(n) -size circuits, such that every learner makes only Õ(s(n) 2) mistakes. That is, all resourcebounded algorithms capable of consistently learning a concept can be simultaneously taught that concept <b>with</b> <b>few</b> <b>mistakes,</b> on a single example sequence. We also show how to efficiently generate such a sequence of examples on-line: using Nisan’s pseudorandom generator, each example in the sequence can be generated with polynomial-time overhead per example, with an O(n · s(n)) bit initial seed...|$|R

CPDLC is a data link application that allows for the direct exchange of text-based messages between a controller and a pilot.

As traffic volume in the airspace becomes saturated, {{it is necessary to}} adopt CPDLC as the primary communication method and air traffic controllers should be trained accordingly. In the presented work, the features of CPDLC are introduced as well as the structure of CPDLC system is illustrated, and a novel framework for training air traffic controller with CPDLC system is proposed. It is seen that air traffic controller can be trained <b>with</b> lower workload, <b>fewer</b> <b>mistakes</b> and more flexibility using CPDLC system...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{up-to-date}} road {{information is}} essential for both effective urban planning and disaster management. Today, very high resolution (VHR) imagery acquired by airborne and spaceborne imaging sensors is the primary source for the acquisition of spatial information of increasingly growing road networks. Given the increased availability of the aerial and satellite images, {{it is necessary to}} develop computer-aided techniques to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of road extraction tasks. Therefore, automation of image-based road extraction is a very active research topic. This thesis deals with the development and implementation aspects of a semi-automatic road extraction strategy, which includes two key approaches: multidirectional and single-direction road extraction. It requires a human operator to initialize a seed circle on a road and specify a extraction approach before the road is extracted by automatic algorithms using multiple vision cues. The multidirectional approach is used to detect roads with different materials, widths, intersection shapes, and degrees of noise, but sometimes it also interprets parking lots as road areas. Different from the multidirectional approach, the single-direction approach can detect roads <b>with</b> <b>few</b> <b>mistakes,</b> but each seed circle can only be used to detect one road. In accordance with this strategy, a RoadModeler prototype was developed. Both aerial and GeoEye- 1 satellite images of seven different types of scenes with various road shapes in rural, downtown, and residential areas were used to evaluate the performance of the RoadModeler. The experimental results demonstrated that the RoadModeler is reliable and easy-to-use by a non-expert operator. Therefore, the RoadModeler is much better than the object-oriented classification. Its average road completeness, correctness, and quality achieved 94 %, 97 %, and 94 %, respectively. These results are higher than those of Hu et al. (2007), which are 91 %, 90 %, and 85 %, respectively. The successful development of the RoadModeler suggests that the integration of multiple vision cues potentially offers a solution to simple and fast acquisition of road information. Recommendations are given for further research to be conducted to ensure that this progress goes beyond the prototype stage and towards everyday use...|$|R
