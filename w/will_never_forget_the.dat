25|$|Bobby Simpson was a {{physically}} compact, highly accomplished batsman with a striking penchant for compiling high scores...He was a pleasant, personable cricketer, and a captain with genuine feeling for his players.

25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, {{could not think of}} a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E

We will always demand revenge for him inside America and outside." [...] Hakimullah Mehsud replaced his cousin Baitullah Mehsud as the chief of the Tehrik-i-Taliban after Baitullah was killed by a U.S. drone attack. Al-Balawi's father confirmed that the video showed his son.|$|E
5000|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Gaye's death were shock {{on the part}} of many of his peers.

500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It {{opens with a}} female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is {{an electronic}} introduction. This {{is followed by the}} sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> moment". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped me make the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, but hey, you win some and you lose some." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, Sacramento County {{improved}} the county road along the levee of the Sacramento River between Sacramento and Rio Vista, which crossed the river twice on free ferries near Paintersville and Isleton. A toll ferry across the San Joaquin River connected Sherman Island, south of Rio Vista, with Antioch, where drivers could head west through the Broadway Tunnel {{to reach the}} San Francisco Bay, but the road between Rio Vista and the ferry was poor. In 1922, the Victory Highway Association selected this [...] "Netherlands Route" [...] (through what was locally promoted as the [...] "Netherlands of America") for the Victory Highway west of Sacramento, as it was both shorter than the Lincoln Highway route via Stockton and more scenic. In particular, the river district would [...] "impress [...] with the enormous productive resources of this state as well as supply him with an unmatched scenic drive", and the Broadway Tunnel approach to the bay would bring him [...] "over the Victory Highway {{to the end of}} his journey in such a fashion that he <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> view spread before him as he first comes into sight of the San Francisco Bay region".|$|E

2500|$|Olympio {{broke his}} silence, {{which was the}} subject of much speculation, in a letter {{published}} on 21 February. In that letter, he expressed confidence in Fabre and told his supporters: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> moments of enthusiasm and confidence you have always shown in all circumstances, and I thank you forever." [...] In a radio interview on 23 February, however, he stressed that he was still in charge of the UFC. Regarding his delayed and arguably unenthusiastic endorsement of Fabre, he said that it had been necessary to consult with other political actors before backing Fabre, and he pointed to his health as the reason he was unable to accompany Fabre on the campaign trail.|$|E

2500|$|A search {{party of}} more than thirty men looked for the {{children}} throughout the afternoon and evening. They {{had to give up}} when it grew dark, but set out again the next morning. When they finally found the children, it was two o'clock in the afternoon on March 16, twenty-five hours since the children had first set out from the school house. The overturned sleigh, with the horse still hitched up to it, was resting in a coulee two miles south of the school. [...] "With breathless haste we harried to the rig and <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> sight that met our eyes," [...] one of the men reported. The searchers found the rigid Hazel lying over her siblings, covering them with her body. Her coat, which she had unbuttoned, was spread over the bodies of the two younger children and her arms were stretched out over them. Beneath her, still alive, were Emmet and Myrdith. [...] "Maude," [...] the old horse, was standing beside the overturned sled, also still alive. If the horse had moved, the three children would have been tipped into the snow.|$|E

In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said [...] "I thank Rosie {{from the bottom of my}} heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day.

I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all." [...] O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: [...] "I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me—I wish the show was able to attract more viewers—but it did not. So I am headed back to my home in New York—with gratitude. On we go!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilgamesh {{observes that}} Utnapishtim seems no {{different}} from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Ea told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with pitch and bitumen. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and [...] "all the animals of the field". A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which [...] "all the human beings turned to clay". Utnapishtim weeps {{when he sees the}} destruction. His boat lodges on a mountain, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she will always remember this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Ea also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account matches the flood story that concludes the Epic of Atra-Hasis (see also Gilgamesh flood myth).|$|E
