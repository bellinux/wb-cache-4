The aquatic plant Schoenoplectus gemmifer is an endangered species endemic to Japan. Our previous study reported that the population size of S. gemmifer in Hamamatsu city, Japan, had decreased by one-tenth because many individuals had been washed out {{by a series of}} heavy rains in 2004. However, there is insufficient information on the ecological nature of this endangered aquatic plant for adequate conservation. In this paper, we report the population dynamics of one population in Hamamatsu city from 2004 to 2012 in relation to rainfall. We surveyed the number and growing location of all living individuals in the population 300 times during the study period. To examine the temporal changes of individual plants, we also counted the number of culms for 38 individuals in four observations among 300 records. Decreases and increases in the population size of this plant were associated with washing out and the settlement of gemmae (vegetative propagation), respectively. The major cause of the reduction in the population size was {{an increase in the number}} of washed-out individuals and not the decreased settlement of gemmae. The <b>wash-out</b> <b>rates</b> for small and large individuals were not significantly different. Small individuals having a stream form with linear leaves resisted flooding, and large individuals were often partially torn off by flooding events.

Materials and Methods This multicenter prospective study included patients who received first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. Tumor enhancement measured using CEUS within one liver metastasis and in relation to the surrounding healthy liver was quantified within 8 days before the first infusion of bevacizumab (E 0), 24 hours {{after the end of the}} first infusion of bevacizumab (E 1), in the 24 hours before the 2 nd and 3  rd infusion of bevacizumab on day 15 (E 2) and day 30 (E 3), respectively, and after 2 months of treatment (E 4). Endpoints were tumor response using RECIST criteria at 2 months, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Among the 137 patients included in this study, 109 were analyzed. Only CEUS parameters calculated in relation to healthy liver were significant. High wash-in and <b>wash-out</b> <b>rates</b> at baseline were significantly associated with a better tumor response. Increases over time E 2 -E 0 and E 3 -E 0 for peak enhancement were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival.

Here, we present a diagnostics package, implemented in the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy), which keeps track of the contribution of source categories (mainly emission sectors) to various concentrations. The diagnostics package is implemented as a submodel (TAGGING) of EMAC (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts – Hamburg (ECHAM) /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). It determines the contributions of 10 different source categories to the concentration of ozone, nitrogen oxides, peroxyacytyl nitrate, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, hydroxyl, and hydroperoxyl radicals ([*]=[*] tagged tracers). The source categories are mainly emission sectors and some other sources for completeness. As emission sectors, road traffic, shipping, air traffic, anthropogenic non-traffic, biogenic, biomass burning, and lightning are considered. The submodel obtains information on the chemical reaction rates, online emissions, such as lightning, and <b>wash-out</b> <b>rates.</b> It then solves differential equations for the contribution of a source category to each of the seven tracers.

30|$|From a {{biological}} {{point of view}} and real condition, if the concentration of the microorganism in the culture vessel is large but the <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> is too small, it will affect the growth of the microorganism in the turbidostat. On the contrary, if the concentration of the microorganism is quite small, the fixed <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> will cause the waste of the nutrient. Based on the above phenomenon, we construct a turbidostat model with linear <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> d+kx(t). Due to the stochastic destabilizations, the maximum growth rate, one of the essential parameters in microorganism cultivation, will undergo variations at different times in the turbidostat. That is, if the birth (death) rate increases (decreases) or the temperature and food are sufficient, the maximum growth rate occurs in advance. If the birth (death) rate decreases (increases) or the temperature and food are insufficient in the system, the maximum growth rate delays. Therefore, the maximum growth rate undergoes a random change.|$|E

WO–WI time constant difference was greater during EE imaging, smaller tidal volumes, and with higher Xe concentrations. Regional perfusion did not correlate with WI–WO.

At low dilution rates all three strains utilised glucose oxidatively with high biomass yield coefficients, no ethanol production and very low steady-state residual glucose concentrations in the culture. Above a threshold dilution rate, respiro-fermentative (oxido-reductive) metabolism commenced, with simultaneous respiration and fermentation occurring, which is typical of Crabtree-positive yeasts. However, at high dilution rates the three strains responded differently. At high dilution rates S. cerevisiae CBS 8066 produced 7 – 8 [*]g ethanol L− 1 from 20 [*]g glucose L− 1 with concomitant low levels of residual glucose, which increased markedly only close to the <b>wash-out</b> dilution <b>rate.</b> By contrast, in the respiro-fermentative region both S. cerevisiae ATCC 4126 and NRRL Y 132 produced much lower levels of ethanol (3 – 4 [*]g[*]L− 1) than S. cerevisiae CBS 8066, concomitant with very high residual sugar concentrations, which was a significant deviation from Monod kinetics {{and appeared to be}} associated either with high growth rates or with a fermentative (or respiro-fermentative) metabolism.

40|$|PURPOSE: Cardiac {{amyloidosis}} {{is a rare}} disorder, but it {{may lead}} to potentially life-threatening restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac manifestations frequently occur in primary amyloidosis (AL) and familial amyloidosis (ATTR), but are uncommon in secondary amyloidosis (AA). Echocardiography is the method of choice for assessing cardiac amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits impair the function of sympathetic nerve endings. Disturbance of myocardial sympathetic innervations may {{play an important role}} in the remodelling process. (123) I-MIBG can detect these innervation changes. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven amyloidosis underwent general work-up, echocardiography and (123) I-MIBG scintigraphy. Left ventricular internal dimensions and wall thickness were measured, and highly refractile cardiac echoes (sparkling) were analysed. Early (15 min) and late (4 h) heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) and <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> were determined after administration of MIBG. RESULTS: Included in the study were 61 patients (30 women and 31 men; mean age 62 years; 39 AL, 11 AA, 11 ATTR). Echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between the groups. Sparkling was present in 72 % of ATTR patients, in 54 % of AL patients and in 45 % of AA patients. Mean late HMR in all patients was 2. 3 ± 0. 75, and the mean <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> was 8. 6 ± 14 % (the latter not significantly different between the patient groups). Late HMR was significantly lower in patients with echocardiographic signs of amyloidosis than in patients without (2. 0 ± 0. 70 versus 2. 8 ± 0. 58, p < 0. 001). Wash-out rates were significantly higher in these patients (- 3. 3 ± 9. 9 % vs. 17 ± 10 %, p < 0. 001). In ATTR patients without echocardiographic signs of amyloidosis, HMR was lower than in patients with the other types (2. 0 ± 0. 59 vs. 2. 9 ± 0. 50, p = 0. 007). CONCLUSION: MIBG HMR is lower and <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> is higher in patients with echocardiographic signs of amyloidosis.

By contrast, strain CBS 8066 exhibited much lower steady-state residual glucose concentrations in this region. Glucose transport assays were conducted with these strains to determine the relationship between transport kinetics and sugar assimilation. With strain CBS 8066, a high-affinity glucose uptake system was evident up to a dilution rate of 0. 41 h− 1, with a low-affinity uptake system and high residual glucose levels only evident at the higher dilution rates. With strain ATCC 4126, the high-affinity uptake system was present up to a dilution rate of about 0. 38 h− 1, but a low-affinity uptake system was discerned already from a dilution rate of 0. 27 h− 1, which coincided with the sharp increase in the residual glucose concentration.

We write the density matrix equation, describing {{the generation of}} the matter-antimatter asymmetry, for an arbitrary choice of the right-handed (RH) neutrino masses. For hierarchical RH neutrino masses lying in the fully flavoured regimes, this reduces to multiple-stage Boltzmann equations. In this case we recover and extend results previously derived within a quantum state collapse description. We confirm the generic existence of phantom terms. However, {{taking into account the}} effect of gauge interactions, we show that they are washed out at the production with a <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> that is halved compared to that one acting on the total asymmetry. In the N_ 1 -dominated scenario they cancel without contributing to the final baryon asymmetry. In other scenarios they do not in general {{and they have to be}} taken into account.

40|$|External beam {{radiotherapy}} {{is one of}} {{the standard}} radical treatment options for men with clinically localized prostate cancer, being still the most common non-skin malignancy as well as the third cause of cancer-related mortality in men in developed countries. Despite technical advances in the field of radiation delivery and treatment planning, the rate of biochemical and clinical failure for these patients is still significant. New strategies to increase the therapeutic index, determined by the balance between tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability, are therefore warranted. Since local tumor control after curative radiotherapy is influenced by several factors, such as the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumor cells as well as adequate tumor targeting, two important means to improve the radiocurability for prostate cancer were studied in this dissertation: radiosensitizers that could attenuate the radioresistance of tumor cells and MR imaging techniques which could improve the accuracy of intra-prostatic tumor detection and localization, thereby allowing more adequate tumor targeting. In {{the first part of this}} work we explored the combination of radiotherapy with several molecular targeted agents (MTA) that could selectively enhance the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (i. e. radiosensitizers) in human prostate cancer cells. In order to achieve complete tumor control, all clonogenic cells capable of tumor regrowth should be eradicated, which depends on the sensitivity of these cells to killing by ionizing radiation. The combination of MTA with radiotherapy aims to modify the cellular response to radiotherapy by interfering with any cancer-related process which induces or supports radioresistance. Moreover, normal tissue toxicity should be minimal, since the molecular target proteins are often differentially expressed between tumor and normal cells. More specifically, the in vitro effects of three MTA on the radiosensitivity of both androgen-responsive (22 Rv 1) and androgen-irresponsive (PC 3, DU 145) human prostate cancer cells were investigated. Each of these agents acts on a different process relevant to the response to ionizing radiation: energy metabolism, mitogenic signaling and cell adhesion. The effect of every agent on cell proliferation and cell survival was determined using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay and a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, respectively. Trypan blue exclusion assays were also performed in this context. The radiosensitizing capacity was tested using colony formation assays. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were used to detect the expression level as well as the activation status of relevant proteins. Experiments to unravel the exact radiosensitization mechanism of these MTA included detection of apoptosis, determination of cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species production, double strand break (DSB) repair, etc. Transfectionexperiments with siRNA or plasmid DNA were used to determine the relative importance of key molecules in the radiosensitization effect of the agents being investigated. The first drug that was tested, was the low energy-mimetic and AMPK agonist AICAR that can affect the malignant phenotype by diminishing cancer cell anabolism. By doing so, we hypothesized that it could also enhance the cellular response to radiotherapy, which would effectively increase the dose-related effectiveness of AICAR. Incubation of PC 3 human prostate cancer cells with AICAR inhibited cell proliferation and decreased viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and sensitized them to ionizing radiation. Radiosensitization, however, did not correspond to the time- and dose-dependent activation pattern of AMPK. The AMPK independence of radiosensitization by AICAR was confirmed by the finding that siRNA knock down of AMPK also radiosensitized cells and synergized with AICAR. Drug agonist and antagonists showed that imbalanced deoxynucleotide pools due to ZMP accumulation after AICAR administration were involved in the radiosensitizing mechanism. Our findings on the favorable interaction between low doses of AICAR and ionizing radiation open new perspectives for the clinical use of this compound at relatively low doses that may minimize potential toxicities. Second, we explored the effect of the IGF- 1 R small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW 541 (Novartis) on the intrinsic radioresistance of prostate cancer cells. Although the important role of IGF- 1 R signaling in malignant transformation, progression and therapy resistance is well established, studies investigating the combination of IGF- 1 R targeted agents in combination with radiotherapy are relatively limited. Here, we showed that NVP-AEW 541 inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell viability in a time-and dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines. Radiosensitization, however, was observed in the PTEN wild-type cell lines DU 145 and 22 Rv 1, but not in the PTEN-deficient PC 3 cell line. NVP-AEW 541 -induced radiosensitization coincided with downregulation of phospho-Akt levels and high levels of residual DSB. Transfection of the PTEN wild-type cells DU 145 and 22 Rv 1 with a constitutively active or a kinase-death form of Akt, attenuated or enhanced the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AEW 541, respectively. This demonstrated the importance of the PTEN status in the NVP-AEW 541 induced radiosensitization effect. Therefore, we believe that proper patient selection based on the PTEN status of the tumor will be critical in order to achieve optimal results in clinical trials in which the combination of radiotherapy and this IGF- 1 R inhibitor is being explored. At last, we tested the capacity of the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor Nilotinib, being used as an inhibitor of the cell adhesion receptor DDR 1 , to interfere with the process of cell adhesion-mediated radioresistance. We showed that DDR 1 was activated in all cell lines. Incubation with nilotinib inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cells grown on collagen I-coated flasks however were more resistant to nilotinib. Nilotinib treatment increased the radiosensitivity of the DU 145 cells, but this effect was attenuated by collagen I stimulation. These results were in line with the expression profile of phospho-DDR 1 after treatment with nilotinib and/or ionizing radiation. Similar effects on radiosensitivity were observed after siRNA targeting of DDR 1. Our data thus demonstrated that DDR 1 inhibition can induce radiosensitization in some prostate cancer cell lines, but collagen I can abolish this effect. This stresses the importance of the tumor cell microenvironment in mediating cellular radiosensitivity after targeted treatment. The second aim of this project was to evaluate different functional MRI techniques that could improve the detection and localization accuracy of tumor lesions within the prostate gland. While conventional T 2 w MRI mainly provides anatomical images, functional MRI modalities allow the spatial assessment of different physiological tissue characteristics, like perfusion (DCE MRI) or diffusion (DW MRI). The combination of both anatomical and physiological information should enable more accurate detection, localization and characterization of intra-prostatic tumor nodules, which is an indispensable prerequisite if one aims to escalate the radiation dose only to the intra-prostatic tumour regions. Such approach is an alternative to dose-escalation to the entire prostate, which is limited due to normal tissue toxicity. In the first study, 53 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were examined by DCE-MRI at 1. 5 T. Cancerous and benign regions were delineated based on the histopathology of whole-mount sections and the accuracy of different semi-quantitative DCE MRI parameters to discriminate between cancerous and benign prostatic tissue was assessed. Within individual patients, a consistently higher Cpeak (maximal contrast enhancement) and faster Wash-in (speed of contrast uptake) were present in cancerous compared to benign prostatic tissue. Both the TTP (time to peak) and the <b>Wash-out</b> (contrast clearance <b>rate)</b> occurred more rapidly in tumor tissue than in normal prostatic tissue. Despite a considerable inter-patient overlap of parameter values between tumor and normal prostatic tissue, area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis demonstrated that for the Wash-in a good sensitivity and specificity could be reached (AUC 0. 82). Combination of the Wash-in and the Wash-out proved to be even more accurate to discriminate cancerous from benign prostatic tissue (AUC 0. 87). These data showed that semi-quantitative parameters can be used for the identification of intra-prostatictumor nodules, with the Wash-in being the most accurate discriminator between malignant and benign prostatic tissue. In the second study in which 49 patients were enrolled, we prospectively evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of three MRI techniques or any combination of those to detect and localize intra-prostatic tumor nodules, i. e. T 2 w MRI, DCE MRI and DW MRI. This study demonstrated that the combination of T 2 W, DCE and DW MRI significantly improved prostate cancer detection and localization, irrespective of the reader experience. DW MRI had the highest sensitivity, but this could significantly be improved by the addition of T 2 w and DCE MRI information. Moreover, our results indicated that tumor volume could most accurately be assessed by means of DW MRI. Multi-modality MR imaging has thus the potential to guide focal escalation radiotherapy for prostate cancer. In conclusion, this work showed that both radiosensitization and multi-modality MR imaging could contribute to an improved radiocurability for patients with localized prostate cancer.

30|$|The {{ecological}} {{implications of}} the strong wash-out conditions on the microbial community are not yet fully understood, despite {{being one of the}} strongest selective forces applied in SBRs for aerobic granulation. It has been shown that the <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> of different bacterial groups can be different, depending on their spatial distribution within the granule (Winkler et al. 2012). Bacterial populations growing {{on the surface of the}} granules may be eroded and washed out in higher numbers than bacteria growing deeper in the granule. Thus, bacterial groups situated in the exterior layer of the granules are likely to contribute more to the suspended solids content in the effluent than bacteria situated in the interior layer. However, if a granule breaks up, exterior and interior bacterial populations will be washed out equally, presuming that the particles are not too dense. The density of the broken granule particle depends on the type(s) of bacteria it is comprised of (Gonzalez-Gil and Holliger 2014), and on the predominant granulation mechanisms—self-aggregation of floccular biomass, self-aggregation of small granules (microcolony aggregation), microcolony outgrowth, or attachment of floccular biomass to granular biomass (Barr et al. 2010; Verawaty et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2014). Depending on process conditions and the bacteria dominating the microbial community, different granulation mechanisms were reported to prevail (Weissbrodt et al. 2013).|$|E

Thirty-five patients with morphologically proved thyroid nodules (17 malignant; 18 benign), underwent CEUS examination. Five enhancement patterns were evaluated: vascularisation, homogeneity, presence of peripheral rim type enhancement, <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> of the contrast medium, and enhancement using microvascular imaging application. Time-intensity curves (TIC) were analysed in post-processing and defined as three types: slow versus rapid and stable versus rapid biphasic wash-out. Diagnostic value of the listed CEUS parameters was calculated. The results showed medium strength correlation between morphology (benign versus malignant nodule) and type of TIC curve rs = 0. 38 (p = 0. 021), as well as between mode of contrast enhancement rs = 0. 39 (p = 0. 022) and wash-out pattern rs = 0. 39 (p = 0. 024). The overall pooled sensitivity of selected diagnostic parameters was 82 %, specificity 57 %, and accuracy 70 %. Malignant nodules were characterised by iso- or hypovascular contrast enhancement and slow wash-out, while benign nodules showed hypervascular enhancement with rapid wash-out TIC curve and rim-like pattern. The CEUS patterns significantly differed between malignant and benign thyroid nodules with high diagnostic accuracy. Thus, CEUS has important clinical value as an additional tool to ultrasound and fine needle biopsy...|$|E

Contrast enhanced ultrasonography imaging of the Internal Jugular Vein was performed in fifty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis, seven clinically isolated syndrome patients and in thirteen healthy controls. Time-intensity curves were quantified using a semi-automated method and compared with clinical disease outcomes. Wash-out parameters were calculated and six Time-intensity curves shapes were created. Significantly reduction of <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> in Internal Jugular Veins was detected in Multiple Sclerosis patients compared to healthy controls [22. 2 % (2. 7 %– 65. 9 %) vs. 33. 4 % (16. 2 %– 76. 8 %); P, 0. 005]. Internal Jugular Vein enhancement was heterogeneous in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and consisted of slow wash-out Time-intensity curves shapes, compared with almost only one type of Time-intensity curves shape in control subjects that correspond to fast enhancement and fast wash-out. The vein wash-in parameters were similar in Multiple Sclerosis group compared with controls. A significant correlation was found between Internal Jugular Vein wash-out and level of disability (R = 20. 402, p, 0. 05).

40|$|Cardiac {{sympathetic}} nerve activity is changed {{in patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, the relationship between heterogeneity of this activity and systolic left ventric-ular dysfunction in patients with HCM is not well established. This study was performed to evaluate the {{sympathetic nerve}} activity in various cardiac regions and to investigate the rela-tionship between cardiac dysfunction and heterogeneity of the cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in patients with HCM. Meth-ods: Cardiac sympathetic nerve activity was evaluated in 25 patients with HCM and 10 control subjects using planar imaging and SPECT by 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocar-dial scintigraphy. With planar 123 I-MIBG imaging, the heart-to-mediastinum activity ratios (H/M), at early (20 min) and delayed (3 h) acquisition, and the washout rate were calculated. Polar maps of the left ventricular myocardium were divided into 20 segments, and the dispersion (maximal to minimal values) and SD of uptake and the washout rate in 20 segments were calcu-lated. Results: The early H/M did not differ between the 2 groups. The delayed H/M was significantly lower and the <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> of the whole heart was significantly higher in the HCM group {{than those in the}} control group. In patients with HCM, the delayed H/M, early uptake dispersion, and SD of early uptake showed good correlation with the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and the percentage of fractional shortening. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the SD of early uptake was a powerful determinant for the percentage of fractional shortening in patients with HCM. Conclusion: These results suggest that the heterogeneity of regional cardiac sympathetic nerve activity may be correlated with cardiac dys-function in patients with HCM...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the cardiac sympathetic function in panic dis-order using 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123 I-MIBG). Meth-ods: Myocardial imaging using 123 I-MIBG was performed on 9 patients with panic disorder (7 men, 2 women; mean age, 37. 4 13. 2 y) and 11 control subjects (11 men; mean age, 37. 6 9. 3 y). Early (30 min) and delayed (4 h) planar images were taken after the injection of 111 MBq 123 I-MIBG. The mean counts in the whole heart and the mediastinum were obtained from the early and delayed images to calculate the heart-to-mediastinum count ratios (H/M ratios) and the myocardial <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: The 123 I-MIBG H/M ratios of the patients with panic disorder were 1. 80 0. 16 for the early images and 1. 86 0. 30 for the delayed images, which were significantly lower than those of the control subjects (2. 15 0. 15 [P 0. 001] and 2. 26 0. 21 [P 0. 009], respectively). The 123 I-MIBG washout rate from the heart in the patients with panic disorder (33. 8 % 6. 9 %) was significantly higher than that in the control subjects (27. 8 % 3. 5 %) (P 0. 02). Conclusion: 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy demonstrated impairment of cardiac sympathetic function in panic disorder.

40|$|In dynamic cardiac SPECT {{estimates}} of kinetic parameters of a one-compartment perfusion model are usually obtained in a two step process: 1) first a MAP iterative algorithm, which properly models the Poisson statistics and {{the physics of}} the data acquisition, reconstructs a sequence of dynamic reconstructions, 2) then kinetic parameters are estimated from time activity curves generated from the dynamic reconstructions. This paper provides a method for calculating the covariance matrix of the kinetic parameters, which are determined using weighted least squares fitting that incorporates the estimated variance and covariance of the dynamic reconstructions. For each transaxial slice sets of sequential tomographic projections are reconstructed into a sequence of transaxial reconstructions usingfor each reconstruction in the time sequence an iterative MAP reconstruction to calculate the maximum a priori reconstructed estimate. Time-activity curves for a sum of activity in a blood region inside the left ventricle and a sum in a cardiac tissue region are generated. Also, curves for the variance of the two {{estimates of}} the sum and for the covariance between the two ROI estimates are generated {{as a function of}} time at convergence using an expression obtained from the fixed-point solution of the statistical error of the reconstruction. A one-compartment model is fit to the tissue activity curves assuming a noisy blood input function to give weighted least squares estimates of blood volume fraction, wash-in and <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> constants specifying the kinetics of 99 mTc-teboroxime for the leftventricular myocardium. Numerical methods are used to calculate the second derivative of the chi-square criterion to obtain estimates of the covariance matrix for the weighted least square parameter estimates.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the significance of}} exercise-induced ST segment changes assumed to relate with the residual viable myocardium in myocardial infarction, we performed exercise Tl- 201 myocardial scintigraphy, coronary arteriography and left ventriculography in 30 patients (pts) with myocardial infarction attributed to one vessel disease. The myocardial ischemia was evaluated by the following parameters; as the parameter of ischemia in the infarct and/or periinfarct area, Σredistribution score (ΣRS) {{was obtained from the}} area between exercise- and 3 hrs-circumferential profiles for 3 views (Ant, LAO- 45, Lt-lat); as the parameter of ischemia in the infarct area, <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> (W-O Rate) was obtained from ROI set on the infarct area. Results were as follows; 1) prevalence of abnormal ΣRS were 22 % (2 / 9) in pts group without ST segment changes (group 1), 82 % (9 / 11) in pts group with ST segment depression (group 2) and 60 % (6 / 10) in pts group with ST segment elevation (group 3). 2) prevalence of delayed W-O Rate were 0 % (0 / 9) in group 1, 73 % (8 / 11) in group 2 and 40 % (4 / 10) in group 3. 3) collateral vessels supplying the infarct area were present in 0 % (0 / 9) of group 1, 100 % (11 / 11) of group 2 and 70 % (7 / 10) of group 3. 4) in group 3, 67 % (4 / 6) of pts without delayed W-O Rate and 50 % (2 / 4) of pts with delayed W-O Rate had dyskinesis or aneurysm at resting left ventriculography.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the use of the noradrenaline analogue iodine- 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine ([123 I]MIBG) for the assessment of cardiac sympathetic activity in the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension in animal models. One model used Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) rendered diabetic at 12 weeks of age by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The other model used lean and obese Zucker rats. In all groups basic haemodynamic values were established and animals received an intravenous injection of 50 microCi [123 I]MIBG. Initial myocardial uptake and wash-out rates of [123 I]MIBG were measured scintigraphically during 4 h. After sacrifice, plasma noradrenaline and left cardiac ventricular beta-adrenoceptor density was determined. The diabetic state, both in STZ-treated rats (direct induction) and in obese Zucker rats (genetic induction), appeared to induce a lower cardiac density of beta-adrenoceptors, indicative of increased sympathetic activity. Cardiac [123 I]MIBG then showed increased wash-outs, thereby confirming enhanced noradrenergic activity. This parallism of results led to the conclusion that [123 I]MIBG wash-out measurements could provide an excellent tool to assess cardiac sympathetic activity non-invasively. However, in hypertension (WKY vs SHR), both parameters failed to show parallelism: no changes in beta-adrenoceptor density were found, whereas [123 I]MIBG <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> was increased. Thus, either [123 I]MIBG washout or beta-adrenoceptor density may not be a reliable parameter under all circumstances to detect changes in the release of noradrenaline. Changes in the initial uptake of [123 I]MIBG were observed as well. This may be a good marker for the disappearance of cardiac innervation, but it seems not to be a good parameter for distinguishing between loss of sympathetic innervation and enhanced uptake of noradrenaline in pathological condition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR), {{which may}} be due to the over expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and/or MRP, is a major problem in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of osteosarcoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Tc- 99 m MIBI scan for predicting the response to pre-operative chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients (12 males and 13 females, aged between 8 and 52 y) with osteosarcoma were studied. Before the chemotherapy, planar 99 mTc-MIBI anterior and posterior images were obtained 10 -min [tumor-to-background ratio: (T 1 /B 1) 10 min] and 3 -hr after tracer injection. After completion of chemotherapy, again 99 mTc-MIBI scan was performed at 10 -min after tracer injection. In addition to calculation of decay corrected tumor to background (T/B) ratios, using the 10 -min and 3 -hr images of the pre-chemotherapy scintigraphy, percent <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> (WR%) of 99 mTc-MIBI was calculated. Using the 10 -min images of the pre- and post-chemotherapy scans, the percent reduction in uptake at the tumor site after treatment (Red%) was also calculated. Then after surgical resection, tumor response was assessed by percentage of necrosis. Results: All patients showed significant 99 mTc-MIBI uptake in early images. Only 9 patients showed good response to chemotherapy (necrosis≥ 90 %) while 16 patients were considered as non-responder (necrosis< 90 %). There was no statistical significant difference between non-responders and responders in (T 1 /B 1) 10 min. There was a significant negative correlation between WR% and percentage of necrosis (P= 0. 001).

Zhao and Yuan [13] formulated a single-species stochastic chemostat model with periodic coefficients due to seasonal fluctuation; they obtained sufficient conditions for the existence of a random positive periodic solution and a globally attractive condition of the random periodic solution. Wang et al.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the dynamic {{distribution}} of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in malignant and in infectious lesions. METHODS: The dynamic distribution of FDG was studied in Rowett nude (RNU) rats with a LS 174 T carcinoma xenograft in the left front leg and an Escherichia coli-induced focal infection in the right front leg. In 5 rats, dynamic FDG-PET was performed (27 frames of 6 - 15 minutes) up to 4 hours after injection of 11 MBq 18 FDG. The mean FDG uptake (SUV) was calculated and plotted by using a region of interest (ROI) centered over both lesions. In groups of 6 rats, the biodistribution of FDG was determined by counting dissected tissues at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after an injection of 11 MBq FDG. Means +/- the standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated. RESULTS: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) visualized both the tumor and the infection. The ROI analysis showed that FDG uptake in the infections was faster and higher, as compared to the tumor lesions. FDG uptake in the tumor reached a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 0. 8 +/- 0. 3 at 60 minutes and in the infectious lesions a SUV of 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 at 45 minutes, both remaining constant until 4 hours postinjection (p. i.). In the biodistribution study with ex vivo tissue counting, FDG had accumulated up to 1. 1 +/- 0. 1 %ID/g and 0. 8 +/- 0. 1 %ID/g at 1 hour in the tumor and infection, respectively, and remained constant until 4 hours for both lesions without significantly different wash-out from the 2 lesions. The tumor/blood and abscess/ blood ratios increased with time to 57 +/- 17 and 48 +/- 14, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although in this model differences in absolute FDG uptake and initial kinetics between tumor and infection were observed, the <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> of FDG from the lesions was similar over time. The retention of FDG in the inflammatory lesion indicated that dual time-point imaging does not necessarily resolve diagnostic pitfalls for FDG-PET in oncology in order to discriminate between malignant tumorous and benign infectious lesions...|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} the widespread axonal degeneration in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is not yet fully understood. The patterns of demyelination are different between different subgroups of patients with MS, suggesting that the disease is heterogeneous. It is known {{that the development of}} a chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain requires additional factors and that the impairment associated with relapsing-remitting clinical form is primarily caused by inflammation and demyelination, whereas the accumulation of irreversible neurological deficit, typical of the progressive forms, is caused mainly by axonal destruction and neuronal loss. Other mechanisms may contribute in determining brain damage {{during the course of the}} disease. One hypothesis is that immune factors interacting with the vascular system may secondarily induce changes in cerebral perfusion that are detectable in both early stage of disease and advanced disease and that may cause neuronal damage. The higher frequency of ischemic stroke in patients with MS may be due to several factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and increase of thrombophilic factors such as homocysteine. Recently it has been suggested that alterations of cerebral venous outflow in MS patients could determine perivenular extravasations of erythrocytes, iron overload and activation of the immune response. Vascular dysfunction could be one of the factors involved in the complex pathogenesis of MS. However, available data to support the presence and importance of vascular dysfunction are still insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. A first part of research project was to study the Internal Jugular Veins dynamics in MS patients compared with healthy controls using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy as a functional imaging for predicting the response to pre-operative chemotherapy. We aimed to compare 99 mTc-MIBI uptake and washout kinetics with chemotherapy response. Methods: Twenty-five patients (12 males and 13 females, aged between 8 and 52 y) &nbsp; with osteosarcoma were studied. Before the chemotherapy planar 99 mTc-MIBI anterior and posterior images of the involved area were obtained after 10 -min [(T 1 /B 1) 10 min] and 3 -hr after tracer injection. After completion of chemotherapy, again 99 mTc-MIBI scan was performed at 10 -min after tracer injection. Decay corrected tumor to background (T/B) ratios were calculated. Using the 10 -min and 3 -hr images of the pre-chemotherapy scintigraphy, percent <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> (WR%) of 99 mTc-MIBI were calculated. Using the 10 -min images of the pre- and post-chemotherapy scans, the percentage reduction of tumour uptake after treatment (Rn%) was also calculated. Then after neoadjuvant therapy, tumour response was assessed by examining the ratio of viable cells and by detecting percent necrosis. Scintigraphic results were compared with therapy response. Results: All patients showed significant 99 mTc-MIBI uptake in early images. Only 9 patients showed good response to chemotherapy (necrosis&ge; 90 %) while 16 patients were considered as non-responder(necrosis&lt; 90 %). There was no statistical significant difference between non-responders and responders in (T 1 /B 1) 10 min. There was a significant negative correlation between WR% and percent of necrosis(P= 0. 001). On the other hand, there was a significant correlation between Rn% and percent of necrosis(P&lt; 0. 001). There was also statistical significant difference in WR% and Rn% between non-responders and responders(both P&lt; 0. 001). Areas under the curves of the ROC curves analysis between WR%, Rn% and good response to chemotherapy were 0. 889 (P= 0. 002) and&nbsp; 0. 931 (P&lt; 0. 001) respectively. No any distant metastasis was found using 99 mTc-MIBI scan. Conclusion: High washout of 99 mTc-MIBI in pre-chemotherapy scintigraphy is a useful method for predicting to multidrug resistance. Assessment of wash-out analysis of MIBI using early and delayed images is recommended to predict the response. Rn% using pre- and post-chemotherapy MIBI scintigraphy is also useful for assessment of response to chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Rain is the {{predominant}} route for the atmospheric deposition of environmentally relevant compounds. For {{a better understanding}} of wash-out effects of metals such as Pb, Cu, and Cd it is necessary to examine individual rain events. The main focus of the present work was the determination of trace heavy metals in individual rain drops and rain drop fractions for a detailed investigation of different precipitation events such as cloudburst, drizzle, hail and snow. Moreover, the <b>wash-out</b> <b>rate</b> during the first minutes of rain events and the comparison of a typical urban location (Essen) with a rural area (Juelich) were of special interest. The method development included a sampling procedure for individual and size-classified rain drops by using liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, an approach for the determination of trace heavy metals in microvolumes was introduced. The measurements have been performed by using voltammetric techniques based on microelectrodes and ETV-ICP-MS. The possibilities and limitations of these approaches are shown. The stripping voltammetry required the development of specially designed measuring cells and single microelectrodes or microelectrode arrays. By such procedures determinations of Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn were carried out in microliters of rain water (2 - 100 #mu#l) and abolute detection limits in the lower picogram range were achieved. Additionally, a thin-layer flow cell in combination with microelectrode arrays was developed and the influence of a piezo actuator on the accumulation efficiency of the analyte on the electrode surface was discussed. By the application of these analytical methods on precipitation samples, specific concentration maxima in defined drop size fractions were found for Pb, Cu and Cd at both sampling sites (Essen, Juelich). For lead an increase of the metal concentration in drop volumes of 4 and 8 #mu#l was detected. All rain events showed a strong decrese in metal concentrations after 3 to 10 minutes. In addition to meal determinations the pH in rain drop fractions was analysed with ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFET). Also the input of major rain water constituents at both sampling areas was characterized by using ion chromatography and ETV-ICP-MS. Generally large concentration variations of all measured compounds between weekly collected rain samples were observed, but the average concentrations over the year were similar at both sampling areas. Obviously, the influence from local emission sources was low. (orig.)
