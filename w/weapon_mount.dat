5|$|The M15 was {{equipped}} with the M42 armored <b>weapon</b> <b>mount,</b> with two water-cooled coaxial M2 Browning machine guns above a 37mm gun. A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount placed on the M3 chassis, which resulted in its replacement with the M54 mount. The new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler and lighter air-cooled M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the steel}} body EQ2050, the SAC SFQ2040 has an {{aluminum}} alloy body, making it much {{lighter than the}} former. It uses a Cummins 4BTAA-92 turbodiesel engine. SAC lost out to DFM, which resulted {{in an attempt to}} create a civilian version of the SFQ2040, but it never went into production. [...] Both vehicles have limited armor protection against small caliber weapons. The vehicles can be fitted with additional equipment such as air conditioning, GPS, night vision equipment, vehicle-mounted radio, electric winch, and multipurpose <b>weapon</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E

The Mk3 features better ballistic protection over the Mk2 – the latter can withstand impacts from up to 7.62×51mm NATO rounds, while the former is capable of handling 5.56×45mm NATO impacts. The Mk3 is also lighter, more stable, has lower operating costs and comes with an 8-speed transmission compared to the 4-speed transmission of the Mk2.

50|$|A coaxial <b>weapon</b> <b>mount</b> places two {{weapons on}} {{roughly the same}} axis - as the weapons are usually {{side-by-side}} or {{one on top of}} the other, they are technically par-axial rather than coaxial, however the distances involved mean that they are effectively coaxial as far as the operator is concerned.|$|E
