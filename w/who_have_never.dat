5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace exposures are believed to be the cause in 10–20% of cases. In the United States they are believed to be related to more than 30% of cases among those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked and probably represent a greater risk in countries without sufficient regulations.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked. These cases are often caused {{by a combination of}} genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The system only {{applies to}} players {{currently}} under {{contract with a}} Japanese team, although players who have nine {{or more years of}} playing service with NPB are exempt. It does not apply to free agents or to amateur players <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> played in NPB. Mac Suzuki, Micheal Nakamura, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. The system does not work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as Alex Cabrera, who moved to NPB.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{original}} release of God of War III {{was met with}} critical acclaim, God of War III Remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it odd that Sony decided to remaster God of War III for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of God of War II, which may confuse newcomers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> played the previous games. Praise {{was given to the}} smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because {{the original}} already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.|$|E

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{independence}} of Slovenia, Slovenia's best clubs joined the newly formed Slovenian League. Maribor {{were one of the}} league's founding members, and are one of only three clubs, along with Gorica and Celje, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been relegated from the Slovenian top division. In the first couple of seasons, Maribor's rivals Olimpija from Ljubljana, who have had a long tradition of playing in the Yugoslav first league and at the time still had their squad composed of players from that era, dominated the league. Although Olimpija dominated the league, Maribor still managed to win the first edition of the Slovenian Cup in 1992. The final match was played in Ljubljana at Bežigrad Stadium versus Olimpija. It ended in a goalless draw after regular time and was won by Maribor after a penalty shoot-out (4–3). This was the first major success for Maribor. During the next season the team had their European début, appearing in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They played their first European match on 19 August 1992, when they hosted Ħamrun Spartans of Malta and won with the score 4–0. Ante Šimundža scored the first historic goal of the match. Olimpija {{went on to win the}} first four domestic championships, until their streak was interrupted by Gorica who won it in the 1995–96 season. Maribor were runners-up in the 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1994–95 seasons, before finishing third in 1993–94 and then fourth in the 1995–96 season. During this period the club managed to win another Slovenian cup in 1993–94, defeating Mura from Murska Sobota in the final with 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

During the play's two-year run, The Subject Was Roses played five different Broadway theaters and Dustin Hoffman became a replacement stage manager and understudied the role of Timmy.|$|R
