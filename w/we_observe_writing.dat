40|$|The set of {{ordinary}} differential equations (ODE) {{of a physical}} system determines the precise numerical behavior that will be exhibited in the future. Abstracting an ODE into a qualitative differential equation (QDE) system removes all quantities from the equations and leaves only {{the structure of the}} equation system intact. However, a QDE is still very useful in anticipating the future when the qualitative behavior of the system is important rather than the exact numerical solution. Another name for a QDE is a qualitative model. Qualitative relationships make up a qualitative model and it is possible to analyze how a change in one of the variables in the system affects the other variables using these relationships. In other words, qualitative models help us understand the underlying mechanism which determines the behavior that <b>we</b> <b>observe.</b> <b>Writing</b> qualitative models from scratch is a difficult problem which needs to be done by an intelligent expert with domain specific knowledge. Automating the discov-ery of qualitative models from observations is a difficult problem of machine learning. Various algorithms have been proposed for the solution of this problem in the litera-ture. This thesis presents a new algorithm called LYQUID for the solution of the sam...|$|E

We develop field-modulation spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance to characterize magnetic anisotropy and magnetic damping in nanomagnets.

40|$|This {{essay will}} concern itself {{with what we}} – ethnologists or ethnographers by any other name – do. Not {{primarily}} “do” in terms of activities we undertake; <b>we</b> interview, <b>we</b> <b>observe,</b> <b>we</b> <b>write,</b> we send emails, we have coffee, we print stacks of paper, we structure administrative chores, we go to meetings, we apply for grants, etc. Rather, we want to address the “do” {{in terms of what}} we make, or bring into the world through ethnography. What is it that we through the combination of all of our practices bring into being? What is that bringing into being dependent on? And, how does it influence the world? The first step to addressing these questions is outlining ethnography itself and how we – the authors – choose to articulate it. Articulation, as articulated by Donna Haraway is a process of signifying and of putting things together, letting them be diverse and maybe even in friction with one another and themselves.  The concept connotes an on-going indeterminacy. The articulations made in research, we argue, should be allowed to be of a searching quality, as well as being relational and expressive. They should not excuse themselves, neither make greater claims than they can fulfill. They should never be conclusive...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to justify the use of the microcanonical ensemble for isolated macroscopic quantum systems. Since there are huge number of independent observables in a macroscopic system, we cannot see all of them. Actually what <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> can be <b>written</b> in a rather simple combination of local observables. Considering this limitation, we show that almost all states in a energy shell are practically indistinguishable from one another, and hence from the microcanonical ensemble. In particular, the expectation value of a macroscopic observable is very close to its microcanonical ensemble average for almost all states.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a broad consensus over the need to reform the personal scope of the application of labour law. Great ideas are {{only the beginning of}} any law reform process, however. As labour law scholars, we often act as if change is driven by ideas, even as <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> and <b>write</b> about other causes of institutional change. The puzzle of how institutional change occurs in practice has absorbed regulatory and institutional theorists for some time. This article draws on the work of Kathleen Thelen, in particular. It is concerned with two strategies of purposeful institutional change and with the question of how agents of social change bring about reform. These strategies are here termed &# 039;complementary layering&# 039; and &# 039;experimental displacement&# 039; and illustrated with case studies drawn from the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Australia and head-load work in Maharashtra, India, two of the most innovative examples of strategies to expand the scope of labour market regulation worldwide. A mixed methodology entailing interviews with workers and regulatory agents, legal analysis and broader political economy analysis is employed to explore {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these strategies for bringing about institutional change in practice...|$|R

["Set out, 7th July" [...] (OEuvres, xxvii. part 1st, 67 n.).] Such {{attendance}} on Review-journeys, a mark of his being well with Papa, is now becoming usual; they are agreeable excursions, and cannot but be instructive as well. On this occasion, things went beautifully with him. Out in those grassy Countries, in the bright Summer, once more he had an unusually fine time;--and two very special pleasures befell him. First was, a sight of the Emigrants, our Salzburgers and other, in their flourishing condition, over in Lithuania yonder.

40|$|Buchwald (1878) {{used the}} term 'mirror writing' to {{indicate}} writing in the reverse direction to what is normal in a particular language and {{in which the individual}} letters are also reversed. Cases of healthy individuals (i. e., Leonardo da Vinci and Lewis Carroll) as well as brain-damaged patients have been described in the literature. Here, we report the case of PM, a 70 -year-old right-handed woman who showed right hemiplegia and mirror writing following a stroke in the left lenticular nucleus and internal capsulae. PM underwent a complete neuropsychological evaluation, which included copying, dictation and spontaneous writing in both hemispaces with both hands. She was also tested for topographical disorientation, visuo-spatial disorders and body schema deficits. <b>We</b> <b>observed</b> isolated mirror <b>writing</b> only when PM wrote with the left hand, without differences between hemispaces. She also showed a left-right disorientation, a body topological map disorder and an egocentric misrepresentation. The presence of mirror writing not confined to one hemispace and the co-presence of executive function disorders, as well as anosognosia, suggests damage to our patient's sub-cortical frontal network. As no previous interpretation fits with PM's symptoms, we hypothesize that mirror writing resulted from damage to her egocentric frame of reference. This hypothesis allows us to interpret the patient's array of disorders, including mirror writing, body topological map disorder, left-right confusion and egocentric representation...|$|R
40|$|Community {{networks}} are self-organized and decentralized communication networks built {{and operated by}} citizens, for citizens. The consolidation of today's cloud technologies offers now, for community networks, the possibility to collectively develop community clouds, building upon user-provided networks and extending toward cloud services. Cloud storage, and in particular secure and reliable cloud storage, could become a key community cloud service to enable end-user applications. In this paper, we evaluate in a real deployment the performance of Tahoe least-authority file system (Tahoe-LAFS), a decentralized storage system with provider-independent security that guarantees privacy to the users. We evaluate how the Tahoe-LAFS storage system performs when it is deployed over distributed community cloud nodes in a real community network such as Guifi. net. Furthermore, we evaluate Tahoe-LAFS in the Microsoft Azure commercial cloud platform, to compare and understand the impact of homogeneous network and hardware resources {{on the performance of}} the Tahoe-LAFS. <b>We</b> <b>observed</b> that the <b>write</b> operation of Tahoe-LAFS resulted in similar performance when using either the community network cloud or the commercial cloud. However, the read operation achieved better performance in the Azure cloud, where the reading from multiple nodes of Tahoe-LAFS benefited from the homogeneity of the network and nodes. Our results suggest that Tahoe-LAFS can run on community network clouds with suitable performance for the needed end-user experience. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R
