However, an opportunistic strike by Larsson on 80 minutes won the match and the tie for Celtic, meaning that Celtic would go through to the UEFA Cup Final, preventing an all-Portugal, and all-Oporto, final.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{financial}} burdens {{resulting from the}} Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of Luxemburg put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained {{only a quarter of}} the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> pennies of higher value would again be minted in a few years, suspended the collection of the tithe in 1434.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) {{find out}} that Dave was {{planning}} on marrying Linda; however, as the two were an interracial couple, they gained an enemy in Eric Singleton (Alexander Cendese), who stole the engagement ring out of the couple’s car, but after they were dead. Megan later finds residue in Linda's eyes {{to suggest that the}} killer closed her eyes after she died, which leads them back to Linda's parents, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Dave intended to propose. When they call the two into the office, Al admits he killed Dave and Linda. He had only wanted to scare them so they would not marry; however, the gun discharged, killing Linda, and in panic, he killed Dave too. After apologizing to Laura, Al is taken away. Throughout the day, Megan tries to reconnect with her daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser); however, her attempts to create a better relationship with her backfire.|$|E
5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E

The local weather bureau predicted thunderstorms, but nothing more serious.

The Free State took a total of over 12,000 Republicans prisoner during the war, of whom roughly 80, less than 1% were executed. How those who were executed were chosen from the others captured in arms is unclear; however, many more men were sentenced to the death penalty than were actually shot. This was intended to act as a deterrent to anti-Treaty fighters in the field, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> their imprisoned comrades were likely to be executed if they kept up their armed campaign.|$|E

In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II, the French Count of Foix.

25|$|The {{summer in}} Paris {{proved to be}} a busy one: the {{repertoire}} for the coming season needed to be chosen; costumes, assembled; and his troupe, reconstituted. The latter proved a daunting task. Jouvet was finally given leave from his duties at the Front, but the authorities refused to release Dullin. Jouvet constructed a model set, given the dimensions of the stage area at the Garrick while in New York the young Antonin Raymond battled with the Shubert brothers and their architect over the renovations to the theatre. With the intervention of Kahn, who footed the bill, and Mrs. Philip Lydig, who was overlooking many of the decorative details of the hall itself, the old Garrick finally started to take shape. Jouvet, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the design of the stage was essential {{to the success of the}} repertory that Copeau projected, left France in early October to oversee the final preparations of the stage.|$|E

In 1976 Lauda's second successive title seemed inevitable until he crashed on the second lap at the Nürburgring, suffering severe burns as well as lung and blood damage. He was given the last rites but unbelievably was back in his Ferrari six weeks later. He lost the championship by a single point to James Hunt in heavy rain at the final round at Fuji in Japan when he pitted his car and refused to continue, declaring that the risk was too great and that from now on he would refuse to race under extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Cornwallis Code, while {{defining}} {{the rights of}} the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to {{the rights of the}} under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ryots (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of Opium and Indigo, the former by the state, and the latter by British planters (most especially in the district of Tirhut in Bihar). Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.|$|E

25|$|Walton {{played a}} key role in Kennedy's 1960 presidential {{campaign}}. He volunteered to work on the campaign in the spring of 1960, long before most people believed Kennedy had a chance at the nomination. During the 1960 Democratic presidential primaries, he helped run the Kennedy campaign operation in West Virginia and Wisconsin. In the general election campaign, he had overall control of the Kennedy operation in New York, the most populous state, where the state Democratic Party was in disarray. Robert F. Kennedy sent Walton to New York to stabilize the campaign there. New York City reporter William Haddad had begun writing articles critical of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. that threatened to divide the New York state Democratic Party. Walton neutralized the problem by hiring Haddad as an aide to Robert Kennedy. Walton's organizational skills allowed him to rise quickly within the Kennedy organization, and he was given election assignments in Maine and California. Walton was also one of the few people <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> John Kennedy was in poor health during the campaign. Kennedy suffered from back problems, a deteriorating left knee, Addison's disease, and a possible addiction to amphetamines (which led to withdrawal effects). Walton witnessed Kennedy being followed throughout the campaign by an aide with a kit full of medication designed to treat Kennedy's illnesses.|$|E
