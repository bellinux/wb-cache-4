5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E

5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on roll. The school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> void by the Constitution.|$|E
40|$|We {{live in an}} epoch {{in which}} a violent clash exists. Humans {{typically}} {{believe that they are}} radically different from their surroundings. Yet, human knowledge has advanced to the point that has enabled the realisation that humans have evolved from their surroundings through a very gradual process of evolution; a process which has been ongoing since the Big Bang. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the nature of this violent clash. There are three interrelated aspects to this exploration. Firstly, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> why contemporary humans typically <b>consider</b> themselves to <b>be</b> radically different from their surroundings; this entails a consideration of how the human perceptual apparatus works and of how conceptions of their surroundings are formed within humans. Secondly, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> the likelihood that humans are actually very similar to their surroundings; this entails an exploration of various phenomena such as mind, consciousness, naturalness, awareness, the senses, perception and 'what-it-is-likeness'. Thirdly, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> whether the human species has a special place in the evolutionary process. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E
5|$|Each of Sweden's 21 {{counties}} (län), 25 provinces (landskap) and 290 municipalities (kommun) {{has its own}} coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) {{introduced the}} modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties {{have been the subject}} of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly similar regions. (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, Skåne, Södermanland, Uppsala, Värmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created Gävleborgs län, occupying parts of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, bears their arms quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display their arms with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses the arms of a few of these regions, selected for their heraldic notability.
