500|$|The {{scenes that}} {{featured}} Rachel's party were acclaimed by most reviewers. Fallon called them [...] "a parade {{of the funniest}} sight gags, most uninhibited acting, and—interestingly enough—most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while", and described Michele as [...] "an acting stand out" [...] who [...] "handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne". His colleague Meghan Brown said it [...] "showed Glee at its best", and added: [...] "The dialogue was snappy, the group dynamic <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> specific, and the kids seemed like actual kids." [...] VanDerWerff {{also pointed out that}} the club members [...] "really felt like kids, not like miniature 30-somethings", and said the party was the [...] "best part" [...] of the episode. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn's breakdown of [...] "the five drunk girl archetypes, as demonstrated by the glee girls". Harper wrote that the party scenes [...] "left a lot to be desired", and Patrick Burns, the third reviewer from The Atlantic, [...] "waited for the Glee party to get out of control, or for someone to get hurt so that America's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking", but [...] "the worst thing that happened was that Rachel tried to flip a gay guy".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), at the {{beginning}} of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt, God told Moses to have the Israelites celebrate Passover at its set time. But some men were unclean because they had had contact with a corpse and could not offer the Passover sacrifice on the set day. They asked Moses and Aaron how they could participate in Passover, and Moses told them to stand by while he listened for God's instructions. God told Moses that whenever Israelites were defiled by a corpse or on a long journey on Passover, they were to offer the Passover offering on the 14th day of the second month—a month after Passover—otherwise in strict accord with the law of the Passover sacrifice. But if a man who <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> not on a journey refrained from offering the Passover sacrifice, he was to be cut off from his kin.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{termination}} of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest. Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine {{as an alternative to the}} liquid cooled engines which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest Mk II prototypes were completed. Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding [...] "gills". The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> effective.|$|E

Westbrook was checked into rehab and, six months later, she appeared on the Channel 4 show The Priory with the claim that she <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> had been free from drugs for months. However, hosts Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball struggled to get coherent answers from Westbrook, who was under the influence of drugs despite her claims of abstinence. Reflecting back on the event in 2002, Westbrook commented [...] "I said I was clean, but it was obvious I wasn't. I looked about 50, and my voice was shaky. I should never have been allowed on. They wanted to laugh at me, rip me apart. I despise that sort of thing, but it did me the world of good because watching it I realised, 'I'm so ill.' When it came to the crunch I thought, 'Hang on.

2500|$|Each {{official}} game requires having several referees {{present as}} well as an official snitch. The referees are the head ref whose job is to control the field and administer fouls and yellow or red cards to offending players, assistant refs who assist the head referee in watching for illegal plays, the snitch ref who follows the snitch once they enter the field and determine whether or not the catch <b>was</b> <b>clean,</b> <b>and</b> the goal refs whose job is to determine whether the quaffle went through the hoop. Assistant refs are oftentimes called bludger or beater refs, and their job is to call [...] "beat" [...] (or, in French, [...] "touché") when the beat was clean (meaning hit the opposing player), to help determine whether a goal was scored based on the beat and assist with making calls concerning illegal action or give verbal warnings to players. Assistant referees are also able to communicate to the head ref for a stoppage of play if witness to an action that would result in a yellow card. Snitch refs, whilst the snitch is off field, act as an additional bludger ref.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} high school in 1959, he {{rejected}} a contract from a minor league professional baseball team so that he could attend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. Following his second semester at the predominantly white University of Illinois, Jackson transferred to the North Carolina A, an historically black university located in Greensboro, North Carolina. There are differing accounts of the reasons behind this transfer. Jackson has claimed that he changed schools because racial prejudice prevented him from playing quarterback and limited his participation on a competitive public-speaking team. Writing on ESPN.com in 2002, sociologist Harry Edwards noted that the University of Illinois had previously had a black quarterback, but also noted that black athletes attending traditionally white colleges during the 1950s and 1960s encountered a [...] "combination of culture shock and discrimination". Edwards also suggested that Jackson had left the University of Illinois in 1960 because he had been placed on academic probation. However, the president of the University of Illinois reported in 1987 that Jackson's 1960 freshman year transcript <b>was</b> <b>clean,</b> <b>and</b> said he would have been eligible to re-enroll at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{program does}} have its {{supporters}} and success stories. If a participant follows all the rules, they can complete the program and have their convictions purged in 30 months. The situation of Charlie McCullough {{should have been a}} complete success story, but it took a detour. McCullough was caught in a police sting buying drugs, and entered drug court voluntarily, determined to kick drugs. Everything went fine for 22 months; he never missed a meeting or appointment and passed all his drug tests. Then at a random urine screening, the lab technician told him he tested positive for methamphetamine. McCullough insisted that he <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> asked to take another test, which he passed. A third test was administered, which he also passed, so McCullough was relieved. At his next court appearance, Judge Williams asked why he failed a drug test. He was surprised, and stated that he passed the second test. The judge told him she was going to use the first test; the second one didn't count. No matter how much he professed his innocence, the judge didn't believe him. The judge refused to bring in the lab technician to testify, but asked McCullough if he would take a polygraph, which he agreed, then she changed her mind and sentenced him to three days in jail for a [...] "bad" [...] test and 14 days for questioning the results of the drug screening. From that point on, his drug court experience went downhill.|$|E
