5|$|Montagu {{continued}} the deception {{to reinforce the}} existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in The Times on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on the street children of Bogotá, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E

25|$|The process {{leading up}} to the passing of the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill began with the {{publication}} in 1989 of a white paper entitled Maintenance of Religious Harmony.

25|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Ceylon by the British and the first recorded match is dated 1832. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> in the Colombo Journal on 5 September 1832 which called {{for the formation of}} a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed and matches began soon afterwards when it played, on the Rifle Green in Colombo, against a team from the 97th Regiment of Foot which was stationed on the island from 1825 to 1836. Through the 19th century, cricket was essentially the preserve of European settlers and visitors but it gradually attracted the native Ceylonese who were, at first, often needed to make up the numbers.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{plausible}} {{reason why}} Manoj Prabhakar {{had to wait}} 3 to 6 years to report match-fixing allegations. Manjrekar's statement contradicted Prabhakar's on the events at Sharjah in October 1991. No evidence was provided {{with respect to the}} Singer Cup incident nor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> made to the Captain, Coach or Vice-captain. Manoj's allegation against Aamir Sohail and Mohammad Azharuddin on the toss incident was factually incorrect as there was no match when these 2 cricketers captained their countries in Sharjah. Manoj Prabhakar refused to name the attempted briber in spite of assurances from the judge himself. The judge concluded that Manoj's allegation was a result of his getting back at Mohammad Azharuddin. The judge had no hesitation in rejecting the allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar.|$|E
