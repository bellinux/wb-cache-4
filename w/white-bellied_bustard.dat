50|$|The <b>white-bellied</b> <b>bustard</b> or white-bellied korhaan (Eupodotis senegalensis) is an African {{species of}} bustard. It is {{widespread}} in sub-Saharan Africa in grassland and open woodland habitats.|$|E
2500|$|This {{offers an}} {{intimate}} {{view of the}} zoo's four African elephants in their 275,000-gallon pool. The zoo {{is one of the}} few to house male elephants. The male African elephant, Ali, was donated by Michael Jackson in 1997. The other two, Thandi and Sheena, are females. The area features a reptile house with Egyptian cobras, green mambas, and a [...] African rock python named Solomon. <b>White-bellied</b> <b>bustards,</b> fruit bats, klipspringers, and lappet-faced vultures are found in smaller side exhibits.|$|R
40|$|Background H 9 N 2 avian {{influenza}} viruses continue to spread in poultry and wild birds throughout Eurasia. Objectives To characterize H 9 N 2 influenza viruses from pheasants, quail, and <b>white-bellied</b> <b>bustards</b> (WBBs) used to train falcons in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods Four H 9 N 2 viruses were isolated from pheasants, quail, and WBB used for falconry in the UAE, and antigenic, molecular, phylogenetic analysis, and invivo characterization of H 9 N 2 viruses were performed. Results and conclusions The pheasant and WBB isolates were antigenically and molecularly clearly related {{and along with}} the quail isolates contained multiple “avian–human ” substitutions. The release of smuggled H 9 N 2 -infected birds for falconry {{may contribute to the}} spread of these viruses to wild birds, domestic poultry, and humans...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the gross {{anatomy of the}} alimentary tract of Houbara Bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii), Kori Bustards (Ardeotis kori), Rufous-crested Bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista) and <b>White-bellied</b> <b>Bustards</b> (Eupodotis senegalensis) maintained in captivity by the National Avian Research Center in the United Arab Emirates. The morphology of the alimentary tract and the proportions of each region were similar in all 4 species. The length of the oesophagus, combined proventriculus and ventriculus, small intestine, and large intestine formed 24. 2 - 28. 4 %, 7. 3 - 9. 7 %, 40. 5 - 55. 1 % and 9. 1 - 14. 7 % of the total alimentary tract length respectively. Neither crop nor oesophageal enlargement was observed in the birds {{examined in this study}}, although male Kori Bustards possessed a saccus oralis in the oropharyngeal cavity. Oesophagi, proventriculi, ventriculi, caeca and large intestine were well developed in all species. The small intestine was shorter than that of other avian herbivores and granivores when compared on a bodyweight basis. The well differentiated stomachs and well developed caeca of the bustards examined in this study are characteristic of omnivores. Analysis of the mean lengths of the alimentary tract components and weight of the liver and pancreas showed sexual dimorphism in cases where male and female data were available for direct comparison...|$|R
