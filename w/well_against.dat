5|$|Bailey left Charlton {{to replace}} Alan Mullery as Brighton & Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board {{ironically}} decided to name Mullery as Bailey's successor. Charlton finished the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total. He performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> divisional champions Luton Town, giving captain Mal Donaghy a difficult afternoon, which {{was enough to}} win him a move to his next club.|$|E
5|$|Though major {{locations}} held up <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the earthquake, most villages did not. From Qeshm Island came {{reports of}} power outage and minor damage; 100 houses {{in all of}} Qeshm were damaged between 30 and 50 percent. Two-hundred villages were devastated by the earthquake's velocity. Walls {{in the village of}} Zeynabi were leveled; all were reduced by the earthquake to debris. Relief workers were sent to rescue any residents from their homes if they had been caught under debris.|$|E
5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to match up <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare <b>well</b> <b>against</b> more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E
5|$|Costa scored {{his first}} goal for Spain {{with the third}} in a 4–0 UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} win away to Luxembourg on 12 October 2014. He did not feature again for Spain until 5 September 2015, when he was fouled by Slovakia goalkeeper Matúš Kozáčik for a penalty, which Andrés Iniesta converted for a 2–0 qualifying win at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere in Oviedo. He was booed when he was substituted for Paco Alcácer later in the match. Del Bosque defended Costa from criticism, saying that he performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the Slovak defence. However, he {{was not included in}} the final squad for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1794, war {{continued}} in the Rhineland, with General Louis Desaix pushing back the Coalition forces. Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th Dragoon Regiment, with General Delmas de La Coste as commander. The brigade performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions {{at the end of}} May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in several well-led cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander who knew how to drill his men effectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did <b>well</b> <b>against</b> Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the club}} again made MLS history by {{becoming}} the first United States-based team to participate in Copa Sudamericana, entering in the Round of sixteen. Since 2006, United has played <b>well</b> <b>against</b> international competition, beating Scottish champions Celtic F.C. and drawing Real Madrid in Seattle. In addition, the 2006 MLS All-Star Team, which included eight United players and was managed by United's manager Piotr Nowak, defeated English champions Chelsea. In 2006 and 2007, United became the first club in league history to win the MLS Supporters' Shield consecutively.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Falcons overcame a 20–7 halftime {{deficit to}} defeat the Buccaneers in {{overtime}} on a Mick Luckhurst field goal. The strategy of running out the clock with a conservative offense that had worked so <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the Lions the previous week backfired against the Falcons. The Buccaneers' offensive line failed to dominate, and the Falcons wound up running 57 offensive plays in the second half, while the Buccaneers ran only 26. Twenty of those plays were runs by Gerald Riggs, who finished the day with 127 yards rushing. The Buccaneers outgained the Falcons 255 yards to 190 in the first half, but were outgained 300 yards to 68 in the second half, in which the Buccaneers never advanced beyond midfield. The win left Atlanta undefeated at 4–0.|$|E

5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick played <b>well</b> <b>against</b> a weak Zimbabwe {{side in the}} two-Test {{series in}} May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan {{averaging}} over 100. His form continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening stand with Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained his form in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at The Oval completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.|$|E
5|$|Allen captained England in the {{remaining}} two Tests against India. The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80, his best figures in Test matches. In the Tests, Allen scored 27 runs in three innings, and took 20 wickets at 16.50. His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> some of the strongest opposition; he topped the county's batting averages and came second in bowling. The MCC team for Australia was chosen in several stages with input from Allen. Larwood was not considered; he had spoken out in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline, and like Voce, had not played a Test since the 1932–33 series. The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen at first threatened to resign were he to be included. He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline. He was therefore named in the touring team.|$|E

50|$|Not much {{is known}} of Converse's early {{military}} service. In 1690, however, he was a captain on the Maine frontier commanding one of the provincial companies raised by drafts from the several militia regiments. The next year he had to bury the victims of fight at Wheelwright Pond, and later the same year he was second in command of Benjamin Church's second expedition to Maine. In 1691 Converse participated {{in the defense of}} <b>Wells,</b> Maine <b>against</b> hostile Indians, and the next year he led the defense of <b>Wells</b> <b>against</b> a larger enemy force. In 1693 Converse led provincial forces in a search and destroy operation against hostile Indians in Maine. At the outbreak of the new war in 1702, the governor made him commander of all Massachusetts provincial forces in the field.|$|R

5|$|Following that loss, Virginia Tech {{head coach}} Frank Beamer {{announced}} that backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor, {{who had previously}} been expected to sit out the season on redshirt status, would play in the Hokies' second game, against Furman. Both Taylor and starting quarterback Sean Glennon performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the Paladins, and Tech won, 24–7. Tech's third game came against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, who were employing a new offensive system, the option offense, under first-year head coach Paul Johnson. Unlike the game against Furman, Taylor started the game and remained at quarterback throughout, guiding the Hokies to their first ACC victory of the season, a 20–17 win that later gave Tech a crucial head-to-head tiebreaker against the Yellow Jackets, fellow members of the Coastal Division. The Hokies' fourth {{game of the season}} came against the North Carolina Tar Heels, who were defeated by the same margin of victory as Tech's win against Georgia Tech, 20–17.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} a holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E

5|$|Speedie {{was drafted}} by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft. Fred Mandel, {{the owner of the}} Lions, visited him at Fort Warren and offered a {{contract}} worth $2,800 a year. Speedie wanted to sign immediately, but Mandel preferred to wait until after the war. By the time the war drew to a close in 1945, however, Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was pursued by the Rockets after playing <b>well</b> <b>against</b> a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets' players were drawn. Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown, who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos. Brown, who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns, sent a friend named Jackie Ranen to sign Speedie for $7,000 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The West Indian's {{had begun}} to {{experience}} difficulties in {{the final years of}} the 1960s. The Indian defeat had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they played <b>well</b> <b>against</b> Australia on the 1972–73 tour, they lost 2:1. In the Fourth Test in Guyana they fell to a 10-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings. The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues. In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests. The West Indians played Andy Roberts and Michael Holding in both games, though India played well enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures. Their victory in the second involved a record 406-run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera <b>well</b> <b>against</b> the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E
