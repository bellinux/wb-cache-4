40|$|Abstract — The {{capability}} of autonomous platforms to function on beaches {{is critical for}} a wide range of military and civilian operations. Of particular importance is the ability to autonomously navigate through rocky terrain, hard-packed moist sand, and loose dry sand typically found in these environments. The study of animal locomotion mechanisms provides specific movement principles that can be applied to address these demands. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, control system development, and field-testing of a biologically inspired autonomous robot for deployment and operation in a surf-zone environment. The robot successfully fuses a range of insect-inspired passive mechanisms with active autonomous control architectures to seamlessly adapt to and traverse through a range of challenging substrates. Field testing establishes the performance of the robot to navigate semi-rugged terrain in the surf-zone environment including: soft to hard packed sand, mild to medium inclines, and rocky terrain. Platform autonomy is shown to be effective for navigation and communication.

The electrical dressing method {{is used for}} overcoming {{the limitations of the}} conventional dressing methods available in relation to a super-abrasive wheel because of the hardness of its abrasive grains and the durability of its bonding material. The proposed hybrid in-process electrical dressing method consists of electro-discharge and electro-chemical processes and is implemented with twin copper electrodes and alternating power supplies. The results show that with properly maintained process conditions, a better surface finish is produced by the proposed method compared with traditional rotating SiC <b>wheel</b> dressing. <b>Index</b> Terms — Electro-chemical, electro-discharge, inprocess dressing, metal-bonded diamond grinding wheel. eliminates the need for a carbon brush as a means to deliver the current to the wheel during a dressing process. A combination of electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressing has been developed by Schopf et al. [2] and Ohmori et al. [3]. It suggested that the electro-chemical dressing is assisted by the thermal erosive effect of electrical discharge. The application is implemented for centreless grinding with single electrode supplied with a DC power supply via a pair of brushes. A further improvement is proposed here. The use of twin electrodes [4] and in-process dressing using AC power supplies are implemented. This approach allows electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressings to be performed individually as required, rather than conducted alternating on single electrode.

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic routing {{protocols}} such as RIP and OSPF essentially implement distributed algorithms for solving the shortest paths problem. The border gateway protocol (BGP) {{is currently the}} only interdomain routing protocol deployed in the Internet. BGP does not solve a shortest paths problem since any interdomain protocol is required to allow policy-based metrics to override distance-based metrics and enable autonomous systems to independently define their routing policies {{with little or no}} global coordination. It is then natural to ask if BGP {{can be viewed as a}} distributed algorithm for solving some fundamental problem. We introduce the stable paths problem and show that BGP can be viewed as a distributed algorithm for solving this problem. Unlike a shortest path tree, such a solution does not represent a global optimum, but rather an equilibrium point in which each node is assigned its local optimum. We study the stable paths problem using a derived structure called a dispute wheel, representing conflicting routing policies at various nodes. We show that if no dispute wheel can be constructed, then there exists a unique solution for the stable paths problem. We define the simple path vector protocol (SPVP), a distributed algorithm for solving the stable paths problem. SPVP is intended to capture the dynamic behavior of BGP at an abstract level. If SPVP converges, then the resulting state corresponds to a stable paths solution. If there is no solution, then SPVP always diverges. In fact, SPVP can even diverge when a solution exists. We show that SPVP will converge to the unique solution of an instance of the stable paths problem if no dispute <b>wheel</b> exists. <b>Index</b> Terms—BGP, Border Gateway Protocol, interdomain routing, internet routing, path vector protocols, stable routing...|$|R
40|$|Grinding is a {{critical}} manufacturing process and is often the only alternative when producing precision components or when machining brittle materials such as ceramics. Characterizing and modeling the surface finish in the grinding process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of the size, shape and spatial distribution of abrasive grains {{that make up the}} surface of grinding wheels. Since the surface finish obtained in grinding is a direct function of the wheel surface topography, which is conditioned by a single point dressing process, understanding the effects of dressing parameters on the wheel topography is essential. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are: 1) to experimentally characterize the three-dimensional surface topography of a conventional grinding wheel including attributes such as the abrasive grain height distribution, grain geometry and spacing parameters and their respective statistical distributions, 2) {{to determine the effects of}} single point dressing conditions on the three-dimensional wheel surface topography parameters and their distributions, 3) to model and simulate the three-dimensional wheel surface topography, and 4) to experimentally validate the wheel topography model. In this research, new and existing characterization methods are used to characterize the wheel surface and the individual abrasive grains. The new techniques include the use of X-ray micro-tomography (μCT) to obtain a better understanding of the grinding wheel's internal micro-structure, and a focus variation based optical measurement method and scanning electron microscopy to characterize previously ignored attributes such as the number of sides and aspect ratio of individual grains. A seeded gel (SG) vitrified bond conventional grinding wheel is used in the study. A full factorial design of single point wheel dressing experiments is performed to investigate the effects infeed and lead dressing parameters on the grinding wheel surface topography. A custom <b>wheel</b> <b>indexing</b> apparatus is built to facilitate precision relocation of the grinding wheel surface to enable optical comparison of the pre- and post-dressing wheel surface topography to observe wheel surface generation mechanisms such as macro-fracture and grain dislodgement. Quantitative descriptions of how each dressing parameter affects the wheel surface characteristics are given in terms of the wheel surface roughness amplitude parameters (Sp, Ssk, Sku) and areal and volume parameters (Spk, Sk, Vmp, Vmp, Vvc, Smr 1) derived from the bearing area curve. A three-dimensional wheel topography simulation model that takes as input the abrasive grain height distribution and the statistical distributions for the various abrasive grain geometry parameters is developed and experimentally validated. The results of wheel characterization studies show that the actual abrasive grain height distribution in the SG wheel follows a beta distribution. The μCT work shows that the abrasives are polyhedral in shape, as opposed to the spherical or conical shapes commonly assumed in grinding literature. Grain spacing is found to follow a beta distribution while the number of sides of the grain and the grain aspect ratio are found to follow the gamma and the Weibull distribution, respectively. The results of the dressing study show that the lead dressing parameter has the strongest effect on wheel topography. Using statistical distributions for the key parameters (e. g. grain height, number of sides, grain spacing), a stochastic three-dimensional model is developed to simulate the wheel surface topography under different dressing conditions. The resulting model is shown to yield realistic results compared to existing models mainly due the fact that additional abrasive grain geometry parameters and more realistic assumptions of the different grain attributes are used in the model. It is shown that the model follows the overall wheel surface topography trends during dressing but has difficulty in accurately simulating some of the wheel characteristics under specific dressing conditions. The thesis then concludes with a summary of the main findings and possible future research avenues including extending the model to rotary dressing and simulation of wheel-workpiece interaction. M.

This filter device functions {{in conjunction with the}} Department of Architecture's Daylighting Laboratory goniophotometer to profile the complete reflection and transmission properties for sample building materials. The resulting data is used in computer simulations and material optimization. The goniophotometer uses two types of detection cameras, color and infrared, to measure the light that is transmitted or reflected off a sample of material. The spectral sensitivity variances of the cameras create inaccuracies in the resulting data when full-spectrum light is used. To remove these inaccuracies, the light is filtered into smaller sections of the full spectrum and the data is recombined by software, to remove these inaccuracies.
