25|$|Later in 1968, after Deep Diver {{had been}} requisitioned by the United States Navy to help {{search for the}} lost {{submarine}} USS Scorpion, the Bureau of Ships determined that Deep Diver was unsafe for use at great depths or in extremely cold temperatures because of the substitution of the <b>wrong</b> <b>kind</b> of steel, which became brittle in cold water, {{in some parts of}} the sub. Link proceeded to design a new lockout sub with a distinctive acrylic bubble as the forward pilot/observer compartment. In January 1971 the new sub was launched and commissioned to the Smithsonian Institution. It was named the Johnson Sea Link after its donors, Link and his friend John Seward Johnson I. Deep Diver was decommissioned and donated to the Smithsonian Institution. It was placed on display at the Marine Sciences Center in Fort Pierce, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his life. Sometime around 1977, he started using amphetamines and other prescription narcotics in an attempt to counteract the debilitating hangovers and eventually to rid himself of alcohol addiction. While these attempts were partially successful, he ended up trading alcoholism for a severe drug dependency that was fast spiralling out of control. He was reduced to begging some of his close friends in the medical profession for supplies of drugs, often using his acting skills to collapse in a medical office and imitate a seizure or some other condition requiring a painkiller injection. On 25 July 1979 (a year to the day before his death) he suffered a cardiac arrest and was clinically dead for several minutes during a concert tour of Soviet Uzbekistan, after injecting himself with a <b>wrong</b> <b>kind</b> of painkiller he had previously obtained from a dentist's office.|$|E

50|$|John Smith {{had left}} the Jamestown {{adventure}} but he still believed in the colonial enterprise and craved the excitement of sea-borne adventure. In 1614 he associated himself {{with a group of}} adventurers under Captain Marmeduke Roydon who appointed him head of an expedition of two vessels to Northern Virginia. The commercial purpose was to take whales for fins and oil and to seek out mines of gold or copper. In the event those purposes failed, they were to obtain sufficient fish to defray the cost of the voyage. Whaling soon proved impractical; they had no way to kill the whales, and the whales were the <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> anyway. No one had any expertise in finding gold mines, so in the end the voyage came down to obtaining fish and furs to defray the expense. Most of the crew spent their time fishing, while Smith and eight others took a small boat on a coasting expedition during which for trifles he was able to obtain 11,000 beaver skins and 100 each of martins and otters.|$|R

30|$|At {{the global}} scale, too much {{fire and the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> of fire now trump not enough fire as the most {{influential}} fire problems that ecologists must face. Fire ecologists must frame arguments for government prohibition of burning and more effective fire suppression {{in terms of the}} global reality. Excluding fire in large areas over extended time scales doesn’t work and never will. We need to be courageous about sharing examples from around the world where central governments have bumped up against the limits of their influence in containing fire. In Madagascar, for example, restrictions on burning were legislated nationally to protect timber and other resources in 1907 and 1913, little more than a decade after French colonization of the country (Kull 2002). In the face of a century of heavy sanctions against using fire, local people who depend upon fire for survival have developed a complex system of social resistance in which fire management is clandestine: fires are lit at night and burn unattended. Local communities protect fire practitioners’ identities, resisting government inquiry into who started a particular fire, and burning is done during periods when locals know that the government is unlikely to enforce sanctions (Kull 2002).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I offer {{a reading}} of Juvenal’s “Satire VI” {{as an example of}} ancient Roman satirists’ use of inversion, one of many {{techniques}} meant to invite political criticism without attracting the <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> of autocratic attention. I claim that Juvenal inverts the paradigmatic father-son[-wife] relationship with a wife-husband-child chain to suggestively critique Roman governmental authority. This examination includes the relationship between the autocracy and aristocracy in ancient Rome, the nuances of the Roman household in relation to patriarchal representation, Roman satire’s social function, aristocratic expectations of satire, and alternative forms of luxurious entertainment. Knowing that their writing would not create immediate change, satirists such as Juvenal convert an aristocratic audience’s stress into humor, and in doing so channel a kind of “soft power” that aims to gently influence rather than directly attack. I conclude by restating that shying away from the search for meaning due to offensive metaphor (in this case, misogyny) is an academic mistake because it focuses on textual façade over underlying meaning. In fact, it is as these times of feeling offended that we should be more aggressive in our pursuit of meaning...|$|R
40|$|Pascal Engel (2008) {{has insisted}} {{that a number of}} notable {{strategies}} for rejecting the knowledge norm of assertion are put forward {{on the basis of the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> of reasons. A central aim of this paper will be to establish the contrast point: I argue that one very familiar strategy for defending the knowledge norm of assertion—viz., that it is claimed to do better in various respects than its competitors (e. g. the justification and the truth norms) — relies on a presupposition that is shown to be ultimately under motivated. That presupposition is the uniqueness thesis—that there is a unique epistemic rule for assertion, and that such a rule will govern assertions uniformly. In particular, the strategy I shall take here will be to challenge the sufficiency leg of the knowledge norm in a way that at the same time counts against Williamson’s (2000) own rationale for the uniqueness thesis. However, rather than to challenge the sufficiency leg of the knowledge norm via the familiar style of ‘expert opinion’ and, more generally, ‘second-hand knowledge’ cases (e. g. Lackey (2008)), a strategy that has recently been called into question by Benton (2014), I’ll instead advance a very different line of argument against the sufficiency thesis, one which turns on a phenomenon I call epistemic hypocrisy...|$|R
