5000|$|The video {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Crystal Bell, a blogger for Huffington Post, called the video an [...] "ode to Instagram," [...] and {{compared it to}} Del Rey's previous videos. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media wrote, that [...] "it's certainly no seven-minute re-enactment {{of the life of}} the Kennedy family, but it still offers the trademark LDR touch. Instagram-like footage, very forlorn faces, possible suicide attempts, and a very special guest." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein, of MTV's Buzzworthy blog, considers that the coral-smoked scenes are Del Rey in the afterlife, post-suicide, saying it may be unlikely as, [...] "the clip closes with an image of Lana and her ghost walking alone down an empty road." [...] Further, she said, [...] "Sad, sad times, y'all. But then again <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> expect from a Lana video? Sunshine, glitter and ice cream cones? Probably not." [...] Brennan Carley of Billboard noted that [...] "keeping the buzz alive while sticking with sepia-tones and a healthy dose of melodramatics, Lana Del Rey probes a crumbling relationship in the music video ... the video traces the women's relationship with spliced together film bits - much like the effects used in her earlier efforts - and foggy scenes of the stars pouting and glancing seductively over their shoulders." [...] Spin magazine writer Marc Hogan found that the video recalled Del Rey's breakout video for [...] "Video Games". He added, that [...] "more provocative, though, is the hint of romance-gone-sour between Del Rey and the character played by actress Jaime King. Because this is a Lana Del Rey video, it's not spoiling anything to say there's a Thelma and Louise-like twist." [...] Entertainment website Spinner called the visual [...] "weird. It's beautifully shot, sepia-soaked and melodramatic. The singer's bestie, played by the very lovely actress Jamie King, is also pretty sad about summer ending." [...] Tyler Monroe, writing for AUX, called the video [...] "indistinguishable nothingness", adding [...] "I don't think Lana Del Rey is even trying anymore." ...|$|E
