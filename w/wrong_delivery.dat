However, Frank and Jane are unable to find the bomb before the nomination for Best Picture has begun. When Frank bursts onto the stage and awkwardly tries to prevent the detonation of the bomb, Rocco and his mother realize {{what is going on}} and kidnap Jane, but in the process, Frank loosens an electronic sign which takes out Muriel. Desperate, Rocco decides to detonate the bomb to follow his mother, but Frank manages to catapult Rocco and the bomb out of {{the awarding}} hall right into Papshmir's private helicopter (which was circling overhead), with the bomb eliminating all hostile parties involved. Frank and Jane reaffirm their love under the applause of the awarding audience and viewers worldwide. Nine months later, Frank and Nordberg rush into the pediatric ward to witness the birth of Frank's child but in their hurry run into the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery.</b> Seeing that the baby is African-American, Frank assumes Nordberg is responsible and angrily chases him. Just after they leave, Ed comes out of another hospital room with Jane, who is holding their real baby.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Del and Rodney {{are called}} to see a {{solicitor}} named Mr. Cartwright, thinking that he will charge them with fraud since they failed to pay the Inland Revenue. But fortunately, Mr. Cartwright brings good news to the Trotter Brothers. After reading a copy of Albert's will, the Trotters discover that Albert invested {{his share of the}} Trotter fortune in a far more stable area prior to his death, while his nephews invested their shares in the Central American market. According to his will, Albert wanted to give his enlarged share of the fortune to his nephews, leaving them with £145,000 each. Del and Rodney are both stunned by all this, until Del gets a phone call from Raquel that Cassandra's gone into labour. Del and Rodney race to the hospital and almost end up in the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery</b> room, but eventually make their way to delivery room #16, where Raquel and Damien wait outside with good and bad news. The bad news is that Cassandra had to be given a Caesarean section. The good news is that Rodney and Cassandra are now the parents of a baby girl. As Rodney looks at his newborn daughter, Raquel asks Del what the good news he had was, only for Del to say that he will tell her later but mentions Albert as the reason.|$|E

In-ternet of Things is a good enabling technology for logistics and supply chains which implements seamless, real-time tracking and monitoring goods {{at the level of}} items. In this paper, we propose a solution, which adopts RFID/GPS/ 3 G/GIS technologies to implement real-time surveillance of logistics in transit. Based on the proposed solution, we chose the tabacco logistics as an example and developed an actual monitoring system for Logistics & Distribution Center of China, which successfully implements real-time vehicle tracking and cigarette packages monitoring. The outcome indicates that this solution minimizes missing goods and effectively reduces <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Precast {{construction}} projects {{are associated with}} many activities, numerous parties, enormous effort, and different processes. For effective communication, this requires delivering appropriate and up-to-date information to enhance collaboration and improve integration. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop the system architecture and prototype of Context-Aware Cloud Computing Building Information Modelling (CACCBIM) for precast supply chain management. The findings of this research are grounded on the literature of cloud computing, context-awareness, building information modelling, and, ultimately, the analysis of interviews with stakeholders in precast construction. Findings determine that lack of integration, improper planning and scheduling, poor production timing, poor coordination, lack of good communication among parties, <b>wrong</b> <b>deliveries,</b> and poor control and supervision are the major issues within the precast supply chain. These issues could result in adverse consequences for the objectives and success of the precast project. Eventually, to reduce and eliminate these issues, the proposed prototype will support appropriate deliveries, efficient monitoring, facilitation of coordination, and collaboration with improved communication. It is anticipated that this research will establish a unique perception in the precast construction industry, which will finally enhance its productivity, improve its efficiency, and maximise its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{integrations}} {{and lack}} of collaboration are the major obstacles within the precast construction projects. Inorder to improve collaboration among precast supply chain stakeholders on the various phases of precast construction(planning, design, manufacturing, transportation, installation and construction), a system are needed for an effectivecommunication and accessing to up to date information. This paper is aimed to explore {{the potential of the}} cloud computingtechnology as the construction collaboration tools for precast supply chain management. The research findings areestablished according to the study of comprehensive literature on information technology, supply chain management and precast construction industry. Findings shows that the poor planning and scheduling, high cost of precast concretecomponents, the poor design, lack of architectural creativities, the poor production timing, large size and heavy precastcomponents, <b>wrong</b> <b>deliveries,</b> poor on site coordination and collaboration, poor specialised contactors {{and lack of}} goodcommunication among parties are the main barriers within the precast supply chain. These barriers within the precast supplychain phases may result to adverse consequences on the performance of precast project delivery. Hence, the cloud computingtechnology was found to have huge potential to provide efficient collaboration systems within the precast construction...|$|R
40|$|Logistics {{has been}} the {{bottleneck}} in ecommerce, creating problems such as slow and/or <b>wrong</b> <b>deliveries,</b> lost packages, damaged goods and incorrect packing. Automation extends capacities and capabilities as justified by the vast volume of online orders. An automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) can deliver high efficiency but may be limited in flexibility {{when it comes to}} dealing with order disparities in size, shape, weight, volume and mechanical properties. The ASRS may not offer adequate scalability to adapt to growth and cope with increased seasonal demands, or deal with facility breakdowns and carry out technical maintenance. Robotics promises {{to strike a balance between}} efficiency, scalability and flexibility. This paper addresses two broad questions: (1) How can robotics create a radical paradigm shift in ecommerce logistics automation systems? (2) Who should be responsible for investing in robotic ecommerce logistics facilities and how should the benefits be shared among key stakeholders? The first question is discussed through recent industrial developments in using mobile robots to achieve robotic picking methods including goods to picker/person (G 2 P), goods to robot (G 2 R), robot to goods (R 2 G), and through the bold concepts of robotic grid warehousing and cellular warehousing (CW). The second question is discussed by extending the emerging concept of the Product Service System (PSS) to propose a Logistics Automation Service System (LASS) business model where stakeholders focus on their own core competencies while complementing each other's expertise and sharing risks and benefits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} utility of {{platform}} thinking, a design principle that {{has so far been}} applied to product development yet under-researched in service settings, for improving the value of services. A key principle of platform thinking is to balance the reuse of service components with the heterogeneity in user needs. Tuning services to specific user needs is valuable, but differentiating services when user needs are homogeneous may decrease service quality and increase cost. Using data from 676 human resource management services, this study finds that the service value is highest when the service provision is matched with the commonality potential of the services. The results indicate that using the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery</b> channel decreases the service value which eventually could decrease the service value for an organization's external customers. These empirical findings demonstrate the relevance of platform thinking for service design and challenges conventional design criteria used for optimizing service delivery...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} primarily with an examination and comparison of select {{aspects of the}} model international consumer protection laws proposed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), using the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Australia) {{as a basis for}} examination and comparison. As a secondary consideration, it also broadly examines the content of, and differences between, the model laws. The motive for this article is that any future enforceable international consumer protection regime (possibly {{in the form of an}} international treaty or convention) would need to take into account the UN, EU and OECD guidelines. A cross-comparison of those model laws, and a comparison of them with the consumer protection provisions of a well established national consumer protection law, should provide a useful starting point for the development of such a regime. The 2 ̆ 7 select aspects 2 ̆ 7 of the model laws in question are the various provisions of those laws which could relate to situations involving the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery</b> or non-delivery of goods...|$|E

40|$|The {{real estate}} and {{construction}} sectors are very important and {{integral part of the}} Malaysian economy. At a macro-level, governmental development plans in Malaysia are based on successive five year plans since 1956. For each of the five year plans, the {{real estate and}} construction sectors feature prominently in terms of value and policy implementation. The budget for the five year plans is in relation to public sector expenditure and does not include private sector initiatives. As regards real estate project delivery methods in Malaysia, the most common form is the traditional design-bid-build method. The design-build method is getting some acceptance of late, whereas infrastructure projects do adopt the build-operate-transfer method. This thesis seeks to classify, analyze and compare the various types of delivery methods and thereafter examine whether there is a methodology for selecting the best delivery method in Malaysia. Each delivery method, apart from actual project delivery itself, entails different apportionment of project risks between the owner and contractor. Choosing the right delivery method can lead to project success, whereas selecting the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery</b> method invariably leads to project failure. (cont.) For the private sector in Malaysia, the owner can pretty much choose the most commercially viable project delivery method. However, for the public sector, there are political and policy considerations, and rules and regulations which may affect the choice of project delivery method. As a developing country, there is much that Malaysia can learn from the US and other developed countries which are more advanced and experienced in terms of project delivery methods, construction and engineering. by Yew Chin Tan.

40|$|Background There are few {{interventions}} that directly address self-harming behaviour among adolescents. At {{the request of}} clinicians in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England and working with them, we redeveloped an adult SMS text-messaging intervention {{to meet the needs}} of adolescents under the care of CAMHS who self-harm. Methods We used Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to assess the feasibility of delivering it through CAMHS. We planned to recruit 27 young people who self-harm and their clinicians, working as dyads and using the intervention (TeenTEXT) for six months. Results Despite strong engagement in principle from CAMHS teams, in practice we were able to recruit only three clinician/client dyads. Of these, two dropped out because the clients were too unwell. We identified a number of barriers to implementation. These included: a context of CAMHS in crisis, with heavy workloads and high stress levels; organisational gatekeeping practices, which limited the extent to which clinicians could engage with the intervention; perceived burdensomeness and technophobia on the part of clinicians, and a belief by many clinicians that CAMHS may be the <b>wrong</b> <b>delivery</b> setting and that the intervention may have better fit with schools and universal youth services. Conclusions User-centred design principles and the use of participatory methods in intervention development are no guarantee of implementability. Barriers to implementation cannot always be foreseen, and early clinical champions may overestimate the readiness of colleagues to embrace new ideas and technologies. NPT studies have an important role to play in identifying whether or not interventions are likely to receive widespread clinical support. This study of a text-messaging intervention to support adolescents who self-harm (TeenTEXT) showed that further work is needed to identify the right delivery setting, before testing the efficacy of the intervention. This feasibility study was funded by The BUPA Foundation. Earlier developmental work was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC). The authors would like to thank everyone who helped with the earlier intervention development work and NeonTribe, who built the TeenTEXT software.

40|$|With the new {{developments}} and challenges within {{the construction industry}} improving the construction supply chain is becoming a major concern to both governments and industries. Improving the construction supply chain helps in {{improving the quality of}} construction projects reducing cost wastes delays and other disruptions. This paper discusses the analysis of material flow in the construction supply chain. The methodology consisted of preliminary investigations survey and simulation development to analyse the extent of impact that material flow has on construction projects in Jordan. Both the main survey and the investigations revealed that material flow delays are caused mainly by 3 types of delays late <b>delivery</b> <b>wrong</b> specification and material damaged on site. The highest impact regarding late deliveries was scaffolding with a 16 probability of occurrence a 2 -day delay on the activitys duration. Concrete ranked highest regarding wrong specification with a 19 probability of occurrence an 8 -day delay the activitys duration. Regarding materials damaged on site bricks ranked highest with a 9 probability of occurrence a 3 -day delay on the duration. The simulation results exhibited a delay of 50 on the projects duration and a probability of a delay occurring is 9. 2...|$|R
40|$|An {{automotive}} {{body assembly}} system consists of many individual sub- assemblies and {{sheet metal parts}} welded. The objective in this project is to identify the problem that always happens in line assembly. Then improve the problem in line assembly to overcome from the problem arise. Hence make a comparison and find a solution about body assembly to improve the problem from the data analysis. At body assembly process there are several problem could happen such as miss the spot part, dent or hump, scratch, spatter burr and hole to the body during assembly. But the major problem happen at line assembly is spot weld and men mistake. By using 4 M method which includes machine, method, material and man, this problem can be identify easily and effected. As a result there are some problem {{that contributes to the}} problem happen such as logistic problem which involve the <b>wrong</b> part <b>delivery</b> and <b>wrong</b> shipment. Besides that, man power and workability also be the problem to the line assembly. Lack of discipline, behaviour and competency of worker give a worse impact to the company. Wrong workability involves many of tools, machine and man power and affected the production and flow in line assembly. Spot welding becomes a problem when the current voltage supply is not enough and it can work properly. Lastly jigs and fixture need to be right servicing schedule to make sure the machine and tools are in good condition and avoid the problem happen used it. The method were used to make the analysis data is by making study case at AMM factory which more focus at body assembly line and problem occur during the process. From the data collected, analysis data can be done and improve the problem that always happen in line assembly. Hence it gives benefit to the company either in productivity or working environment from the solution has done...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} {{industry is a}} complex and the most people-intensive sector in the national economy. While it forms a major pillar to a nation’s socio-economic development, past {{studies have found that}} this industry, with particular reference to the building materials resources, were not sufficiently managed, leading to a waste of bad material management with time and cost overrun. Problems in the inaccuracy of data, unplanned <b>deliveries,</b> <b>wrong</b> and defective <b>deliveries</b> for instance, require the supply chain members to be coordinated. In view of this, {{there is a need to}} investigate the procurement process coordination (PPC) between the contractor and his building materials suppliers, focusing on the opportunities of the improvement in operational and customer performance. Thus, the present study looked into the coordination between the construction firm and its main building materials suppliers to allow for greater understanding in the field of supply chain management (SCM). Drawing upon two theories namely Resource Based View (RBV) and Coordination Theory (CT), it also analysed the relationship of the three critical constructs; marketing resources, PPC and firm performance. This study intended to shed light into the potential implication of the link in a more coherent and integrated approach particularly from the lens of construction supply chain. With this backdrop, the objective of the study was formulated to establish a link between these constructs (marketing resources, PPC and firm performance) and their dimensions as well as to examine the mediating role of PPC on this link. This study contributes to the new knowledge by detailing the activities involved in PPC instead of testing it in a general setting. Data for this study was gathered through a survey questionnaire. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique by examining two competing models that represent full and partial mediation. The findings revealed that marketing resources have positive and significant effects on PPC dimensions. It was also found that PPC fully mediates the relationship between marketing resources and firm performance. Result from the Sobel test provides evidence that joint operational planning and supplier relationship development appeared to confirm their role as mediating factor in the relationship between marketing resources and firm performance. In other words these two dimensions of PPC facilitate the conversion of marketing resources into firm performance. This finding was consistent with the movement of the industry players towards ‘best practices’ which emphasised on SCM, client orientation and innovativeness. Following these findings, a number of implications are offered for the {{construction industry}}. First, construction industry players should adopt and emphasis on such orientations in order to enhance their performance particularly with the operational and customer performance. Second, PPC, in particular join decision planning and supplier relationship development provided greater room for understanding on the impact of marketing resources on the effectiveness and efficiency of the construction supply chain. Finally, the industry players must act upon the importance of marketing resources in order to optimise their supply chain coordination capability...|$|R
