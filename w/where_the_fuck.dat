From 2001-2007, on the Chinese Democracy Tour, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] was used {{exclusively}} as the show opener, until 2009, when it was replaced by [...] "Chinese Democracy". It now occupies the second spot on the setlist. When performed live, the song often begins with the line: [...] "Do you know <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> you are? You're in the jungle baby!

5000|$|VersaEmerge {{completed}} their second full {{run on the}} Vans Warped Tour that began June 25, 2010 in California. They played the Glamour Kills Stage the entire tour. Kusterbeck also played a game called <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> is Sierra? with fans on every date of the tour. The game was similar to hide and seek and the first ten fans to find her received a winning card which was also a cut the line pass for their signing. On July 27, 2010, the band released the music video for the title track and first single from Fixed at Zero on their Myspace page. It was later made available on YouTube. On September 13, 2010, VersaEmerge announced {{that they would be}} headlining a tour in Fall '10 called the Vultures Unite Tour. They were joined by Anarbor, The Dangerous Summer and Conditions. The tour hit small venues across the US and also had two Canadian dates. It was claimed to be a [...] "cinematic experience". The Dangerous Summer left the tour due to an altercation between Ingelido and members of The Dangerous Summer, as well as previous issues disclosed on Kusterbeck's Tumblr page.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{autobiography}} I Am Ozzy, singer Ozzy Osbourne speaks {{at length about}} the drugged out atmosphere surrounding the sessions, stating, [...] "In {{spite of all the}} arsing around, musically those few weeks in Bel Air were the strongest we'd ever been" [...] but admitted [...] "Eventually we started to wonder <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> all the coke was coming from ... I'm telling you: that coke was the whitest, purest, strongest stuff you could ever imagine. One sniff, and you were king of the universe." [...] Osbourne also recounts the band's ongoing anxiety over the possibility of being busted, which only worsened after they went to the cinema to see The French Connection (1971), a William Friedkin film about two undercover New York City cops busting an international heroin-smuggling ring. [...] "By the time the credits rolled," [...] Osbourne recalled, [...] "I was hyperventilating." [...] Iommi describes the scene in his memoir Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath, [...] "like Tony Montana in the movie Scarface: we'd put a big pile (of cocaine) on the table, carve it all up and then we'd all have a bit, well, quite a lot." [...] In 2013, Butler admitted to Mojo magazine that heroin, too, had entered the picture: [...] "We sniffed it, we never shot up ... I didn't realize how nuts things had gotten until I went home and the girl I was with didn't recognize me." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1999, Bowie {{also said}} about his motivations and inspirations for the album: [...] Perhaps the one through-line between {{some of the}} stuff in Outside and the coming {{millennium}} is this new Pagan worship, this whole search for a new spiritual life that's going on. Because of the way we've demolished the idea of God with that triumvirate {{at the beginning of the}} century, Nietzsche, Einstein, and Freud. They really demolished everything we believed. 'Time bends, God is dead, the inner-self is made of many personalities'... wow, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> are we? ... I wonder if we have realized that the only thing we could create as 'God' was the hydrogen bomb and that the fall-out from the realization that as gods we can only seem to produce disaster is people trying to find some spiritual bonding and universality with a real nurtured inner-life. But there is also this positivism that you find now which really wasn't there at the end of the last century. Then, the general catch phrase among the artistic and literary community was that it was the end of the world. They really felt that in 1899 there was nothing else, that only complete disaster could follow. It isn't like that now. We may be a little wary or jittery about what's around the corner, but there's no feeling of everything's going to end in the year 2000. Instead, there's almost a celebratory feeling of 'right, at least we can get cracking and really pull it all together.' ...|$|E
5000|$|High Times was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Dro is mainstream street and not as odd as his backbeats with lines like [...] "I'm in the hotel with two lesbians, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> you all at?" [...] being the kind of brazen baller talk that the rapper considers his comfort zone, but he slings slang, slurs words, and uses his Atlanta drawl to stretch insults into lazy putdowns that are devastating, so take all that into account. Take high-caliber kiss-offs like the guitar-crunching [...] "Hammer Time" [...] ("If a n*gga think he better, I forgive him") and [...] "I'm Cold" [...] ("I got money like the Clampetts, Jethro") into account as well, and think of High Times as a narrow, approachable, and no-crossover type of album, plus a good reason to go searching the Young Dro mixtape section at your neighborhood bootlegger or local Internet." [...] Dave William of XXL gave the album an L, saying [...] "The tape leaves you with a number of enjoyable moments, like the previously mentioned “Odds,” and “FDB,” as well as the buddy-buddy Doe-B featuring record “Homeboyz” and a stone cold, guitar-driven track by the name of “Hammer Time.” Hip-hop fans are lucky to have a wide swath of artists experimenting with new sounds, evolving into grown ups, and collaborating with producers and artists of other genres, but we’re equally blessed to have folks like Young Dro. That is, the same Dro you grew to enjoy when you first met him when he first introduced us to shoulder leanin’ and “pimpin’ in linen and salamander sandals." ...|$|E
