5000|$|The lake <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus clupeaformis) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} <b>whitefish</b> from North America. Lake <b>whitefish</b> are found throughout much of Canada {{and parts of the}} northern United States, including all of the Great Lakes. The lake <b>whitefish</b> is sometimes referred to as a [...] "humpback" [...] fish due to the small size of the head in relation to the length of the body. It is a valuable commercial fish, and also occasionally taken by sport fishermen. Smoked, refrigerated, vacuum-packed lake <b>whitefish</b> fillets are available in North American grocery stores. Other vernacular names used for this fish include Otsego bass, Sault <b>whitefish,</b> gizzard fish, common <b>whitefish,</b> eastern <b>whitefish,</b> Great Lakes <b>whitefish,</b> humpback <b>whitefish,</b> inland <b>whitefish</b> and <b>whitefish.</b> The scientific genus name Coregonus (co-regg'-on-us) means [...] "angle eye" [...] in Greek and the species name clupeaformis means [...] "herring-shaped" [...] in Latin.|$|R

2500|$|The omul has {{traditionally}} been regarded as a subspecies of the Arctic cisco Coregonus autumnalis. However, recent genetic studies have shown it actually belongs to the circumpolar Coregonus lavaretus-clupeaformis complex of lake <b>whitefishes,</b> which also has other members in Lake Baikal, {{and it is now}} considered its own species within Coregonus. The four or five traditionally accepted subpopulations of omul within Lake Baikal are: North Baikal (северобайкальский), Selenga (селенгинский), Chivyrkui (чивыркуйский) and Posolsk (посольский). [...] These vary in size, feeding behaviors and preferred spawning habitats. [...] The extent of their reproductive isolation is debated.|$|E

40|$|<b>Whitefish</b> Coregoninae spp. are an {{important}} subsistence fish harvested year-round in the Kuskokwim River drainage. Conservation concerns regarding reduced size and abundance of broad <b>whitefish</b> Coregonus nasus resulted in the 1992 creation of subsistence regulations for <b>whitefish</b> in <b>Whitefish</b> Lake. To understand the dynamics of <b>whitefish</b> utilizing <b>Whitefish</b> Lake, we used a flexible picket weir and deployed Floy tags to assess the abundance, age at length composition and migratory patterns of broad <b>whitefish,</b> humpback <b>whitefish,</b> C. pidschian, and least cisco C. sardinella between 2001 and 2003. Emigrations were highest in 2003 for broad <b>whitefish</b> with 254 leaving the lake. Humpback <b>whitefish</b> and least cisco emigrations were highest in 2002 with 31, 985 and 26, 195, respectively. Inter year tag returns indicated fidelity to the lake. Maximum ages were 20, 29, and 14 for broad and humpback <b>whitefish</b> and least cisco, respectively. Extensive migrations were indicated through the return of tagged <b>whitefish</b> harvested by subsistence fishers between the village of Tuluksak (rkm 192) and Medfra (rkm 863).

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the ecology of}} sympatric <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) forms in a subarctic lake, northern Finland. Despite of rather common occurrence of sympatric <b>whitefish</b> forms in the northern hemisphere, limited amount of information exist about their ecology and morphological divergence. Furthermore, <b>whitefish</b> form data is usually gathered in various different lakes and collective studies of the various ecological aspects in a single lake has been scarce. Thus, this thesis focuses on the ecology of sympatric <b>whitefish</b> forms in Lake Muddusjärvi. The main objectives were to examine the level of morphological divergence, morphometry-feeding environment relationship and niche segregation of sympatric <b>whitefish</b> forms. In addition, the impacts of predation on sympatric <b>whitefish</b> forms were evaluated. Morphometric and meristic analyses indicated divergence of <b>whitefish</b> population into three distinct forms. The most pronounced differences between sympatric <b>whitefish</b> forms wer...|$|R
