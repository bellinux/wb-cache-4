Therefore,the University of Muhammadiyah Malang dubbed the "Campus Holidays" {{because a lot of}} the beauty contained in it. However, in this case the west area of this campus is still there who do not have land use values. The road construction will be build on this location.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve visual {{recognition}} of stairs in upward and downward motion, sensory test {{was carried out by}} 10 vision-impaired persons. The result shows that the appearance of finishing materials (for example, combinations, sizes, colors) have influence on visual recognition of stairs. The most influential element was the ratio of the brightness between border and tread. The second most influential element was the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> border at <b>tread</b> (in case <b>of</b> going down), and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> border at <b>tread</b> and rise (in case of going up).

50|$|The sharper the curve, {{the greater}} the lateral {{displacement}} necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500 m or 1,500 feet radius) the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the wheel <b>tread</b> {{is not enough to}} achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.|$|R
50|$|PAX {{tires are}} {{measured}} in the metric system exclusively unlike the mixed English and metric measurements prevalent in conventional tires. For example a conventional passenger car tire might have the designation 245/45-18, indicating a tread section 245 mm wide, with an aspect ratio of 45% (i.e., the sidewall height is 45% the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> section), mounted on an 18 inch conventional wheel. The similarly sized PAX tire was designated 245-680R460A, indicating the same 245 mm tread section, but a 680 mm overall diameter (a specification not in the conventional passenger car tire nomenclature), the R, meaning radial construction, a 460 mm wheel seat diameter (approximately 18.1 inches) and A for asymmetric, meaning that the wheel is asymmetric, or PAX system.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the aircraft landing loads and traction facility to study the braking and cornering characteristics, including the drag-force and cornering-force friction coefficients, of 30 by 11. 5 - 14. 5, type VIII aircraft tires with five different tread patterns. Test data were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg at ground speeds from 5 knots to 100 knots. The results of this investigation indicate that a <b>tread</b> pattern consisting <b>of</b> transverse cuts across the entire <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> slightly improved the tire traction performance on wet surfaces. The braking and cornering capability of the tires was degraded by thin-film lubrication and tire hydroplaning effects on the wet runway surfaces. The braking capability of the tires decreased when the yaw angle was increased...|$|R
40|$|The characteristics, {{which include}} the cornering-force and drag-force {{friction}} coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg and at ground speeds from approximately 5 to 90 knots. The results indicate that a tread pattern with pinholes in the ribs reduces the tire cornering capability at high yaw angles on a damp surface but improves cornering on a dry surface. A tread pattern which has transverse grooves across the entire <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded runway surface. The cornering capability of all the tires is degraded at high ground speeds by thin film lubrication and/or tire hydroplaning effects. Alterations to the conventional tread pattern provide only marginal improvements in the tire cornering capability which suggests that runway surface treatments {{may be a more}} effective way of improving aircraft ground performance during wet operations...|$|R

40|$|Summary. A multi–scale {{approach}} for the efficient computation <b>of</b> <b>treaded</b> tires in rolling contact with rough road surfaces is outlined.

This decoupling enables for a very detailed contact analysis <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> block with the rough road surface taking nonlinear and inelastic constitutive rubber behavior into account. An important ingredient of the pro-posed approach is a novel coupling scheme between the stationary moving tire structure and the transient dynamic response <b>of</b> the <b>tread</b> blocks. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{concepts}} are described for use singly {{or in combination}} to improve aircraft braking. All involve {{a thin layer of}} aluminum covering {{all or part of the}} runway. Advantage would derive from faster heat conduction from the tire-runway interface. Heating <b>of</b> <b>tread</b> surface with consequent softening and loss of friction coefficient should be reduced. Equations are developed indicating that at least 99 percent of friction heat should flow into the aluminum.
