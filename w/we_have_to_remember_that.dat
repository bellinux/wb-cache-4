But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> this missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E

60|$|The {{mistake was}} due to a very clever woman making a blunder and not {{retrieving}} it.

Yet, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> six consecutive days of rehearsing the leading part of The Fallen Age, at the New Gaiety Theatre where the plaster is not yet properly dry, might have brought about an unhingement of spirits which, again, might have led to eccentricities.|$|E

60|$|As to the {{reference}} with which Voltaire impatiently concludes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{the work was}} being printed at Geneva as {{it came out in}} Paris. It was afterwards reprinted as a whole both at Geneva (1777) and at Lausanne (1778). An edition appeared at Leghorn in 1770, and another at Lucca in 1771. Immediately after the completion of the EncyclopÃ¦dia there began to appear volumes of selections from it. The compilers of these anthologies (for instance of an Esprit de l'EncydopÃ©die published at Geneva in 1768) were free from all intention of proselytising. They meant only to turn a more or less honest penny by serving up in neat duodecimos the liveliest, most curious, and most amusing pieces {{to be found in the}} immense mass of the folios of the original.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{the bulk}} of this great {{organization}} of newspapers and periodicals and all the wide distribution of books that goes on to-day are extremely recent things. This new nexus of print has {{grown up in the}} lifetime of four or five generations, and it is undergoing constant changes. We are apt to forget its extreme newness in history and to disregard the profound difference in mental conditions it makes between our own times and any former period. It is impossible to believe that thus far it is anything but a sketch and intimation of what it will presently be. It has grown. No man foresaw it; no one planned it. We of this generation have grown up with it and are in the habit of behaving as though this nexus had always been with us and as though it would certainly remain with us. The latter conclusion is almost wilder than the former.|$|E
6000|$|Whatever we {{may think}} of the {{practice}} of writing the action as well as the words for the player, nobody would now dispute the wisdom of what Diderot says as to the part that pantomime fills in the highest kind of dramatic representation. We must agree with his repeated laments over the indigence, for purposes of full and adequate expression, of every language that ever has existed or ever can exist.[258] [...] "My dear master," [...] he wrote to Voltaire on the occasion of a performance of Tancred, [...] "if you could have seen Clairon passing across the stage, her knees bending under her, her eyes closed, her arms falling stiff by her side as if they were dead; if you heard the cry that she uttered when she perceives Tancred, you would remain more convinced than ever that silence and pantomime have sometimes a pathos that all the resources of speech can never approach."[259] If we wonder that he should have thought it worth while to lay so much emphasis on what seems so obvious, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> it did not seem at all obvious to people who were accustomed to the substitution of a mannered and symmetrical declamation for the energetic variety and manifold exuberance of passion and judgment in the daily lives of men.|$|E
50|$|During World War I Genoese shipyards {{were very}} active, {{importing}} {{vast quantities of}} materials necessary for the war effort, and between thirty thousand and eighty thousand Genoese left for the battlefront.

Important urban and architectural works were constructed under Fascism including: Piazza Dante which includes the Piacentini's Tower, Piazza della Vittoria with itsArco della Vittoria, and the Bisagno stream water tunnel.

40|$|The name Perineology is a {{neologism}} {{which means}} {{the study of the}} perineum. It has been used {{for the first time in}} Italy [1]. To understand how this name is becoming a concept, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> some relevant steps of its story. In the beginning, there was gynecology and urology: both disciplines studying â often independently and separately â the functioning of the pelvic organs and the pelvic floor. The foundation of the ICS (International Continence Society) in 1970 was the first step to a multidisciplinary approach. The introduction of new and more advanced investigational techniques increased our interest in an understanding of the dynamic interaction between lower urinary tract and the pelvic floor...|$|R
60|$|However {{this may}} have been, it may be confessed that Byron {{presents}} less of the flame of his revolutionary prototypes, and {{too much of the}} ashes. He came {{at the end of the}} experiment. But it is only a question of proportion. The ashes belong as much and as necessarily to the methods of the Revolution in that phase, as do the blaze, that first told men of possible light and warmth, and the fire, which yet smoulders with abundant life underneath the gray cinders. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Byron came in the midst of a reaction; a reaction of triumph for the partisans of darkness and obstruction, who were assured that the exploded fragments of the old order would speedily grow together again, and a reaction of despondency for those who had filled themselves with illimitable and peremptory hopes. Silly Byronical votaries, who only half understood their idol, and loved him for a gloom that in their own case was nothing but a graceful veil for selfishness and mental indolence, saw and felt only the melancholy conclusion, and had not travelled a yard in the burning path that led to it. They hugged Conrad's haughty misery, but they would have trembled at the thought of Conrad's perilous expedition. They were proud despondent LarÃ¦s after their manner, 'lords of themselves, that heritage of woe,' but the heritage would have been still more unbearable, if it had involved Lara's bodily danger.|$|E
60|$|But {{indeed the}} matter of that {{declaration}} of war is as plain as daylight; the Italian national consciousness has not at first that direct sense of the German danger {{that exists in the}} minds of the three northern Allies. To the Italian the traditional enemy is Austria, and this war is not primarily a war for any other end than the emancipation of Italy. Moreover <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> for years there has been serious commercial friction between France and Italy, and considerable mutual elbowing in North Africa. Both Frenchmen and Italians are resolute to remedy this now, but the restoration of really friendly and trustful relations is not to be done in a day. It has been an extraordinary misfortune for Great Britain that instead of boldly taking over her shipping from its private owners and using it all, regardless of their profit, in the interests of herself and her allies, her government has permitted so much of it as military and naval needs have not requisitioned to continue to ply for gain, which the government itself has shared by a tax on war profits. The Anglophobe elements in Italian public life have made the utmost of this folly or laxity in relation more particularly to the consequent dearness of coal in Italy. They have carried on an amazingly effective campaign in which this British slackness with the individual profiteer, is represented as if it were the deliberate greed of the British state. This certainly contributed very much to fortify Italy's disinclination to slam the door on the German connection.|$|E
60|$|We have {{at first}} some {{difficulty}} in realising how he police could know {{the contents of}} an obscure author's desk. For one thing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Paris, {{though it had been}} enormously increased in the days of Law and the System (1719-20), was still of a comparatively manageable size. In 1720, though the population of the whole realm was only fourteen or fifteen millions, that of Paris had reached no less a figure than a million and a half. After the explosion of the System, its artificial expansion naturally came to an end. By the middle of the century the highest estimate of the population does not make it much more than eight hundred thousand.[44] This, unlike the socially unwholesome and monstrous agglomerations of Paris or London in our own time, was a population over which police supervision might be made tolerably effective. It was more like a very large provincial town. Again, the inhabitants were marked off into groups or worlds with a definiteness that is now no longer possible. One-fifth of the population, for instance, consisted of domestic servants.[45] There were between twenty-eight and thirty thousand professional beggars.[46] The legal circle was large, and was deeply engrossed by its own interests and troubles. The world of authorship, though extremely noisy and profoundly important, still made only a small group. One effect of a censorship is to produce much gossip and whispering about suspected productions before they see the light, and these whispers let the police into as many secrets as they choose to know.|$|E

30|$|The dipolar {{structure}} {{occupies a}} privileged {{place between the}} theories that are dedicated to the microstructure.
