The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began {{on the evening of}} 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying {{a large portion of the}} street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{started in}} all six matches that Germany {{played at the}} Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to be saved in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This {{was the first time}} Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E

5|$|On 19 July, III./JG 51 {{were confronted}} by Defiants of No. 141 Squadron south of Folkestone. As the German pilots were now {{aware of the}} Defiant's lack of forward armament, they soon gained the {{advantage}} in combat and claimed 11 Defiants shot down in 8 minutes. Oesau was credited with one Defiant, taking his score to 19. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> of JG 51 to reach double digits in World War II. RAF losses record six Defiants destroyed and two damaged.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's column <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> {{to reach}} the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and {{the speed of the}} cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E

South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010.

5|$|This element <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> {{discovered}} by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity. Pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated radium.|$|E
5|$|The Front for Victory {{recovered}} {{the majority in}} both chambers of the Congress during the 2011 presidential elections, when Cristina Kirchner was re-elected for a second term. The party had projects to amend the constitution and allow indefinite reelections, but lacked the supermajority required for it. A victory at the 2013 midterm elections would have given such majority, but the party was defeated in most provinces. Sergio Massa, a former cabinet minister of the Kirchners, won in the Buenos Aires Province by nearly 10 points with his new party, the Renewal Front. Argentina lacked a big opposition party {{since the collapse of}} the Radical Civic Union in 2001. Instead, Massa created an alternative party that also stood for Peronism. However, the party still retained a simple majority in Congress. This election <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> where teenagers from 16 to 18 could vote. President Kirchner, who had undergone brain surgery some weeks before, was hospitalized during the election and unable to join the campaign.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} a Powers Picture Plays {{directed}} by Edwin August and {{distributed by the}} Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film's production number was 0101. The screen play was written by Jeanie MacPherson who also {{played the role of}} The Girl. Simon Louvish, author of Cecil B. DeMille: A Life in Art, states this uncredited screenplay <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to be authored by MacPherson. Louvish also refers to this film as a two-reeler. Lon Chaney and Robert Z. Leonard had previously worked together for the Ferris Hartman Troupe. Three years prior to the release of the film, the two were involved in the production of musical comedies for the Troupe. In 1918, Leonard would later direct his wife, Mae Murry, and Lon Chaney in Danger, Go Slow.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
