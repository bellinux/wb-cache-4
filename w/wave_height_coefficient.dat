40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of a numerical investigation, presented in the part 1 companion paper, two methods of directional analysis, the maximum likelihood method (MLM) and the Bayesian directional method (BDM) are applied to over 80 field data sets. These cover a wide range of environmental conditions, for which multidirectional, partially reflective sea states exist. The results show that trends similar to those found using the numerical simulations are observed in the field estimates of relative predictions of incident significant <b>wave</b> <b>height,</b> average reflection <b>coefficients,</b> main directions and directional spreading. It is concluded that overall the BDM produces the more accurate results when applied to real sea waves...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of gravity waves in an emerged three-layer porous medium is considered in this paper. Based {{on the assumption}} that the flow can be described by Darcy's Law, an asymptotic theory is developed for small-amplitude long waves. This leads to a weakly nonlinear Boussinesq-type diffusion equation for the <b>wave</b> <b>height,</b> with <b>coefficients</b> dependent on the conductivities and depths of each layer. In the limit of equal conductivities of all layers, the equation reduces to the single-layer result recorded in the literature. The model equations are numerically integrated in the case of an incident monochromatic wave hitting the layers. The results exhibit dissipation and also a downstream net height rise at infinity. Wave transmission coefficient in three-layer porous media with conductivity of mangrove is discussed. Numerically, {{propagation of}} an initial solitary wave through a porous medium shows the emergence of wave reflection and transmission that both evolve as permanent waves. Additionally we examine the impact of a solitary gravity wave on a porous medium breakwater...|$|R

The {{efficiency of}} the breakwater is presented {{as a function of the}} transmission, the reflection and the wave energy loss coefficients. Regular waves with wide ranges of <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> and periods and a constant water depth were used. Different characteristics of the caisson structure and the supporting pile system were tested such as, caisson draft (D), caisson width (B), piles diameter (d), and the space between piles (G). It was found that, the proposed breakwater dissipated about 10 to 30 % of the incident wave energy. Also, when the relative breakwater draft (kD) was more than 0. 8; the {{efficiency of the}} proposed breakwater became high in decreasing the transmitted <b>wave</b> <b>height.</b> The reflection <b>coefficient</b> was not be affected by the increasing or decreasing the breakwater width or pile characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{estimation}} of sea-state bias (SSB) from sea height residuals is extended with a parametric fitting process and a successive smoothing {{of the remaining}} residuals. This hybrid method essentially produces a nonparametric SSB model {{in the form of}} a smooth grid in a 2 -dimensional space determined by significant <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> and backscatter <b>coefficient.</b> The hybrid method allows a much higher resolution than parametric models, without the disadvantage of the direct method’s limited wind speed / <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> domain. The use of sea height residuals as input data allows {{estimation of}} a realistic SSB model with only a few months of data. With state-of-the-art geophysical corrections the hybrid SSB model can be constructed with a high level of accuracy. The impact of errors in the mean sea surface model and tide models appears marginal. Errors in the ionospheric correction, which has a geographical distribution similar to wind speed and <b>wave</b> <b>height,</b> tend to leak into the SSB model. The <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> and backscatter both show trends as a function of time. <b>Wave</b> <b>heights</b> appear to drop over time, but backscatter shows trends either way. This results in trends in SSB and hence sea level that may not be “real”. The different trends in SSB between TOPEX Side A and Side B, as well as between the CSR SSB model and our hybrid model, poses challenges on the estimation of sea level change to better than 0. 2 mm/yr.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} {{advanced}} directional analysis techniques have mainly centred on incident wave fields. In {{the study of}} coastal structures, however, partially reflective wave fields are commonly present. In the near structure field, phase locked methods can be successfully applied. In the far field, non-phased locked methods are more appropriate. In this paper, the accuracy of two non-phased locked methods of directional analysis, the maximum likelihood method (MLM) and the Bayesian directional method (BDM) have been quantitatively evaluated using numerical simulations for the case of multidirectional waves with partial reflections. It is shown that the results {{are influenced by the}} ratio of distance from the reflector (L) to the length of the time series (S) used in the spectral analysis.

The wave energy flux or wave power can be approximated using parameterized sea states. Wave power scales with significant <b>wave</b> <b>height,</b> characteristic <b>wave</b> period and water depth. In this approach, the significant <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> were obtained from ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite) data which have been calibrated. However, as the characteristic wave period is rarely specified and therefore must be estimated from other variables when information about the wave spectra is unknown. Here, the characteristic wave period was calculated with an empirical model that utilizes altimeter estimates of <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> and backscatter <b>coefficient</b> originally proposed. For the Indonesian region, wave power energy is calculated over two periods of one year each and was compared with the results from global hindcast carried out with a recent release of wave model WAVEWATCH III.

In these locations, about 20 ??? 30 kW/m (90 th percentile: 30 ??? 50 kW/m, 99 th percentile: 40 ??? 60 kW/m) wave power energy on average has been found around south of Java island during 2010.

The validation showed that the model could reproduce the observations well. The relative root-mean-square error varies from 5 % to 7. 6 % for laboratory data, and from 10. 3 % to 18. 6 % for field data.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to {{estimate}} the <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> for several return periods in order to use them in coastal constructions. <b>Wave</b> <b>height</b> measurements collected from Galle, Sri Lanka were analyzed. Analysis was separately performed for sea, swell and overall waves, season wise. Peak Over Threshold method (POT) was used for the sample selection. The possible range of threshold values were identified by using the Mean residual life plot and the specific threshold value was selected using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). Using the POT method, the GPD was fitted for the sampled data and the special type of GPD was identified statistically. Further diagnostic plots were obtained to ensure the validity of the distribution. Return levels were calculated for several return periods and the confidence intervals were constructed for the return levels. Exponential distributions were the best fitted distributions for south-west (SW) monsoon and October–November (ON) season for sea <b>wave</b> <b>heights,</b> while the Beta distribution was the best fitted distribution for swell <b>wave</b> <b>heights.</b> Pareto distribution fits well with the overall <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> for south-west monsoon and overall <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> were fitted well with Beta distribution for October–November (ON) and March–April (MA) seasons.

If one is primarily interested in extreme <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> then it is possible to restrict one's attention to events which are sufficiently separated in time to be effectively independently (and possibly even identically) distributed. However the independence assumption is not tenable for the description of many other aspects of <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> behaviour, such as the persistence of calm periods. For this one has to take account of the serial correlation structure of observed <b>wave</b> <b>heights,</b> the seasonal behaviour of the important statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, and in fact the entire seasonal probability distribution of <b>wave</b> <b>heights.</b> In other words the observations have to be regarded as a time series...|$|R

The main objective of this work has been to study the statistical properties of individual parameters in successive waves; the <b>wave</b> crest <b>height,</b> the <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> and the <b>wave</b> period. In severe sea states the <b>wave</b> crest <b>heights</b> exhibit a nonlinear behavior, which must be reflected in the models. An existing marginal distribution that uses second order Stokes-type nonlinearity is transformed to a two-dimensional distribution by use of the two–dimensional Rayleigh distribution. This model only includes sum frequency effects. A two-dimensional distribution is also established by transforming a second order model including both sum and different frequency effects. Both models are based on the narrow-band assumption, and the effect of finite water depth is included. A parametric <b>wave</b> crest <b>height</b> distribution proposed by Forristall (2000) has been extended to two dimensions by transformation of the two-dimensional Weibull distribution. Two successive <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> are modeled by a Gaussian copula, which {{is referred to as the}} Nataf model. Results with two initial distributions for the transformation are presented, the Næss (1985) model and a two-parameter Weibull distribution, where the latter is in best agreement with data. The results are compared with existing models. The Nataf model has also been used for modeling three successive <b>wave</b> <b>heights.</b> Results show that the Nataf transformation of three successive <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> can be approximated by a first order autoregression model. This means that the distribution of the <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> given the previous <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> is independent of the <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> prior to the previous <b>wave</b> <b>height.</b> The simulation of successive <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> can be done directly without simulating the time series of the complete surface elevation. Successive wave periods are modeled with the Nataf transformation by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution and a generalized Gamma distribution as the initial distribution, where the latter is in best agreement with data. Results for the marginal and two-dimensional distributions are compared with existing models. In practical applications, it is often of interest to consider successive wave periods with corresponding <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> exceeding a certain threshold. Results show that the distribution for successive wave periods when the corresponding <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> exceed the root-mean-square value of the <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> can be approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{distribution of the}} <b>height</b> of sea <b>waves</b> in deep water has been modelled using the Rayleigh (Longuet-Higgins 1952) and Weibull distributions (Forristall 1978). Depth-induced wave breaking leading to restriction on the ratio of <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> to water depth require new parameterisations of these or other distributional forms for shallow water. Glukhovskiy (1966) proposed a Weibull parameterisation accommodating depth-limited breaking, modified by van Vledder (1991). Battjes and Groenendijk (2000) suggested a two-part Weibull-Weibull distribution.
