500|$|On 18 April 2016, an {{official}} statement was released, cancelling {{the last leg}} of the RoXXXette 30th Anniversary Tour due to concerns about Marie Fredriksson's health. As her doctors have advised her to refrain from playing live, there will be no further Roxette tours. Fredriksson stated: [...] "Sadly, now my touring days are over and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that has followed us on our long and winding journey." [...] Gessle added: [...] "The joyride on the road is over now – but we sure had fun, didn't we?" ...|$|E
500|$|On April 25, 2007, the duo {{announced}} that they would embark {{on a tour of}} Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: [...] "Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> tour to {{the far reaches of the}} Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary." [...] Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.|$|E

2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner {{has the right to}} say them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think that we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> to the ultimate end and put that chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close to maybe not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal the House Republicans also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E

6000|$|The old man knew he understood, {{and so he}} did not explain. He said: [...] "I {{am going}} to Europe, to take my family there.

If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> thing off my hands, I reckon I can let you have it in 'most any shape you say.
