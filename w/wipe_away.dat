25|$|The {{victory for}} Anthony Davidson and Minassian for Peugeot in the 2010 1000km of Silverstone {{was but a}} small {{consolation}} for the disastrous Le Mans race but did <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> the bad memories of Silverstone in 2008. The second place was enough for the Oreca team to be crowned as the 2010 champions, who were using a Peugeot instead their own race winning chassis from the 2009 event. This time Lapierre was co-driven by Stéphane Sarrazin. Audi were third with the R15 TDI of Capello and Timo Bernhard.|$|E
25|$|Some of this {{development}} was also encouraged by Ireland's dominant nationalist ideology of that era, which wanted to <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> all physical reminders of Ireland's colonial past. An extreme {{example of this}} kind of thinking was the destruction of Nelson's Pillar in O'Connell Street in 1966. This statue of the famous British admiral was a Dublin landmark for a century, but was blown up by a small bomb shortly before the 50-year commemorations of the Easter Rising. In 2003, the Pillar was replaced as a landmark by the Dublin Spire which was erected on the same spot. A 120 m tall tapered metal pole, it is the tallest structure of Dublin city centre, visible for miles. It was assembled from seven pieces with the largest crane available in Ireland and is the tallest street sculpture in the world.|$|E

500|$|Gielgud was {{uninterested in}} {{religion}} or politics. As a boy {{he had been}} fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner {{not long after the}} Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, [...] "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as he was talking to the prime minister, Clement Attlee, the answer was [...] "10 Downing Street". In his Who's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud's personality was [...] "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, [...] "the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{image of}} life as a sea voyage to the Kingdom of Heaven in the first recitative comes from the opening of the Gospel reading: [...] "There He went on board a ship and passed over and came into His own city" [...] (...)

[...] This joy is coupled with a yearning for death, a theme that is present until {{the very end of the}} work. The concluding chorale is the sixth stanza of Johann Franck's hymn [...] "" [...] (1653), which also alludes to the ship imagery, saying [...] "Löse meines Schiffleins Ruder, bringe mich an sichern Port" [...] (release the rudder of my little ship, bring me to the secure harbor). Before the chorale, the final lines of the opening aria taken from Revelation 7:17 ("there my Savior himself will <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> my tears") are heard once more.|$|E

500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I will gladly {{carry the}} Cross), is in bar form AAB, with two stollen (A) {{followed}} by an abgesang (B). The first stollen starts with a ritornello for full orchestra, anticipating in counterpoint the rising and then falling motif of the bass soloist, mounting to an anguished augmented second marking the word [...] (Cross), followed by descending sighing figures signalling the bearing of the cross. After the entry of the soloist, with its long and expressive melismatic lines, the three groups of strings and oboes accompany in counterpoint and echoing responses drawn from motifs of the opening ritornello. The ritornello is then taken up in the second stollen, but with significant variations because of the differing text: [...] "It leads me after my torments to God in the Promised Land". After {{a repeat of the}} opening ritornello, the final abgesang illustrates the words, [...] "There at last I will lay my sorrow in the grave, there my Savior himself will <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> my tears." [...] Declamatory triplets, dramatically spanning the whole bass register, are responded to by sighing motifs in the accompaniment. A reprise of the orchestral ritornello brings the aria to a close.|$|E

The Evansville Shipyard was the nation's largest inland producer of LSTs.

There is no setting at liberty the people that are bruised unless this age-long bruising machinery is stopped. If we are ever to call the poor and the maimed and the halt to the banquet of creation, the program of the revolution must be inaugurated. The Heavenly Father may know we have need of all these things, and He may have provided for these needs in the limitless resources of nature, but we never can have them for the people except by seeking the kingdom of social justice and human brotherhood — which is the Kingdom of God — which is the social vision of the social revolution.|$|E

2500|$|... "A terrible cry" [...] heralds the {{entrance}} of Lucky, a silent, baggage-burdened slave with a rope tied around his neck, and Pozzo, his arrogant and imperious master, who holds the other end and stops now to rest. Pozzo barks abusive orders at Lucky, which are always quietly followed, while acting civilly though tersely towards the other two. Pozzo enjoys a selfish snack of chicken and wine, before casting the bones to the ground, which Estragon gleefully claims. Having been in a dumbfounded state of silence ever since the arrival of Pozzo and Lucky, Vladimir finally finds his voice to shout criticisms at Pozzo for his mistreatment of Lucky. Pozzo ignores this and explains his intention to sell Lucky, who begins to cry. Estragon takes pity and tries to <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> Lucky's tears, but, as he approaches, Lucky violently kicks him in the shin. Pozzo then rambles nostalgically but vaguely {{about his relationship with}} Lucky over the years, before offering Vladimir and Estragon some compensation for their company. Estragon begins to beg for money when Pozzo instead suggests that Lucky can [...] "dance" [...] and [...] "think" [...] for their entertainment. Lucky's dance, [...] "the Net", is clumsy and shuffling; Lucky's [...] "thinking" [...] is a long-winded and disjointed monologueit is the first and only time that Lucky speaks. The soliloquy begins as a relatively coherent and academic lecture on theology but quickly dissolves into mindless verbosity, escalating in both volume and speed, that agonises the others until Vladimir finally pulls off Lucky's hat, stopping him in mid-sentence. Pozzo then has Lucky pack up his bags, and they hastily leave.|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned <b>wipe</b> <b>away</b> in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
