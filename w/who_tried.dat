5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E

5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E
