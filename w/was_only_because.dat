5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, and it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets {{that were used in}} the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Brotherhood then {{returned}} for tag team action with consecutive losses to RybAxel and the Usos; after the latter loss on April 21, dissension was teased between the brothers when Cody shoved Goldust and left by himself. After that, more tension was built up when Cody began frequently losing singles matches while Goldust frequently won; Goldust notably scored wins over Alberto Del Rio and Curtis Axel, two opponents which Cody lost to. When Cody managed {{a win over}} Damien Sandow in May, it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> he resorted to cheating. The team disbanded at Payback on June 1 when they lost to RybAxel, with Cody telling Goldust {{to look for a}} new partner, after he felt he was the weak link in the team. Cody then attempted to find a new tag team partner for Goldust, such as Sin Cara or R-Truth, but the new teams still lost their tag matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} more modern {{submarines}} to blockade the Dardanelles made the B-class boats redundant {{and they were}} mostly withdrawn to Malta in 1915. They were transferred to Venice after Italy entered the war, where B10 became the first submarine to be sunk by air attack in 1916. The B-class submarines were transferred back to Malta in late 1916 as {{they were no longer}} deemed suitable for combat. In mid-1917 they were converted to surface patrol boats and sent to patrol the Otranto Barrage. They proved to be unreliable and were soon sent back to Malta where they were finally paid off. Only B3 was still in commission when the war ended and that <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> it was being used for experimental work and serving as a target to train anti-submarine forces. All surviving boats were sold for scrap in 1919–21.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of {{the game}} {{was based on the}} final novel in Nishitani's trilogy, Tensei no Shuuen, {{although}} taking its title from the first novel, Megami Tensei. Nishitani was deeply involved in planning the game, contributing suggestions and advice for the project. According to Okada, a major issue during development was faithfully following the novel's plot due to the limited hardware space on the Famicom cartridge, together with the necessity of creating a compelling gameplay experience. With this in mind, the team picked out key parts the novel's plot to include in the game while cutting out non-essential elements. One element that was not included was the questionable morality of the main protagonist, which was a prominent feature in the novels. Suzuki later commented that it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> they were working with Namco, which included mature character designs and the heavy use of religion in its narrative, that the game was ever released. The Cerberus demon, which would become a recurring feature in later Megami Tensei games, was a homage to the narrative of Nishitani's trilogy, at the same time emulating the trend for games to have a marketable mascot or character.|$|E
5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} visited {{the school in}} April they found it empty, to their delight. However, this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> the {{students}} were on Easter holidays and soon returned. H. Gaunt, the headmaster, {{was concerned about the}} mysterious arrival of numerous government inspectors on 25 April, who left without telling them anything. When he contacted the Ministry of Works and Planning he was informed that a government department would be moving into the school, forcing him to move the students {{for the second time in}} two years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the folk}} tales, {{he is always}} portrayed as a pious Hindu, being younger than Akbar, and being morally strict {{in the midst of}} {{opposing}} Muslim courtiers, who are shown plotting against him; his success <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> of his skill and he convinces the Emperor to favour Hinduism over Islam. He is thus depicted as acquiring religious, political and personal influence over Akbar, using his intelligence and sharp tongue and never resorting to violence. However, historically he never played such a role.|$|E
50|$|The statute reads more {{naturally}} as {{a command}} to buy insurance {{than as a}} tax, and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command {{that it is necessary}} to reach the taxing power question. And it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> we have a duty to construe a statute to save it, if fairly possible, that §5000A can be interpreted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving construction.|$|R

Last but not least, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> of encouragement, commitment, patience, benevolence, professionalism, and brightness of my academic advisor, Prof. Kimura Hirotsune, that the quality of my works is exceeding my own expectation. There is no single word can express my feeling and grateful for everything I have ever received from those tender persons. Notwithstanding of the new challenging atmospheres, living alone in Japan for around 2 years without mastering local language is indeed not an ideal choice. Fortunately, there are many Japanese classmates who are keenly lending their hand whenever I face a problem. I would like to devote special thanks to Ryosuke Soyama, my tutor, to whom I often ask for help. I would also like to convey my sympathy to Makiko Morishima, Hiroyuk...|$|R
25|$|In response, Zemskov {{wrote that}} the charge that Zemskov {{allegedly}} did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers {{is that they do}} not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with “old” one, it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1920s when Leo Fitzmaurice, {{the brother}} of Trans-Atlantic aviator James Fitzmaurice, {{organised}} a street football league in the Drumcondra / Whitehall area of Northside Dublin. This league originally featured five teams – Drumcondra Road, Ormonde Road, Hollybank Road, Richmond Road and Home Farm Road. In 1928 the latter two, led by Don Seery and Brendan Menton Sr. respectively merged to form Home Farm Football Club. Menton later {{became president of the}} Football Association of Ireland while Seery was the father of Ronan Seery, the founder of Dublin City. The new club began to play their home games at Griffith Avenue playing in black and gold stripes. However this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> their first set of shirts were purchased at a jumble sale and these were the only colours available. By the next season, the colours were changed to blue and white hoops.|$|E
25|$|Peckford's assertions have, in turn, been {{challenged}} by Howard Leeson, {{who was then}} the Saskatchewan Deputy Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs and present during all of the negotiations that night. He claimed that, while the officials did work from Newfoundland's draft, it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> it was largely similar to the Kitchen Accord, which had already been developed and agreed to by the governments of Ontario and Saskatchewan and was known to the federal government. Further, Peckford played only a minor role that evening, entering later, with the majority of the negotiating being done by Blakeney and Davis. Leeson concluded that Davis and Lougheed were the most important players in securing an agreement. In his opinion, the presence in the National Archives of Canada of the Kitchen Accord leaves no doubt about its existence {{and it was one of}} several crucial linkages in the patriation negotiations.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 {{season was}} {{impacted}} by sanctions {{imposed by the}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for violations that dated {{back as far as}} the late 1990s. On February 1, 2002, the NCAA imposed a two-year bowl ban, a reduction in athletic scholarships of 21 over a three-year period and five years of probation. The NCAA sanctioned the University after they found 11 major violations and five minor ones as part of their investigation that included boosters who provided players and coaches with improper benefits in violation of NCAA rules. On September 17, 2002, the NCAA rejected Alabama's appeal to reduce the severity of the sanctions. At that time, the NCAA stated they felt that the sanctions were appropriate and that it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> of the cooperation of the University that the death penalty for the football program was not considered. As the appeal was denied, for the 2003 season Alabama saw a smaller recruiting class and was ineligible for both the 2003 SEC Championship Game and bowl games. The latter penalty would end up being meaningless due to the Tide going 4-9.|$|E

He pressed for a position in parliament, suggesting [...] "being in the Admiralty or being paymaster of the pensions." [...] However, this desire <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> he thought that such a position would provide a stepping stone to a higher peerage, and he was made the Earl of Farnham, in the Irish peerage in 1763.
