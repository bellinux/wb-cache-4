5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Typhoon Shanshan, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau issued a marine warning for all {{ships in the}} areas around {{the north and the}} east coasts of the island and in the Bashi Channel. Tourists <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> avoid the areas due to fears over large waves. The Zhejiang provincial government in the People's Republic of China also asked all fishermen to return to port and ordered local authorities to help with evacuations of people from areas threatened by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{take a more active}} role in the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which {{was likely to be}} flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to physical jobs, women <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> cut back and ration. Silk and nylon {{were used for}} the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women actually painted lines down the back of their legs to create the illusion of wearing the fashionable stockings of the time.|$|E
25|$|Kunle Afolayan like in his {{previous}} films featured in October 1 as a farmer with the name Agbekoya. For his role, {{he had to leave}} his hair for sometime in order to let it just grow. He also stated in an interview with Toni Kan and Peju Akande on Africa Magic that some other actors <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> leave their hair and beard for about a year for the film.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican federal {{government}} {{issued a statement}} on 13 May 2012 condemning the attacks. The Secretaría de Gobernación (Segob) offered its support to aid the authorities {{of the state of}} Nuevo León to find those responsible. The municipal authorities of the state <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> maintain coordination and work in unison with the Federal government. The Mexican authorities then asked the population to stay calm, since the massacre took place in a remote area and {{in the darkness of the}} early morning. In addition, SEGOB emphasised that as for the Monterrey casino attack and the San Fernando massacre, justice would be served.|$|E

All passengers of the flights <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> contact the Health Ministry or head to any hospital, clinic or health office or further action, and crew members of MH091 and AK5358 were located and grounded. As the first patient has indicated, the use of thermal scanners is revealed not to be entirely effective as symptoms of his flu had yet to manifest; the Health Ministry resumes the use of the scanners nevertheless.|$|E
25|$|British {{forces in}} the Middle East were ordered to avoid provocation. Following the defeat of Poland, the threat of an Axis attack from the Balkans against British {{positions}} in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean region increased. In late 1939, {{with the assumption that}} Britain would soon be at war with Italy, planning began for attacks to capture Bardia and Jaghbub (Giarabub) in Libya and arrangements began in Egypt, to accommodate a much larger force. Preparations to reinforce the Iraqi army were made and Palestinian security forces were to be reduced to the minimum. British forces in East Africa were to study operations to destroy the Italian forces and support local risings, all in support of the main Allied offensive, which was planned to be launched from French Somaliland. Troops in Sudan <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> consider launching operations against Kufra in southern Libya.|$|E

500|$|In the Monterey Bay Area Council, Bánáthy {{implemented}} a unique approach to training both the adults and the boys. During 1967, he recruited {{a select group}} of young men and their leaders from troops in the Monterey Bay Area. The individuals were chosen to pilot-test teaching both adult leaders and their Scouts in sequence. In an application not since reproduced, all Wood Badge attendees <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> bring their troop to a single week of White Stag summer camp [...] in August.|$|E
500|$|Pilots <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} the new [...] "Blind Flying Certificate 3", which was especially introduced {{for this new}} type of operation. Pilots were trained at night, over unfamiliar terrain, and forced to rely on their instruments for direction.

To help the pilot see his instrument panel, a violet light was installed.|$|E

Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills. The album has an overall R vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.|$|E

500|$|Also, {{while in}} Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith further by {{addressing}} tablets to the kings and {{rulers of the}} world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward the betterment {{of the world and}} its peoples. His first letter was sent to Sultan Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed by the Tablet of the Kings which was a general address to all rulers. In that latter letter the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Bahá'u'lláh's call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the reins of government that they should rule with justice and protect the rights of the downtrodden. He also told the rulers to reduce their armaments and reconcile their differences. The Christian monarchs <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised [...] "Spirit of Truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Users have {{reported}} that mephedrone causes euphoria, stimulation, an enhanced appreciation for music, an elevated mood, decreased hostility, improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation; these effects {{are similar to the}} effects of cocaine, amphetamines and MDMA, and last different amounts of time depending on the way the drug is taken. Of 70 Dutch users of mephedrone, 58 described it as an overall pleasant experience and 12 described it as an unpleasant experience. In a survey of UK users who had previously taken cocaine, most users found it produced a better-quality and longer-lasting high and was less addictive. The users <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> compare the [...] "risk", and they answered that it was equal. A study of users in Northern Ireland found they did not equate the fact that mephedrone was legal with it being safe to use. This was contrary to another study in New Zealand, where users of benzylpiperazine thought that because it was legal, it was safe.|$|E
500|$|Tremaine {{was able}} to acquire some {{worthwhile}} material, and the magazine showed improvement over its five issues. [...] Among the better-known stories Tremaine obtained was [...] "Vortex Blaster", by E.E. Smith; {{this was the first}} in a series about Storm Cloud, later collected in book form.

500|$|In early 2002, Portland Aerial Transportation, Inc. (PATI) {{was formed}} as a {{non-profit}} board. One of its first public actions was to request the Portland Bureau of Transportation (at the time known as the Portland Office of Transportation, and abbreviated as PDOTsic) to undertake an independent analysis of the connectivity options considered earlier by the university and its development supporters. In May 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's process proposal and also accepted PATI as the project sponsor. PDOT's assessment led {{to the same conclusion}} OHSU had reached earlier: an aerial tram was the preferred approach. PDOT also recommended a second tram linking the Marquam Hill area with a nearby transit center on SW Barbur Boulevard. [...] In July 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's recommendations and asked PDOT and PATI to proceed to the design phase, including a design competition. Both <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> work with residents of the affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate the tram's impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany the project. One of the results of that process was the Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which was completed mid-2012.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Westinghouse Broadcasting, a {{division}} of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, devised a new format of local news called [...] "Eyewitness News".
