50|$|Sheet-fed presses offer several advantages. Because {{individual}} {{sheets are}} fed through, {{a large number}} of sheet sizes and format sizes can be run through the same press. In addition, <b>waste</b> <b>sheets</b> can be used for make-ready (which is the testing process to ensure a quality print run). This allows for lower cost preparation so that good paper is not wasted while setting up the press, for plates and inks. <b>Waste</b> <b>sheets</b> do bring some disadvantages as often there are dust and offset powder particles that transfer on to the blankets and plate cylinders, creating imperfections on the printed sheet. This method produces the highest quality images.|$|R

Littlewood was looking for a young Welshman to play Shakespeare's Owen Glendower, and Taffy in Ewan MacColl's Paradise Street.

5000|$|Nag Hammadi {{bindings}} {{were constructed}} with a textblock of papyrus sheets, assembled {{into a single}} section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets. Because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, {{and it is likely}} that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound. [...] Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with <b>waste</b> <b>sheets</b> of papyrus. The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement. These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers. [...] A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed. Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.|$|R

5000|$|Treatment Waste: Treatment waste {{consists}} of sludge, byproducts, coproducts, or metal scraps {{resulting from a}} facility or plant. Sludge is any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. This includes electric arc furnace dust and baghouse dusts. A byproduct is a material {{that is not a}} primary product which is not solely or separately produced in a production process whereas coproducts are intentionally produced. Byproducts need further processing to be useful whereas coproducts are highly processed and can be sold as a commodity without further processing. Examples of byproducts include slag, fly ash, heavy ends, distillation column bottoms, etc. and coproducts include metals such as lead produced during the copper refining process. Scrap metal <b>wastes</b> include <b>sheet</b> metal, wire, metal tanks and containers, scrap automobiles, and machine shop turnings that are generally nonhazardous in nature.|$|R

The facility has the equipment and systems to re-manufacture almost all components of the aircraft operated by the company. 1. Every five years the paint coating on a jet is stripped and replaced. The stripping operation uses methylene chloride-based stripper and generates stripper waste and wastewater containing residual stripper.

40|$|A large {{proportional}} of {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs) are released into the environment from various industrial processes. The current study elucidates an application of a simple adsorption phenomenon for removal of three main types of VOCs, i. e., benzene, xylene and toluene, from an air stream. Two kinds of adsorbents namely acid digested adsorbent and activated carbon are prepared to assess the removal efficiency of each adsorbent in the indoor workplace environment. The results illustrate that the adsorbents prepared from corrugated sheets were remarkably effective {{for the removal of}} each pollutant type. Nevertheless, activated carbon showed high potential of adsorbing the targeted VOC compared to the acid digested adsorbent. The uptake by the adsorbents was in the following order: benzene > xylene > toluene. Moreover, maximum adsorption of benzene, toluene and xylene occurred at 20 °C and 1. 5 cm/s for both adsorbents whereas minimum success was attained at 30 °C and 1. 0 cm/s. However, adsorption pattern are found to be similar for each of the the three aromatic hydrocarbons.

30|$|A handbag design {{slated for}} re-birth can follow a similar {{collaboration}} {{process and the}} entire life cycle of the product is vital in both instances (Lee and DeLong 2016 c, 2018). However, there are some important differences from the apparel previously slated for re-birth. For example, the materials of the fashion handbag are harder to redesign {{because they are more}} rigid in structure and sometimes less resilient and thus more difficult to reuse. Fashion handbags going through re-birth design are one type of bag used for upcycling.

40|$|Metals {{of concern}} {{due to their}} toxic {{characteristics}} are arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium and silver. These are often found in corrosive liquids such as acids. Possible ways of reducing or eliminating these metals include: 1. Review all procedures for elimination or reduction of quantities of metals used. The use of microscale equipment or increased instrumentation can reduce the quantities of waste generated. 2. Teaching labs can substitute less hazardous metals for those experiments involving heavy metals. Or a laboratory which brings the raw material {{through a series of}} steps to the product and then back to the raw material again can eliminate disposal of that metal. 3. Metals used as catalysts can be eliminated by simply allowing more time for the reaction to come to completion. 4. Precious and semiprecious metals can be precipitated out of solution. For instance, the reclamation of silver from photographic solutions is a very common practice. 5.
