It was thought to use too much negative energy until Harold Sonny <b>White</b> <b>said</b> that the amount of energy required could be reduced if the warp bubble were changed into a warp ring.|$|E

His avoidance of violent themes is as strong in his non-medical stories as in the Sector General series.|$|E
