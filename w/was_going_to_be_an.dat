Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident that this is going to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that this <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important book and one that readers were really going to respond to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack.

500|$|Takumi {{found the}} game's first defendant, Larry Butz, to be {{particularly}} difficult to write, and had to re-write him several times. Originally, Larry <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> [...] "average Joe" [...] type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode, but after his inclusion in the first episode, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character [...] "some oomph". Following this, Takumi wrote him as a [...] "prickly tough-guy" [...] who had the habit of telling people {{he was going to}} kill them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did not like this, so Takumi changed him into a character who laments his lot in life, saying [...] "I'm going to die!" [...] or that the situation is killing him. The culprit of the third episode was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all villains in the game were male. The development team debated over what to do with the now female character; some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character into a director, and made the culprit a [...] "strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed" [...] producer.|$|E
500|$|During development, {{the team}} decided to cater for the core Japanese RPG fanbase, {{as they did}} not believe the game viable for Western release at the time. At the early stages of development, Bravely Default <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> action {{role-playing}} game, a genre Silicon Studios had previously worked on with 3D Dot Game Heroes. After developing a prototype build and putting it before Asano, it was decided to make the battle system a traditional turn-based model. The interdependent [...] "Bravely" [...] and [...] "Default" [...] systems underwent changes during the development process. Initially, Asano envisioned a system similar to the Tension stat used in multiple Dragon Quest games, but designer Kensuke Nakahara wanted something more exciting for players. He was also annoyed that the majority of bosses in both Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy got two or more actions per turn while player characters only got one each. After some consideration, Nakahara decided on a system where characters could bank points by not taking actions during a turn for later use, or create loan points to act multiple times in a current turn. The concept of the Notebook of D, which would offer players deeper insights into the world of Bravely Default, was inspired by a similar system from Higurashi When They Cry. During the late stages of the game's development, the team had to make several last-minute tweaks and changes to ensure the game delivered the best possible performance. Due to the game's chosen mechanics, balancing the game became a major part of later development.|$|E

500|$|Terence Stamp's {{name was}} {{deliberately}} {{kept out of}} the opening credits {{in order to keep the}} secret he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films, starring Christopher Reeve. Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology, so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan's heart condition to Jor-El, where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor-El to be given the power to bring Clark back. This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan's heart. The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor-El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed to be talking to Jonathan in season three's [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El's voice, rippling as he spoke. To save money on this effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. At the time of season three's [...] "Memoria", where a scene depicting Jor-El and Lara placing baby Kal-El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> origin story, and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor-El. Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb. In one of Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship. In season nine, the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance, and Julian Sands was cast for the role.|$|E
