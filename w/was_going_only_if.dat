50|$|Simply, {{if one is}} on the {{top floor}} of a building, all {{elevators}} will come from below (none can come from above), and then depart going down, while if one is on the second from top floor, an elevator going to the top floor will pass first on the way up, and then shortly afterward on the way down - thus, while an equal number will pass going up as going down, downwards elevators will generally shortly follow upwards elevators (unless the elevator idles {{on the top floor}}), and thus the first elevator observed will usually <b>be</b> <b>going</b> up. The first elevator observed will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> down <b>only</b> <b>if</b> one begins observing in the short interval after an elevator has passed going up, while the rest of the time the first elevator observed will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} get very wet! Let us make a compromise! You may come with me. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>only</b> a very little distance, {{and then you can}} take the cab on to your home, or {{wherever}} you want to go to." ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{boats were}} lying moored to the wharves {{at the side}} of the canal. One was a long, sharp, and narrow steamer, which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through the whole length of the canal to the Helder. The other was a trekschuyt, or canal boat, which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>only</b> a short way, to the nearest village.|$|R
50|$|We have no {{ultimate}} ends. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>only</b> {{from day}} to day. We are fighting only for immediate objects - objects that can be realized in a few years... we say in our constitution that we are opposed to theorists... we are all practical men...|$|R
50|$|Starting October 30, 2015, {{the station}} {{notified}} its listeners via Facebook that it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> online <b>only.</b> The station handed out CDs to its listeners after <b>going</b> digital <b>only.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was reacquired by Washington {{after the}} 1948 season, but <b>was</b> ineffective, <b>going</b> <b>only</b> 10-21 in 112 games {{in his second}} stint with the Senators.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Vaughan, 'got {{it somewhere}} on me. Haynes, Jarvis, and myself <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in. <b>Only,</b> the Mutual has to stick up the list.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, skating. We would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> back, <b>only</b> Holt broke {{one of his}} skates {{and that}} delayed us. Been out hunting, eh? Any luck?” ...|$|R
5000|$|In the movie, when Semyon, Tiger Cub and Bear go to help Anton {{with the}} vampires in their yellow truck, they nearly run over Zabulon. The latter throws the truck over him, then {{it hits the}} road and keeps going. In the book, Semyon says he saw {{the same thing in}} his dream, but doesn't {{remember}} who was with him or where he <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> <b>only</b> that they <b>were</b> in [...] "some old van".|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked to}} {{elucidate}} {{on the nature}} of Ana's suffering, the director, Carlos Saura replied :" [...] Cría Cuervos is a sad film, yes. But that's part of my belief that childhood {{is one of the most}} terrible parts in the life of a human being. What I'm trying to say is that at that age you've no idea where it <b>is</b> you <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> <b>only</b> that people <b>are</b> taking you somewhere, leading you, pulling you and you are frightened. You don't know where you're going or who you are or what you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do. It's a time of terrible indecision." ...|$|R

60|$|How was she to {{bear the}} change?--It was true that her friend <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>only</b> {{half a mile from}} them; but Emma was aware that great must be the {{difference}} between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has only}} been here a month or two, it seems, and cannot stay much longer, because she finds it so lonely and damp in winter. She <b>is</b> <b>going</b> abroad. <b>Only</b> think, she would like {{me to go with}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|The night {{came down}} swiftly, {{for a great}} stormcloud, in which jagged {{lightning}} played, blotted out the last rays of the sunk sun. Then, with rolling thunder and torrents of rain, the tempest burst over the sinking ship. The mariners {{could no longer see}} to steer, they knew not whither they <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> <b>only</b> the lessened seas told them that they had entered the harbour mouth. Presently the San Antonio struck upon a rock, and the shock of it threw Castell, who was bending over the senseless shape of Margaret, against the bulwarks and dazed him.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. I <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to {{say that}} I didn't know that you and Craven were acquainted.|$|R
60|$|GINGER All right, I <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{to throw}} the slops out of window. There ain't no basin.|$|R

6000|$|Fanny roused herself, and {{replying}} only in part, said, [...] "But you <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{from one}} set of friends to another. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to a very particular friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, our time's precious," [...] {{said the}} coachman, haughtily. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to some trumpery little village or {{other in the}} neighborhood, while we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{straight}} to Italy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is excellent--really excellent," [...] Julien proclaimed. [...] "Do {{you mean}} to say seriously that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to pay <b>only</b> two francs each for this repast?" ...|$|R
30|$|Proof In {{this case}} we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to prove <b>only</b> {{statement}} (iv), the other proofs are analogous, adding the corresponding term (in {{the case when}} it is necessary).|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{somewhere to}} supper. I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to call for}} Eva Fanesborough, and I suppose we should have had some bridge afterwards. Come in instead, Lawrence. I can {{telephone}} to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> to contradict, Ma," [...] {{returned}} Caddy. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to {{say that}} surely you wouldn't have me be a mere drudge all my life." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you notice}} the {{direction}} of his bill as it enters the water, you can tell fairly well about where he will come up again. It was confusing at first, in chasing him, to find that he rarely came up where he was expected. I would paddle hard in the direction he <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> <b>only</b> to find him far to the right or left, or behind me, when at last he showed himself. That was because I followed his body, not his bill. Moving in one direction, he will turn his head and dive. That is to mislead you, if you are following him. Follow his bill, as he does himself, and you will be near him when he rises; for he rarely turns under water.|$|R
6000|$|... "There won't be {{much trouble}} about this," [...] {{answered}} Fred. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to give Nappy Martell {{something to think}} about." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} stand-alone CELT {{has been}} merged into Opus.Therefore, CELT as stand-alone format is now abandoned and obsolete. Development <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on <b>only</b> for its hybridised form as {{a layer of}} Opus, integrated with SILK.This article covers the historic, stand-alone format, for the integrated form and its evolution since the integration into Opus see the article on Opus.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty smiled, almost sadly. [...] "Of course!" [...] she said, [...] "but no bright day can {{be quite}} the same as this {{moonlight}} to me. It shone down on us when I rode {{out into the night}} and darkness without knowing where I <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> and <b>only</b> that you were beside me. You will stay there always now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom's last words, {{as he drew}} {{up under}} the lime-trees before the door, were, 'Mind, I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> about the 'Diseases of Climate'.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Institutional flexibility: The SSRC was {{designed}} to be as elastic as possible, to take advantage of changing social conditions and methods of investigation. Even in its early days, the Council’s research planning committees were expected to carry out their work for a limited span of time, and for the same reason fellowship programs <b>were</b> kept <b>going</b> <b>only</b> {{as long as they were}} judged to be effective.|$|R
50|$|When numerically solving an {{equation}} manually, by calculator, {{or when a}} computer program run has to solve equations {{so many times that}} the speed of convergence becomes important, then it could be preferable to first try a usually-faster method, <b>going</b> to Bisection <b>only</b> <b>if</b> the faster method fails to converge, or fails to converge at a useful rate.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{wrote and}} asked if I might see you alone, because I had {{something}} that I {{wanted to say to}} you. I've wanted to say it ever since we were at Court Leys together, but I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away--heaven <b>only</b> knows when I shall come back, and perhaps something may happen to me--and I thought it was unfair to you to speak.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I then said, 'Well, we <b>are</b> not <b>only</b> <b>going</b> {{to demand}} for the {{position}} of a commissioner, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to take away his seat'. And I decided that I would contest the governor's seat in the next election".|$|R
