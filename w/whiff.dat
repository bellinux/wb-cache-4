5|$|Nova {{worked in}} 2011 {{to develop his}} slider, {{changing}} his grip {{at the suggestion of}} Yankees executive Billy Connors. The work paid off, as his slider garnered a <b>whiff</b> rate of 43% in 2011. Nova's changeup is not his main weapon and is not used against right-handed hitters.|$|E
5|$|Fister throws four pitches, and {{is mainly}} a groundball pitcher. His two seam fastball is thrown at 88–91mph. His other pitches are a cutter (85–87), a curveball (73–79), and a changeup (80–84). The curveball is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a career <b>whiff</b> rate of over 30%. Fister walks few batters; he {{finished}} {{third and fourth}} in 2010 and 2011, respectively, in lowest walks per nine innings ratio.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy {{struggles with}} a promise that he made to his girlfriend Avery Jessup—he will not drink alcohol during her entire {{pregnancy}} {{in a show of}} solidarity with her. Instead, he takes up knitting and stage magic, but finds the urge to drink so strong that he begins sniffing paint cans and Jenna's breath just to get a <b>whiff</b> of alcohol. During TGS, Liz gets a phone call from her boyfriend airline pilot Carol informing her that he is going through extreme turbulence and may crash his plane.|$|E

5|$|Nathan {{throws a}} mix of four pitches. His main pitch, a four-seam fastball was once thrown in the mid-to-upper 90s, but now settles between 91 and 94mph. His main {{breaking}} ball is a hard slider in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He uses the slider less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s. He also uses a two-seam fastball against lefties. His slider is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a <b>whiff</b> rate of 42% since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{has a high}} strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings {{through his}} first 251⅓ MLB innings. This {{corresponds}} with high swing-and-miss rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup—the highest <b>whiff</b> rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began tracking pitches. Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if he had enough innings to qualify. Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and in fact is a hindrance to maintaining low pitch counts.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, racing {{under his}} {{name for the}} first time, started the 1818 season much earlier than he had done the {{previous}} two seasons, with his first race coming on 18 May at the York Spring Meeting in a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each over two miles. He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's Rasping, who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from Rasping, with Hornby in third and <b>Whiff</b> last of the four runners.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she caught a <b>whiff</b> of her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At {{the end of the}} day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a <b>whiff</b> of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1982 season, both Ryan and Steve Carlton were {{approaching}} Walter Johnson's all-time strikeout record, sometimes passing one another's career totals in successive starts. On April 27, 1983, Ryan won the race with his 3,509th <b>whiff,</b> against Brad Mills of the Montreal Expos (Steve Carlton would reach the same mark two weeks after Ryan).|$|E
60|$|We passed hot streams boiling in the forest; saw <b>whiffs</b> {{of steam}} beyond these, and yet other <b>whiffs</b> {{breaking}} through the misty green hills in the far distance; we trampled on sulphur in crystals, and sniffed things much worse than any sulphur which is known to the upper world; and so journeying, bewildered with the novelty, came upon a really park-like place where Tom suggested we should get out and play with the geysers on foot.|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of clue cells on wet mount. Similar to the <b>whiff</b> test, {{the test for}} clue cells is performed by placing a drop of sodium chloride solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give {{a clue to the}} reason behind the discharge. These are epithelial cells that are coated with bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Burnett threw four pitches. His main pitches were a four-seam fastball and sinker at 91–94mph, {{as well as}} a knuckle curveball at 80–83. Less frequently, he also threw a changeup to left-handed hitters at 87–89mph. The {{curve is}} {{especially}} good for swinging strikes with its 44% <b>whiff</b> rate for Burnett's career. The changeup has also been good for getting groundouts — it has a ground ball/fly ball ratio of better than 5:1.|$|E
25|$|The North Vietnamese also netted their SA-2 Fan Song fire-control radars {{with their}} Bar Lock, <b>Whiff,</b> and Spoon Rest ground control {{intercept}} (GCI) radars. The GCI radars could feed the tracking data to Fan Song, which then {{did not have}} to be turned on until after missile launch. The Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) gear carried by the American aircraft provided warning when the aircraft were being tracked by the Fan Song, but could not detect emissions from the GCI radar. Thus pilots had little or no warning of a missile attack.|$|E

25|$|Buchholz {{throws a}} four-seam fastball (90–94mph) topping out at 96 and has reached 99 in the past, a two-seam fastball (89–93), a cutter (87–91), a curveball (75–79), and a {{straight}} changeup (78–81). Since 2010, {{he has not}} thrown a slider (78–81). In 2012, he threw a handful of splitters to left-handed hitters, but the pitch was thrown just 2% {{of the time the}} whole season. His most commonly thrown pitch when ahead in the count is his 11–5 curveball. His repertoire does not vary greatly between left-handers and right-handers. Buchholz has never compiled large strikeout totals, but his changeup does have a high <b>whiff</b> rate of 45%.|$|E
25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a <b>whiff,</b> he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E

On April 13, she passed Nicole Myers to take third place; on April 16, she struck out 13 in a 3–2 win over the University of Missouri to become the third member of the 1,400 Strikeout Club (along with Michele Granger and Courtney Blades). Later she would again <b>whiff</b> 24 to match her own school record vs. the Texas Tech Red Raiders and along with Erin Crawford {{combined}} for another 31 strikeouts on April 26. On May 12, she crested the 1,500 strikeout plateau; on June 3, she broke the 1,600 strikeout mark.|$|E
