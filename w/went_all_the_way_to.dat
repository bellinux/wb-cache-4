5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing {{that it would}} put both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} year in Delta State, Harris helped the Lady Statesmen to a 16–2 record. However, they {{finished}} third in the regional tournament and failed to qualify to the national tournament. The following year, the Lady Statesmen qualified to the national tournament at Harrisonburg, Virginia. They <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the final where they met the Mighty Macs of Immaculata University who had won the last three consecutive AIAW championships. In the final, Harris scored 32 points and recorded 16 rebounds to lead Delta State past Immaculata 90–81. The 1975 championship game was televised nationally (albeit delayed). This is the first year that women's basketball games were nationally televised by a major network. That season, Delta State went undefeated in with a 28–0 record, the only undefeated college season that year (men or women). Harris scored a total of 138 points and 63 rebounds in four games at the national tournament and was named as the tournament's most valuable player.|$|E

In April, she played her first ever Fed Cup singles match where she faced Israeli Shahar Pe'er, which she won in three sets.

25|$|In the 1850s, biographer Delbanco writes, {{the revolt}} on a slave ship {{was not a}} far-fetched topic for a {{literary}} work. In 1839, the Spanish schooner La Amistad with fifty slaves became the site of slave revolt between two Cuban ports, and two crew members were killed. An American naval vessel seized the Amistad when the ship had wandered off course near Long Island. Then followed a legal battle which <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Supreme Court, where John Quincy Adams succeeded in setting the slaves free in the 1841 U.S. Supreme Court ruling United States v. The Amistad. In 1841 the American Creole moved slaves from Virginia to New Orleans when nineteen slaves killed a white sailor and took command of the ship, which then set sail to the British Bahamas. In the Creole case, the slaves were set free under the 1833 British Act of Emancipation. Madison Washington, {{the leader of the}} revolt, became the hero of a novel a decade later, in March 1853, when Frederick Douglass published the short novel The Heroic Slave in his anti-slavery newspaper North Star.|$|E
25|$|In December 1999 to January 2000, McManaman and the Madrid team {{took part}} in the {{controversial}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, where McManaman missed an injury time chance to win the game, and then the penalty kick against Necaxa that would have sent Madrid into third place. McManaman and the team then returned to Spain and established themselves as the side that <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the 2000 Champions League final under new coach Vicente del Bosque, who had replaced John Toshack in November. McManaman's form in the buildup saw him receive several man of the match awards, forming a strong midfield partnership with Fernando Redondo, as Madrid beat holders Manchester United and Bayern Munich to reach the final. It was at this Champions League final (played at the Stade de France, Paris) that McManaman experienced his finest hour as a player, scoring a spectacular volley in a 3–0 victory over Valencia. His performance on this greatest of club football stages saw him hailed the man of the match by the English press, a view endorsed by his Madrid teammate Iván Helguera. His part in Madrid's eighth European Cup win saw him become the first English player ever to win Europe's premier club competition with a foreign club.|$|E

25|$|The team {{played in}} the Main League for the 1960–61 season, where it {{finished}} third in the Conference B. However, it was the cup which would make 1960 Rosenborg's break-through season. The previous season, the team had reached the round of 16, but in 1960 the team <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the final, where it in the first match tied 3–3 against Odd, and in the second game won 3–2, with both games going into extra time, making Rosenborg Norwegian football champions. Five of Rosenborg's goals were scored by Eldar Hansen. In the 1961–62, Rosenborg entered the Marathon League, a 16-team, 30-game league which would last from the spring of 1961 to the fall of 1962, and allow the two conferences of the Main League to be merged into a single, top league—the ten-team First Division. John Krogh made his debut for Rosenborg that season, and also became the club's first player to play for the Norway national football team during 1962. The season also saw Rosenborg's first international friendly, losing 1–3 against Scotland's Dunfermline and 3–0 away. Rosenborg finished on ninth place, and missed the goal of reaching the First Division by two points and a single place.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} defend their Philippine Cup crown, they signed Alex Crisano to {{supplement}} their front court and Rahshon Turner as their import for the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference. Despite a different look, the Kings had a slow start losing their first five games with both Turner and Ernest Brown. To stop the losing streak, they replaced Brown with another recruit from the NBA Development League, Chris Alexander whose inside scoring and rebounding helped the Kings win 10 of their next 13 games in the eliminations. The Kings ended on a high note ending the eliminations 10–8 with an outright quarterfinals berth. They faced Sta. Lucia in the quarterfinals and completed a 2-game sweep en route to another showdown against Red Bull. In the semis, which everyone predicted to be a 7-game showdown saw the Kings sweep the Barakos that included a 101–97 overtime victory in Game 4. So convincingly was the sweep that they shamed Red Bull all throughout the series. After the last game of the series, the Barakos <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> their locker room without congratulating Barangay Ginebra. This gave Ginebra its first series sweep in franchise history, and its 17th finals appearance. This also gave Uichico his 12th finals appearance (second with Ginebra) and the third sweep in league history since the 1992 Third Conference when Swift swept 7-Up in the finals. The Game 4 victory extended their winning streak dating back from the eliminations to 12 (the longest in franchise history).|$|E
25|$|Taylor won {{the last}} UK Open Qualifier by {{overcoming}} Ian White 6–2 in the final. He lost 10–6 in the quarter-finals of the UK Open itself. In week seven of the Premier League, Taylor averaged 115.80 against Van Barneveld but was defeated 7–4. It is the eighth highest televised average of all-time and the highest to lose a match. He went into the penultimate round of fixtures needing a victory over Anderson to stand a chance of progressing but, when he lost 7–5, it {{marked the first time}} in the 11-year history of the event that Taylor did not qualify for the play-offs. He did average 102.95 over his 16 matches, second only to Van Gerwen's 105.15. Taylor picked up his second title of the year at the ninth Players Championship with a 6–4 victory over Anderson in the final. He thrashed Anderson 11–3 in the semi-finals of the Dubai Darts Masters, before missing too many doubles from 8–6 ahead of Van Gerwen in the final, to lose 11–8. Taylor and Lewis played in the final of the World Cup against Scotland's Anderson and Peter Wright and it <b>went</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the final singles match in which Lewis beat Wright to win England's third title in the event. Taylor had kicked off the final by beating Wright 4–0 whilst setting the highest individual average in the history of the event at 113.43. He followed that up by holding on from 7–2 ahead of Wright in the final of the inaugural Japan Darts Masters to edge it 8–7.|$|E
