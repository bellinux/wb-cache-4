5|$|Belldandy is {{regarded}} by commentators {{as an example}} of the magical girlfriend character, and comparisons have been drawn with the characters of Samantha from Bewitched and Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie. The character's very conservative nature, however, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> completely subordinates her to her fictional boyfriend, Keiichi, has led to some concerns from critics and has polarized the audience.|$|E

It was the largest of the four new companies created by the SBG in 1985, with an initial fleet of 381 vehicles, of <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> 300 were sourced from the former Alexander (Midland) fleet.|$|E

He was temporarily paralyzed from the neck down and had to use a walker for a year.|$|E
5|$|Northampton Museum {{maintains}} a Concealed Shoe Index, which by 1998 contained more than 1100 reports of concealed shoes, mostly from Britain but some {{from as far}} away as Canada. By 2012 it had increased to 1900 entries, of <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> half date from the 19th century.|$|E

All driver {{candidates}} {{must spend}} 8 months completing 1,326 hours of professional training {{and pass the}} National Certification before they can drive the train. In addition, after becoming a certified high-speed train driver, they undergo further on-the-job training {{at least three times}} each year in order to guarantee they can drive the train safely.|$|E
5|$|The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January, brought {{winds of}} around 90mph (140km/h) <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> {{destroyed}} the telescope. The towers bowed, {{and one of}} the bearings connecting the dish to the towers slipped. After an expensive repair, diagonal bracing girders were added to the towers to prevent this happening again.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterways}} <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> completely {{surround the}} Hampton Roads region {{play an important}} part in the local economy.

5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E

5|$|Banister played {{baseball}} at La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. He developed bone cancer in his sophomore year, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> necessitated the amputation of his leg. While playing college baseball for Lee College, {{he suffered a}} home plate collision that broke three vertebrae in his neck, leaving him paralyzed for ten days. After rehabilitating, he was named a Junior College All-American the next season, and received a scholarship to the University of Houston, {{to play for the}} Houston Cougars baseball team. He was then drafted by the Pirates in 1986. After playing in Minor League Baseball, he appeared in a major league game on July 23, 1991, recording a hit in his only plate appearance. He did not appear in another major league game, and ended his playing career after the 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|Dr. William M. Gray of Colorado State University issued {{forecasts}} on May29 and July28 indicating within both forecasts {{the anticipation}} of a below normal hurricane season. In May, a total of 8named tropical storms were expected, with four hurricane expected, 15days with hurricanes, {{and a total of}} 35days with a tropical storm active in the northern Atlantic Ocean. In July, the numbers were dropped to a total of 7named storms, 4hurricanes, 10hurricane days, and 25days with a named tropical storm, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> perfectly verified.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E

5|$|Field {{attended}} Macquarie University {{to receive}} training {{in early childhood}} education, and founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|GO Bus service {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} routes, many of which stand in for train service when it is not operating and/or which extend the reach of train service to communities beyond their termini. Other GO buses are independent of rail services, such as the Highway 407 series of routes, which provides an orbital-type service that encircles Toronto proper and makes connections between all train lines. There are also routes that serve Pearson International Airport, seasonal destinations such as Canada's Wonderland, and several colleges and universities. The vast majority of GO train stations have connecting GO bus service, of <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> all the exceptions are situated within Toronto proper. There are also 16 bus terminals served by GO buses, many of which provide local transit connections, as well as intermediate stops and ticket agencies.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, <b>which</b> <b>almost</b> succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what {{came to be known as}} Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.|$|E
