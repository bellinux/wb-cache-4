5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Mourning/Black Friday" [...] is a two-piece song, {{which begins}} with an {{instrumental}} section called [...] "Good Mourning". Lyrically, Mustaine has described [...] "Black Friday" [...] as being about [...] "a homicidal madman who goes on a killing spree". With an excessive use of gory language and violent imagery, the song chronicles the acts of a serial killer. It was inspired by Dijon Carruthers, who was briefly the band's drummer prior to the hiring of Gar Samuelson. According to Mustaine, Carruthers <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> with people who were practicing occultism, and they inspired him to write songs based on spiritual themes.|$|E
500|$|The {{track that}} {{underwent}} {{the most extensive}} change was [...] "I Miss You", an old song from the Debut era, {{the result of the}} input of Howie Bernstein (a protégé of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its [...] "Latin-tinged [...] ". Back in London, Björk contacted [...] "old standby" [...] Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on [...] "Enjoy". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk's request. The singer decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called [...] "Travessia". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor [...] "immediately bolstered" [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] and [...] "Isobel". This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave Post the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included: Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: [...] "The people I collaborated with were all people I <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> with in clubs in London. I had known them all for a while before we ended up working together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although The Someloves' Mather was not {{interested}} in touring or even performing live, the other members created Dom Mariani's Orange with the line-up of Mariani, Moon, Italiano and Zupanovich to showcase the album. They also recorded a track, [...] "Christ-masonic", for a various artists' compilation, Rockin' Bethlehem: The Second Coming (1990). In 1998 Mariani described how Orange developed, [...] "The Someloves was a loose studio idea ... I <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> to play live again but Darryl wasn't into it ... the record company were also putting the pressure on us to go on the road ... The album had been well received, so it was a real shame we couldn't go on with it. So it became Orange". Orange performed The Someloves' and some new material but by mid-1991 Orange had also disbanded. In 2006, Half A Cow records issued [...] "Don't Talk About Us: The Real Pop Recordings of the Someloves 1985-89" [...] which collected together every official recording The Someloves made.|$|E

He stood as still as if he had suddenly been frozen stiff. His sharp black ears were cocked forward, and his head was turned just a little to one side. Reddy was listening. He was listening for the voice of Blacky. You see, he thought Blacky was still far ahead of him.|$|E
60|$|When {{the landing}} was made, {{all the men}} were {{successfully}} protected from over-eating except the 'Portyghee;' he escaped the watch and ate an incredible number of bananas: a hundred and fifty-two, the third mate said, but this was undoubtedly an exaggeration; I {{think it was a}} hundred and fifty-one. He was already nearly half full of leather; it <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> of his ears. (I do not state this on the third mate's authority, for we have seen what sort of a person he was; I state it on my own.) The 'Portyghee' ought to have died, of course, and even now it seems a pity that he didn't; but he got well, and as early as any of them; and all full of leather, too, the way he was, and butter-timber and handkerchiefs and bananas. Some of the men did eat handkerchiefs in those last days, also socks; {{and he was one of}} them.|$|E
60|$|Ten minutes {{afterwards}} I {{went downstairs}} {{to see how the}} preparations were progressing. Fresh muslin curtains had been put up in the room.

An antimacassar lying carelessly on the seat of a chair concealed a rent in the horse-hair, and the china ornaments on the mantelpiece were so placed that they looked whole. Leeby's black merino was hanging near the window in a good light, and Jess's Sabbath bonnet, which was never worn, occupied a nail beside it. The tea-things stood on a tray in the kitchen bed, whence they could be quickly brought into the room, just as if they were always ready to be used daily. Leeby, as yet in deshabille, was shaving her father at a tremendous rate, and Jess, looking as fresh as a daisy, was ready to receive the visitors. She was peering through the tiny window-blind looking for them.|$|E
