50|$|Merely {{advancing}} the drill by rotary action (and washing) causes a core to be extracted inside the barrel as shown. However, {{at a depth}} of perhaps 300 m, there must be a way to retrieve the core and take it to the surface. Constantly withdrawing the entire heavy drill pipe is impractical, so methods were developed to pull up the core inside the barrel. If the rock would always be solid granite, and the core would always break at the drill bit, then it would be a simple matter to stop the drilling, and lower a simple grabbing device by a wire and pull up the core. Unfortunately, many applications require an undisturbed core in fractured rock, which calls for elaborate <b>wire-line</b> devices.|$|E
50|$|A major {{expense of}} <b>wire-line</b> {{telephone}} service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals {{on a single}} pair of wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|E

50|$|The OPM {{technology}} {{is based on}} the cognitive networking principles that are advanced from traditional wireless networking by the opportunistic utilization of both spectrum bandwidth and mesh station/radio availability. Traditional wireless networking assumes that those resources can be predetermined, and the protocol stacks from <b>wire-line</b> networks can be re-used. For example, in the traditional stack, the MAC (Media Access Control) layer allocates spectrum resources to wireless links; and the network layer sets up a network routing path from source to destination based on the overall network topology. In large-scale wireless systems, the use of this stack results in a network that is unable to respond to volatile spectrum availability which can be typical in unlicensed bands where interference prevails. In addition, random station/radio availability is also often encountered due to the dynamic traffic load (congestion) and other factors such as radio failure. Bottlenecks along both wireless links and stations are created because the packet forwarding protocol cannot respond quickly to these changes.|$|E
50|$|TISPAN NGN Release 1 was {{published}} in December 2005 and contained the architectural foundations and basic specifications required in support of PSTN replacement. The TISPAN NGN architecture is based on sharing common components between cooperating subsystems. The TISPAN NGN architecture complies with the general reference model for next generation networks defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.2011 1 and is therefore layered with a service stratum and a transport stratum. Each of these layers is further decomposed into sub-systems that perform specific roles within the overall architecture. This allows new subsystems to be added over time to cover new demands and service classes. By making network resources, applications, and user equipment common to all subsystems, it ensures mobility of users, terminals and services as much as possible, even across administrative boundaries. A key subsystem {{is based on the}} architectures of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

5000|$|Account {{stacking}} is {{a broadcast}} industry term, {{which refers to}} the deployment of subscription Direct To Home (DTH) satellite receiving equipment at multiple geographical locations under a single customer account. It {{is often referred to}} as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting. Account stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV hacking and piracy but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect. A contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like cable-TV, and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis. ----CRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations In Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the CRTC as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations. 1. Under the regulations a [...] "customer" [...] means a person who is liable for payment for programming services that are distributed by a licensee and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. [...] 2. A [...] "subscriber" [...] is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee. 3. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit <b>wire-line</b> service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for distribution cover a continent-wide area.|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{research}} {{and design of}} Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigms where mainly focused on improving {{the performance of the}} interconnection networks. With emerging wide range of low-power applications and energy constrained high-performance applications, it is highly desirable to have NoCs that are highly energy efficient without incurring performance penalty. In the design of high-performance massive multi-core chips, power and heat have become dominant constrains. Increased power consumption can raise chip temperature, which in turn can decrease chip reliability and performance and increase cooling costs. It was proven that Small-world Wireless Network-on-Chip (SWNoC) architecture which replaces multi-hop <b>wire-line</b> path in a NoC by high-bandwidth single hop long range wireless links, reduces the overall energy dissipation when compared to <b>wire-line</b> mesh-based NoC architecture. However, the overall energy dissipation of the wireless NoC is still dominated by <b>wire-line</b> links and switches (buffers). Dynamic Voltage Scaling is an efficient technique for significant power savings in microprocessors. It has been proposed and deployed in modern microprocessors by exploiting the variance in processor utilization. On a Network-on-Chip paradigm, {{it is more likely that}} the <b>wire-line</b> links and buffers are not always fully utilized even for different applications. Hence, by exploiting these characteristics of the links and buffers over different traffic, DVFS technique can be incorporated on these switches and <b>wire-line</b> links for huge power savings. In this thesis, a history based DVFS mechanism is proposed. This mechanism uses the past utilization of the <b>wire-line</b> links 2 ̆ 6 buffers to predict the future traffic and accordingly tune the voltage and frequency for the links and buffers dynamically for each time window.
