5|$|Copenhagen has a {{significant}} jazz scene that has existed for many years.

Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as cafés and concert halls fill up <b>with</b> <b>big</b> and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.|$|E
5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>Big</b> Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games {{did most of the}} work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{successive}} championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined {{as their}} side aged. Some {{of the players}} had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott {{had been in the}} side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, <b>with</b> <b>big</b> victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{was born}} in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or {{possibly}} 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald {{was the youngest of}} King Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel <b>with</b> <b>big</b> ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} festival, the Experience were booked {{for a series}} of five concerts at Bill Graham's Fillmore, <b>with</b> <b>Big</b> Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience {{outperformed}} Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights, and replaced them {{at the top of the}} bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood studio <b>with</b> <b>big</b> ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
