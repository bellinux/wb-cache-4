5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E

They included letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year before his death, and showed the extent of the damage the CIA drone program had done to Al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|James Temple (1606–1680) was a puritan and English Civil War soldier <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of the {{regicide}} of Charles I. Born in Rochester, Kent, to a well-connected gentry family, he was {{the second}} of two sons of Sir Alexander Temple, although his elder brother died in 1627. As a child, Temple moved with his father from Rochester to Chadwell St Mary in Essex and then to Etchingham in Sussex, where he settled.|$|E
5|$|Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory {{superintendent}} <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> in 1913 of {{the murder}} of a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, and lynching two years later, attracted national attention and became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued {{the trials of}} military personnel involved in the Dirty War, started by her husband. There {{have been more than}} 500 people sentenced, and 1,000 convicted, in a process that was unprecedented in Latin America. De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> and given a life sentence in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new life sentence in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist guerrillas in the northern Argentine provinces, received a life sentence as well.|$|E
5|$|Willson further alienated the {{legislature}} by issuing pardons for several individuals convicted of {{complicity in the}} assassination of Governor William Goebel (1900). These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> for complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan. Goebel's likeness was also removed from state checks and documents {{and was replaced by}} likenesses of either Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, or John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes.

The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> {{of a double}} murder in 1990 {{and sentenced to death}} by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E

Hezbollah also collaborated with the Lebanese government in 2006 to detect Adeeb al-Alam, a former colonel, as an Israeli spy. Also, the organization recruited IDF Lieutenant Colonel Omar al-Heib, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> in 2006 of conducting surveillance for Hezbollah. In 2009, Hezbollah apprehended Marwan Faqih, a garage owner who installed tracking devices in Hezbollah-owned vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{commenced}} {{legal proceedings}} against captured Nazis, establishing the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945. The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent {{figures such as}} Göring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. The former commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the ACLU {{opened up}} a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, {{dedicated}} to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan, Jr., the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, when the Georgia congress refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).|$|E

Kemmler {{was the first person}} in the world known to be executed in an electric chair. Except for four individuals, all of the people executed during this period <b>were</b> <b>convicted</b> of murder. The four exceptions were Joseph Sacoda and Demetrius Gula, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>convicted</b> of kidnapping and executed January 11, 1940, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>convicted</b> of espionage and executed June 19, 1953.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as president, he was affectionately {{known as the}} People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest {{decision}} he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament {{and was sentenced to}} death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.|$|E
