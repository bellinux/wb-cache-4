When Barsness was a hockey player in high school, his team reached the state championships, but his father never {{attended}} a game. His father's absence nurtured a boyhood dream of a place where families could eat and have fun together. This {{was the type of}} place Barsness <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have spent time with his father.|$|E
25|$|He {{first thought}} of {{studying}} medicine while at The Leys School, {{a boarding school}} in Cambridge, when he fractured his clavicle and recorded in his diary that he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1914 but, {{with the onset of}} World War I, his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the Royal Navy as a medical officer on the destroyer HMS Lucifer.|$|E

The Gothic Hurstpierpoint church (1843–45), with its tower and spire, unlike his earlier churches was much closer to the Cambridge Camden Society's approach to church design. According to the his son Alfred, Barry later disowned these early church designs of the 1820s and <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> destroy them.|$|E
25|$|During the suspension, Ajax were {{in contact}} with other European clubs {{interested}} in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5million (£22.8million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool. Despite leaving while suspended, Suárez departed Ajax on good terms, and {{he was given a}} farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed. Ajax ended the 2010–11 season as Eredivisie champions and Suárez was given a winner’s medal for his 7 goals in 13 appearances. While he was at Ajax, Suárez scored 111 goals in 159 appearances.|$|E
500|$|The BBC website {{called the}} episode [...] "One {{of the most}} memorable episodes, if not one of the greatest– the satire on youth {{counterculture}} is well handled, and Homer's flashback to his youth is fabulous." [...] and IGN said the episode {{was one of the best}} of season seven. In a list of the 25 greatest guest voices on the show, released September 5, 2006, IGN ranked the Hullabalooza performers 23rd. The noise rock version of the end credits performed by Sonic Youth has been ranked among the best versions of the theme by Matt Groening and also by Chris Turner in his book Planet Simpson.

500|$|Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry {{opined that}} with [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] Archer [...] "gives FX {{something}} that the drama-heavy channel hasn't enjoyed for awhile — namely, a sharp comedic arrow in its quiver." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad applauded the character development in the [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] as it [...] "was fairly impressive." [...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were laugh out loud funny," [...] and noted that he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] "get {{rid of them}} all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, {{who were trying to}} [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", {{and that he}} <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes {{it to be an}} [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, he {{is at the same time}} fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, there are clear differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E

She often repeats characters from story to story, for example, Hubert and Rose Derdon, whose marriage is examined over stories set years apart. In the final Derdon story, The Drowned Man, Rose has died and Hubert has to pretend that he is overwhelmed with grief for his dead wife, [...] "...she was gone, she had been good, and he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> miss her." ...|$|E

He offered church courses in [...] "evangelical feminism" [...] and is quoted as saying [...] "the Bible is clear that {{men and women}} are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way."

She was later titled [...] "Rabba", a {{feminine}} version of the word [...] "rabbi", despite female rabbis in other movements being called [...] "rabbi". This led to complaints from the RCA, which led to Weiss stating he would not name future graduates as [...] "rabba". Weiss subsequently resigned from the RCA. However, in 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi.|$|E
