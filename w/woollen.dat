In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector {{had been}} closely linked {{with that of}} Rochdale and Saddleworth {{in the north and}} east; it was a <b>woollen</b> {{manufacturing}} district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. To ensure that the <b>woollen</b> trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that the deceased were to be buried in <b>woollen</b> garments.|$|E

When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for <b>woollen</b> products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, and only a few mills continue to operate.|$|E
