500|$|Tchaikovsky {{finished}} his final revision of Romeo and Juliet in 1880, and felt it a courtesy {{to send a}} copy of the score to Balakirev. Balakirev, however, had dropped out of the music scene in the early 1870s and Tchaikovsky had lost touch with him. He asked the publisher Bessel to forward a copy to Balakirev. A year later Balakirev replied. In the same letter that he thanked Tchaikovsky profusely for the score, Balakirev suggested [...] "the programme for a symphony <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> handle wonderfully well", a detailed plan for a symphony based on Lord Byron's Manfred. Originally drafted by Stasov in 1868 for Hector Berlioz as a sequel to that composer's Harold en Italie, the program had since been in Balakirev's care.|$|E
2500|$|As Bentham's {{thinking}} gained complexity, his style, unfortunately, deteriorated. [...] "It is a barbarous philosophical jargon" [...] {{even though}} it [...] "has {{a great deal of}} acuteness and meaning in it, <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be glad to pick out if you could. ... His works have been translated into French", quips Hazlitt. [...] "They ought to be translated into English." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{responded with}} an {{explanation}} of how his tax plan would affect a small business in this bracket. Obama said, [...] "If you're a small business, <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> qualify, first of all, you would get a 50 percent tax credit so you'd get a cut in taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, your taxes {{are going to stay}} the same. It is true that, say for 250 up— from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you'd go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under Bill Clinton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{have gone}} through the Crusades also," [...] Cuthbert said, [...] "and our persons are sacred. The sin of {{slitting}} our weazands, <b>which</b> <b>you</b> speak of, <b>would</b> therefore be so great that even the absolution on <b>which</b> <b>you</b> rely <b>would</b> barely extend to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"As for that," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you were}} not the ignorant <b>which</b> <b>you</b> are, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have known long ago that the subject of your remarks is not for any living man." ...|$|R

2500|$|What if a demon were {{to creep}} after you one day or night, in your loneliest loneness, and say: [...] "This life which {{you live and}} have lived, must be lived again by you, and innumerable times more. And mere will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and every sigh—everything unspeakably small and great in your life—must come again to you, {{and in the same}} {{sequence}} and series[...] [...] [...] The eternal hourglass will again and again be turned—and you with it, dust of dust!" [...] Would you not throw yourself down and curse the demon who spoke to you thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment, in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> answer him: [...] "Thou art a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Subjectivists assign numbers per {{subjective}} probability, i.e., as {{a degree}} of belief. The degree of belief has been interpreted as, [...] "the price at <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E, 0 if not E." [...] The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities. [...] The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution. [...] These data are incorporated in a likelihood function. The product of the prior and the likelihood, normalized, results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date. By Aumann's agreement theorem, Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar {{will end up with}} similar posterior beliefs. However, sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share.|$|E
2500|$|... ”(The angel) saw {{him while}} he was praying and said, 'You've tired God with your {{requests}} since a long time. You asked God and you requires to suffer here (bottom) the punishment of the sin of <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not be worthy of the perfect reward, and not to be deprived on his account from the perfect reward. I can attest to you that you have made a sin which deprive yourself of the higher reward; however you will have the fate of the saints. If you want to keep your kingdom and the lives of your children for long time, ceases to address this demand and in the resurrection your reward will be that of the just. If you want the highest reward and to be punished here, this shall be your punishment: you will be deprived of your kingdom, your children will be slaughtered before your eyes, and in the end your enemies will burn you. So choose what you want.” ...|$|E
