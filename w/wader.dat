5|$|The ruff is a <b>wader</b> in {{the large}} family Scolopacidae, the typical shorebirds. Recent {{research}} suggests that its closest relatives are the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata. It has no recognised subspecies or geographical variants.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the <b>wader</b> has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes <b>Wader.</b> German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of the}} first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including Gubben Noak and Fj√§riln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} temperature sensing pair of <b>waders</b> {{is introduced}} and tested. The water temperature at the stream-bed is interesting both for scientist studying the hyporheic zone {{as well as}} for, e. g., fishers spotting good fishing locations. A temperature sensor incorporated in <b>waders</b> worn {{by members of the}} public can give scientists an additional source of information on streamwater-groundwater interaction. A pair of <b>waders</b> was equipped with a thermistor and calibrated in the lab. Tests with both the <b>waders</b> and a reference thermometer in a deep polder ditch with a known localized groundwater contribution (i. e. boil) showed that the temperature sensing <b>waders</b> are capable of identifying the boil location. However, the temperature sensing <b>waders</b> showed a less pronounced response to changing water temperature compared to the reference thermometer, most likely due to the heat capacity of the person in the <b>waders.</b> This research showed that data from temperature sensing <b>waders</b> worn by the public and shared with scientists can be used by to decide where the most interesting places are to do more detailed and more expensive, research.

5|$|The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{is much larger}} than the female (the reeve), and has a {{breeding}} plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of <b>wader</b> chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas.|$|E

There are also over 4000 Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) farmed by approximately 280 families in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. It is unknown what impact the numbers of buffalo have on the ecosystem, however many avian species use their grazing areas for feeding and breeding sites including heron, egrets, stilts and <b>wader</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} <b>waders</b> in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large <b>waders</b> with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as <b>waders,</b> most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|R
50|$|The first {{manufactured}} <b>waders</b> {{were made}} {{as early as}} the 1850s by a company called Hodgman. When rubber became popular around 1912, they started making the <b>waders</b> out of this particularly waterproof and durable material.Then rubber was more or less perfected in 1942 for World War II, so they used the same technology to make <b>waders</b> that are closer to what we have today.|$|R
40|$|<b>Waders</b> inhabiting an area {{in which}} A. tyosenense is endemic were {{examined}} to determine if theyserve as reservoir hosts for the parasite. Of the <b>waders</b> examined, 4 individuals from 2 species were found tobe hosts for 18 to 1820 adult worms. Common and velvet scoters, which are known to be the final hosts ofA. tyosenense, are rare in the infected areas, while <b>waders</b> are prevalent and prey on the bivalves known tobe intermediate hosts of A. tyosenense. Thus, from the experimental results and circumstances presented herein,we conclude that <b>waders</b> are definitive and reservoir hosts of A. tyosenense in nature...|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} areas of {{grassland}} {{adjacent to the}} lower Idle, which are subject to periodic flooding, and which provide habitat for wintering and breeding birds. They form the Idle Washlands Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Historically, a much greater area would have functioned in this way, but {{much of it is}} now cut off from the river by high flood defence banks. The Washlands SSSI once covered an area of 250 hectares, which was used as grazing pasture during the summer months and was often covered by shallow flooding in the winter, but during the 1980s, further flood defence work and land drainage reduced this area to 88 hectares. Some work has been carried out under the National Environment Programme to ensure that the wildfowl and <b>wader</b> habitat is not lost completely, and the Environment Agency have produced a water level management plan to further protect the SSSI. Parts of the Mother Drain are also a designated SSSI.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to spend {{a year at the}} Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common redshank (a <b>wader)</b> and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.|$|E
500|$|The Charadriiformes {{order of}} birds {{contains}} 18 coastal seabird and <b>wader</b> families. Within the order, the terns form a lineage with the gulls, and, less closely, with the skimmers, skuas, and auks. Early authors such as Conrad Gessner, Francis Willughby, and William Turner did not clearly separate terns from gulls, but Linnaeus recognised the distinction in his 1758 Systema Naturae, placing the gulls in the genus [...] Larus and the terns in Sterna. He gave Sterna the description rostrum subulatum, [...] "awl-shaped bill", {{referring to the}} long, pointed bills typical of this group of birds, a feature that distinguishes them from the thicker-billed gulls. Behaviour and morphology suggest that the terns are {{more closely related to}} the gulls than to the skimmers or skuas, and although Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the family Sternidae for the terns in 1838, for many years they were considered to be a subfamily, Sterninae, of the gull family, Laridae. Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other Charadriiformes, were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and the misidentification of some finds.|$|E

40|$|Effectiveness of European {{initiatives}} to restore populations of meadow breeding <b>waders</b> is heavily debated. We studied field preference of meadow birds throughout the breeding season in four areas of over 100 ha each and related observed patterns of individual birds to in-field heterogeneity, sward height and management. Over the four areas, most <b>waders</b> {{were observed in}} the more heterogeneous fields at both the period of nest site selection and incubation. Additionally, fields grazed at relatively low-intensity for longer consecutive periods (on average 6 cows/ha for 30 d instead of 20 cows/ha for 2 d) were hosting high densities of lapwings but also black-tailed godwits. Our results suggest that in-field heterogeneity may be important for meadow breeding <b>waders</b> at the nest site selection and incubation stages. Conservation initiatives aimed at meadow breeding <b>waders</b> might improve their effectiveness when they increase the heterogeneity of fields. Grazing for longer consecutive periods at relatively low stocking rates might {{be a way to}} achieve this, if carried out at stocking rates low enough to allow <b>waders</b> to reproduce successfully.

40|$|Concentrations of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, Hg, Tl and Pb were {{determined}} {{in the liver}} of six species of resident and migratory <b>waders</b> collected in December 1997 from Calatagan Bay, Philippines. Renal Cd concentrations in these species were also determined. Trace element levels were observed to have either decreased or remained intact in the winter, suggestive that trace element burdens for migratory <b>waders</b> could be minimal during wintering. It seems that the migration distance of <b>waders</b> is a dominant factor in the accumulation of toxic elements such as Cd, Hg and Pb. Hepatic Cd concentrations of pintail snipe {{are likely to be}} incritical levels. While concentrations of persistent organochlorines such as PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, CHLs and HCB {{were determined}} in the whole bodies and adipose tissues of migratory and resident <b>waders</b> collected in April and December 1994. Accumulation patterns of OCs found in resident birds suggested that PCBs and CHLs were the predominant contents. Among the OCs, It was noted that migratory birds retained mostly high concentrations of DDTs. This finding could be reflective of the presence of these contaminants in the stopover and breeding/wintering ground of these <b>waders</b> in China and Russia. Whereas residual concentrations found in resident birds reflect the pollution status of the sampling area, those found in migratory <b>waders</b> reflect both the pollution status of the sampling area and their migratory routes. <b>Waders</b> are therefore useful bioindicators to elucidate the contamination status of toxic metals and organochlorines in breeding grounds, stopover sites and wintering grounds...|$|R

It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear, bracing, ethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in Blackmoor. Those were slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious <b>wader</b> might sink and vanish unawares.

6000|$|Of all his names--and {{there were}} many more that I picked up from {{watching}} him in a summer's outing--"Old Father Longlegs" [...] seemed always the most appropriate. There is a suggestion of hoary antiquity about this solemn <b>wader</b> of our lakes and streams. Indeed, of all birds he is the nearest to those ancient, uncouth monsters which Nature made to people our earth in its uncouth infancy. Other herons and bitterns have grown smaller and more graceful, with shorter legs and necks, to suit our diminishing rivers and our changed landscape. Quoskh is also, undoubtedly, much smaller than he once was; but still his legs and neck are disproportionately long, when one thinks of the waters he wades and the nest he builds; and the tracks he leaves in the mud are startlingly like those fossilized footprints of giant birds that one finds in the rocks of the Pliocene era, deep under the earth's surface, to tell what sort of creatures lived in the vast solitudes before man came to replenish the earth and subdue it.|$|E
60|$|Flint's, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our {{greatest}} lake and inland sea, lies {{about a mile}} east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to contain one hundred and ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in fish; but it is comparatively shallow, and not remarkably pure. A walk through the woods thither was often my recreation. It was worth the while, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the waves run, and remember the life of mariners. I went a-chestnutting there in the fall, on windy days, when the nuts were dropping {{into the water and}} were washed to my feet; and one day, as I crept along its sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon the mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was sharply defined, {{as if it were a}} large decayed pad, with its veins. It was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the seashore, and had as good a moral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have pushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at the north end of this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the <b>wader</b> by the pressure of the water, and the rushes which grew in Indian file, in waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank behind rank, as if the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in considerable quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots, of pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and perfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either solid grass, or have a little sand in the middle. At first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a pebble; yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch long, and they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover, the waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear down a material which has already acquired consistency. They preserve their form when dry for an indefinite period.|$|E
