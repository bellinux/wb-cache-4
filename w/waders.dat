5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} <b>waders</b> in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large <b>waders</b> with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as <b>waders,</b> most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of <b>waders,</b> swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding <b>waders</b> in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E

5|$|Some predators take {{advantage}} of the concentration of birds during migration. Greater noctule bats feed on nocturnal migrating passerines. Some birds of prey specialize on migrating <b>waders.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{small family}} of medium to large <b>waders</b> with strong black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. There are 9 species worldwide, with one {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Most {{birds are}} diurnal, but some birds, such as {{many species of}} owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during {{twilight}} hours), and many coastal <b>waders</b> feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.|$|E

5|$|The crab-plover {{is related}} to the <b>waders.</b> It resembles a plover but with very long grey legs and a strong heavy black bill similar to a tern. It has {{black-and-white}} plumage, a long neck, partially webbed feet and a bill designed for eating crabs.|$|E
5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} <b>waders</b> in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E

5000|$|During {{this time}} he met Hannes <b>Wader,</b> who invited him to {{collaborate}} with him in making an album, [...] "Ich hatte mir noch so viel vorgenommen". The success of this album led to Lämmerhirt accompanying <b>Wader</b> on tours - his first assignment as a professional musician. Werner collaborated with <b>Wader</b> on three further albums.|$|R
50|$|Remarkably, many of {{the social}} issues <b>Wader</b> sang about are still {{relevant}} today. Besides Franz Josef Degenhardt, <b>Wader</b> {{is one of the}} most active political singers in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{red-necked phalarope}} (Phalaropus lobatus) {{is a small}} <b>wader.</b> This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is migratory, and, unusually for a <b>wader,</b> winters at sea on {{tropical}} oceans.|$|R
5|$|Animal life {{indigenous}} to Malawi includes mammals such as elephants, hippos, big cats, monkeys, lemurs and bats; {{a great variety}} of birds including birds of prey, parrots and falcons, waterfowl and large <b>waders,</b> owls and songbirds. Lake Malawi has been described as having one of the richest lake fish faunas in the world, being the home for some 200 mammal, 650 bird, 30+ mollusc, and 5,500+ plant species.|$|E
5|$|Following genetic {{research}} in the early twenty-first century, the terns were historically treated as a separate family: Sternidae. Most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus, Sterna, {{with just a few}} dark species placed in other genera; in 1959, only the noddies and the Inca tern were excluded from Sterna. A recent analysis of DNA sequences supported the splitting of Sterna into several smaller genera. One study of part of the cytochrome b gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of <b>waders</b> in the suborder Thinocori. These results are in disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies, and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular convergent evolution between the terns and these <b>waders,</b> or the retention of an ancient genotype.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of <b>waders,</b> {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E

50|$|In 1978 Minton {{moved to}} Australia as {{managing}} director of Imperial Metal Industries Australia in Melbourne, Victoria. There he revitalised <b>wader</b> studies through the introduction of cannon-netting to the Victorian <b>Wader</b> Study Group (VWSG), which {{became one of the}} most active banding groups in the world. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Australasian <b>Wader</b> Studies Group (AWSG) of which he was founding chair, as well as in the establishment of Broome Bird Observatory.|$|R
50|$|The {{red phalarope}} (called grey phalarope in Europe), Phalaropus fulicarius, {{is a small}} <b>wader.</b> This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is migratory, and, unusually for a <b>wader,</b> {{migrating}} mainly on oceanic routes and wintering at sea on tropical oceans.|$|R
5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many <b>waders</b> (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as <b>waders</b> {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|Predators of <b>waders</b> {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take <b>waders,</b> {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Hannes <b>Wader</b> {{became one}} of the stars of the {{political}} left through his provocative songs. He was a member of the German Communist Party from 1977 to 1991. <b>Wader</b> even came under suspicions of terrorism because of his song Der Tankerkönig, a spoken song about kidnapping a tycoon.|$|R
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage <b>waders</b> visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E

5|$|The large tidal bay of Langstone Harbour lies to {{the east}} of Portsea Island.

One of the oldest local reserves in the county, built from reclaimed land in 1771, it provides an important habitat for migratory wildfowl and <b>waders.</b>|$|E
