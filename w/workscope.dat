Risk {{management}} programmes such as Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) and Non-Invasive Inspection (NII) {{deal with}} failure probabilities, and generate inspection <b>workscopes</b> to mitigate {{some of the}} risk [1] of plant operation. This is achieved by providing information on the presence and stage of advancement of pertinent degradation processes. The reliabilities of inspection techniques in common use are often over-stated, but increasingly, the concept of Probability of Detection (POD) {{for a range of}} inspection techniques is being applied to link the reliability of inspection with the requirements of the risk management programme. POD values are frequently derived from round robin exercises and trials, but there are further steps which need to be taken when applying this concept to ensure that the differences between trial and site conditions are taken into consideration. 1...|$|R

This report shall be fully reviewed and revised annually during the annual work planning process to reflect changes in BSC operations, facilities, and scope of work. Planned BSC work will be evaluated to determine if the work is covered by a previously defined activity, product or service (see Table 2); if work activities require redefinition or addition of a new activity; and if the significant evaluation for each environment aspect is still valid based on scope of planned work. New <b>workscope</b> initiated during the fiscal year through the Baseline Change Proposal process (i. e., not as part of the annual work plan) also will be reviewed for new environmental aspects and determination of whether the new <b>workscope</b> would change the significance rating of any environmental aspect.

40|$|The {{influence}} of client behaviour {{on a project}} is complex, including schedule restrictions on milestones, high demand on progress reports, delays in approving documents, and changes to <b>workscope</b> throughout the life-cycle. Quantifying these effects is important to project managers, in particular for effective communication with the client.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{challenge}} to generate relative permeability data for a complex reservoir management scenario in an unconsolidated heavy oil reservoir, a SCAL study was devised which focused on measurements that would provide tangible benefits to the operator.

40|$|Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 {{challenged}} us {{to dramatically}} reduce costs at Hanford. We began {{the year with}} an 8 percent reduction in our Environmental Management budget {{but at the same}} time were tasked with accomplishing additional <b>workscope.</b> This resulted in a Productivity Challenge whereby we took on more work at the beginning of the year than we had funding to complete. During the year, the Productivity Challenge actually grew to 23 percent because of recissions, Congressional budget reductions, and DOE Headquarters actions. We successfully met our FY 1995 Productivity Challenge through an aggressive cost reduction program that identified and eliminated unnecessary <b>workscope</b> and found ways to be more efficient. We reduced the size of the workforce, cut overhead expenses, eliminated paperwork, cancelled construction of new facilities, and reengineered our processes. We are proving we can get the job done better and for less money at Hanford. DOE`s drive to do it ``better, faster, cheaper`` has led us to look for more and larger partnerships with the private sector. The biggest will be privatization of Hanford`s Tank Waste Remediation System, which will turn liquid tank waste into glass logs for eventual disposal. We will also save millions of dollars and avoid the cost of replacing aging steam plants by contracting Hanford`s energy needs to a private company. Other privatization successes include the Hanford Mail Service, a spinoff of advanced technical training, low level mixed waste thermal treatment, and transfer of the Hanford Museums of Science and history to a private non-profit organization. Despite the rough roads and uncertainty we faced in FY 1995, less than 3 percent of our work fell behind schedule, while the work that was performed was completed with an 8. 6 percent cost under-run. We not only met the FY 1995 productivity challenge, we also met our FY 1995 - 1998 savings commitments and accelerated some critical cleanup milestones. The challenges continue. Budgets remain on the decline, even while the expectations increase. Yet we are confident in our ability to keep our commitments and goals by identifying new efficiencies in the Hanford cleanup program. We will also pursue new contracting arrangements that will allow us to foster greater competition and use more commercial practices while maintaining our commitment to the safety and health of the public, our workers, and the environment...|$|E

The timely lessons learned and insights will be valuable to other programs desiring to roadmap large amounts of <b>workscope,</b> but unsure how to successfully complete it, by adequately defining a strategy to develop alternatives and core technologies to ensure needed environmental technologies are available and allow delivery of viable alternatives. In early FY 02, Los Alamos National Laboratory's Environmental Science and Waste Technology Program Office was working jointly with Idaho National Environmental Engineering Laboratory to define and develop science and technology mini-roadmaps. We were defining and developing these mini-roadmaps to provide direction and guidance for DOE's Environmental Management's (DOE-EM) Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area (SCFA) in their development of target technologies. DOE EM's Strategic Plan for Science and Technology provides guidance for meeting science and technology needs {{with a view of the}} desired future and the long-term strategy to attain it. Program and technology mini-roadmapping were to be used to establish priorities, set program and project direction, and identify the high-priority science and technology need areas according to this document. In the past, EM science and technology needs collection is achieved through the DOE Site Technology Coordination Groups (STCG) across the complex. A future system for needs collection has not been defined. However, there is a need for gap analyses and a technical approach for the prioritization of these needs for DOE-EM to be strategic and successful in their technology research, development, demonstration, and deployments. To define the R&D projects needed to solve particular problems and select the project with the largest potential payoff will require analysis for project selection.

40|$|Because {{fossil fuel}} fired power plants {{are among the}} largest and most {{concentrated}} producers of CO{sub 2 } emissions, recovery and sequestration of CO{sub 2 } from the flue gas of such plants has been identified as one of the primary means for reducing anthropogenic CO{sub 2 } emissions. In this Phase II study, ALSTOM Power Inc. (ALSTOM) has investigated one promising near-term coal fired power plant configuration designed to capture CO{sub 2 } from effluent gas streams for sequestration. Burning fossil fuels in mixtures of oxygen and recirculated flue gas (made principally of CO{sub 2 }) essentially eliminates the presence of atmospheric nitrogen in the flue gas. The resulting flue gas is comprised primarily of CO{sub 2 }, along with some moisture, nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases like SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. Oxygen firing in utility scale Pulverized Coal (PC) fired boilers {{has been shown to be}} a more economical method for CO{sub 2 } capture than amine scrubbing (Bozzuto, et al., 2001). Additionally, oxygen firing in Circulating Fluid Bed Boilers (CFB's) can be more economical than in PC or Stoker firing, because recirculated gas flow can be reduced significantly. Oxygen-fired PC and Stoker units require large quantities of recirculated flue gas to maintain acceptable furnace temperatures. Oxygen-fired CFB units, on the other hand, can accomplish this by additional cooling of recirculated solids. The reduced recirculated gas flow with CFB plants results in significant Boiler Island cost savings resulting from reduced component The overall objective of the Phase II <b>workscope,</b> which is the subject of this report, is to generate a refined technical and economic evaluation of the Oxygen fired CFB case (Case- 2 from Phase I) utilizing the information learned from pilot-scale testing of this concept.

40|$|Forced outages and boiler {{unavailability}} {{in conventional}} coal-fired fossil power plants {{is most often}} caused by fireside corrosion of boiler waterwalls. Industry-wide, the rate of wall thickness corrosion wastage of fireside waterwalls in fossil-fired boilers has been of concern for many years. It is significant that the introduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission controls with staged burners systems has increased reported waterwall wastage rates {{to as much as}} 120 mils (3 mm) per year. Moreover, the reducing environment produced by the low-NOx combustion process is the primary cause of accelerated corrosion rates of waterwall tubes made of carbon and low alloy steels. Improved coatings, such as the MCrAl nanocoatings evaluated here (where M is Fe, Ni, and Co), are needed to reduce/eliminate waterwall damage in subcritical, supercritical, and ultra-supercritical (USC) boilers. The first two tasks of this six-task project-jointly sponsored by EPRI and the U. S. Department of Energy (DE-FC 26 - 07 NT 43096) -have focused on computational modeling of an advanced MCrAl nanocoating system and evaluation of two nanocrystalline (iron and nickel base) coatings, which will significantly improve the corrosion and erosion performance of tubing used in USC boilers. The computational model results showed that about 40 wt. % is required in Fe based nanocrystalline coatings for long-term durability, leading to a coating composition of Fe- 25 Cr- 40 Ni- 10 wt. % Al. In addition, the long term thermal exposure test results further showed accelerated inward diffusion of Al from the nanocrystalline coatings into the substrate. In order to enhance the durability of these coatings, it is necessary to develop a diffusion barrier interlayer coating such TiN and/or AlN. The third task 'Process Advanced MCrAl Nanocoating Systems' of the six-task project jointly sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI and the U. S. Department of Energy (DE-FC 26 - 07 NT 43096) - has focused on processing of advanced nanocrystalline coating systems and development of diffusion barrier interlayer coatings.

40|$|Circulating Moving Bed (CMB) {{combustion}} {{technology has}} its roots in traditional circulating fluidized bed technology and involves a novel method of solid fuel combustion and heat transfer. CMB technology represents a step change in improved performance and cost relative to conventional PC and FBC boilers. The CMB heat exchanger preheats the energy cycle working fluid, steam or air, to the high temperature levels required in systems for advanced power generation. Unique features of the CMB are the reduction of the heat transfer surfaces by about 60 % {{as a result of the}} enhanced heat transfer rates, flexibility of operation, and about 30 % lower cost over existing technology. The CMB Phase I project ran from July 2001 through March 2003. Its objective was to continue development of the CMB technology with a series of proof of concept tests. The tests were conducted at a scale that provided design data for scale up to a demonstration plant. These objectives were met by conducting a series of experiments in ALSTOM Power’s Multi-use Test Facility (MTF). The MTF was modified to operate under CMB conditions of commercial interest. The objective of the tests were to evaluate gas-to-solids heat transfer in the upper furnace, assess agglomeration in the high temperature CMB bubbling bed, and evaluate solids-to-tube heat transfer in the moving bed heat exchanger. The Phase I program results showed that there are still some significant technical uncertainties that needed to be resolved before the technology can be confidently scaled up for a successful demonstration plant design. Work remained in three primary areas: • scale up of gas to solid heat transfer • high temperature finned surface design • the overall requirements of mechanical and process design. The CMB Phase II <b>workscope</b> built upon the results of Phase I and specifically addressed the remaining technical uncertainties. It included a scaled MTF heat transfer test to provide the necessary data to scale up gas-to-solids heat transfer. A stress test rig was built and tested to provide validation data for a stress model needed to support high temperature finned surface design. Additional cold flow model tests and MTF tests were conducted to address mechanical and process design issues. This information was then used to design and cost a commercial CMB design concept.

Therefore it is essential that new targets be introduced for irradiation by the second quarter of FY 10 (HFIR cycle 427) to maintain supply of {sup 252 }Cf; the average irradiation period is {approx} 10 HFIR cycles, requiring about 1. 5 calendar years. The strategy for continued production of {sup 252 }Cf depends upon repairing and refurbishing the existing pellet and target fabrication equipment for one additional target production campaign. This equipment dates from the mid- 1960 s to the late 1980 s, and during the last target fabrication campaign in 2005 - 2006, a number of component failures and operations difficulties were encountered. It is expected that following the target fabrication and acceptance testing of the targets that will supply material for processing Campaign 75 a comprehensive upgrade and replacement of the remote hot-cell equipment will be required prior to subsequent campaigns. Such a major refit could start in early FY 2011 and would take about 2 years to complete. Scope and cost estimates for the repairs described herein were developed, and authorization for the work was received in July 2009 under the Remote Target Fabrication Refurbishment Task of the Enhanced Utilization of Isotope Facilities project (Project Identification Code 2005230) funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The goal of this project is to recover the capability to produce 4 - 5 curium targets for the irradiation period starting with HFIR cycle 427, currently scheduled to begin 2 / 17 / 10. Assuming success, the equipment would then be used to fabricate 6 - 7 additional targets to hold for the next irradiation campaign specified by the program. Specific objectives are the return to functionality of the Cubicle 3 Pellet Fabrication Line; Cubicle 2 Target Assembly equipment; and Cubicle 1 Target Inspection and Final Assembly system...|$|E
40|$|Lógica matemática. Engine health {{monitoring}} data {{is at the}} current core of the civil aeronautical business. The use of engine {{health monitoring}} systems has existed for several years, however it is only now that the in-flight knowledge gathered through this means {{is being used to}} address not only safety and reliability but to also understand customer operation and the overall engine condition. The assessment of EHM data for optimized life cycle cost, this is, the extension of an engine¿s time on wing and reduction of maintenance costs, has not yet been fully exploited due to several reasons. The main reasons however have been the lack of available data and the time and material type of maintenance operation common until now. Modern technology and a change towards TotalCare have influenced the current importance of EHM and its detailed assessment developments. This thesis develops a new EHM assessment methodology and its associated prognosis with the main objective of improving the level of engine maintenance required detail for a given engine prior to its maintenance shop visit. In addition, the prognosis methodology provides a significant long term capability {{on the state of the}} engine at module level which enables trade studies, not possible today. The existing EHM assessment capabilities concentrate on the safety and reliability aspects of engine containment and its reactive capabilities. The EHM methods developed are a proactive approach towards interpreting EHM data in its full extent, without filtering, in order to determine the actual condition of an engine at a modular level. The application of existing methods as BSS, and subsequently a possibilistic filter together with a fuzzy classifier, have enabled a new approach at understanding the internal engine condition through the combined assessment of all of the available variables. A subsequent classification method which enables the association of this level of deterioration to a known state or level of deterioration allows for a prediction of the level of engine deterioration, expected cost of maintenance and main exchanged parts to be replaced, to be performed. The assessment of events or condition changes does not directly reflect the deterioration of the engine. A sequence mining approach to the previous results obtained above was carried out to establish if certain sequences may be associated to specific levels of deterioration, transitions or to no significant changes. The additional knowledge provided through these methodologies to the current business is already a significant step change. A prognosis however was developed associated to this engine condition assessment which further enables the detailed understanding of the engine remaining useful life based on the integral of the instantaneous engine deterioration speed and the life objective established on its release. The result from this assessment is a new set of methods, which allows the maintenance facilities to optimize their limited capacity and predict in detail the level of <b>workscope</b> and man-hours to be employed for specific engine refurbishments. These methods also allow trade studies to be performed to optimize time on-wing versus over all engine level of deterioration...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} <b>workscope,</b> schedule and {{cost for the}} technology development tasks needed to satisfy the fuel and fission product transport Design Data Needs (DDNs) for the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR), operating in its role of transmuting transuranic (TRU) nuclides in spent fuel discharged from commercial light-water reactors (LWRs). In its application for transmutation, the GT-MHR {{is referred to as}} the Deep-Burn MHR (DB-MHR). This Fuel Development Plan (FDP) describes part of the overall program being undertaken by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), utilities, and industry to evaluate the use of the GT-MHR to transmute transuranic nuclides from spent nuclear fuel. The Fuel Development Plan (FDP) includes the work on fuel necessary to support the design and licensing of the DB-MHR. The FDP is organized into ten sections. Section 1 provides a summary of the most important features of the plan, including cost and schedule information. Section 2 describes the DB-MHR concept, the features of its fuel and the plan to develop coated particle fuel for transmutation. Section 3 describes the knowledge base for fabrication of coated particles, the experience with irradiation performance of coated particle fuels, the database for fission product transport in HTGR cores, and describes test data and calculations for the performance of coated particle fuel while in a repository. Section 4 presents the fuel performance requirements in terms of as-manufactured quality and performance of the fuel coatings under irradiation and accident conditions. These requirements are provisional because the design of the DB-MHR is in an early stage. However, the requirements are presented in this preliminary form to guide the initial work on the fuel development. Section 4 also presents limits on the irradiation conditions to which the coated particle fuel can be subjected for the core design. These limits are based on past irradiation experience. Section 5 describes the Design Data Needs to: (1) fabricate the coated particle fuel, (2) predict its performance in the reactor core, (3) predict the radionuclide release rates from the reactor core, and (4) predict the performance of spent fuel in a geological repository. The heart of this fuel development plan is Section 6, which describes the development activities proposed to satisfy the DDNs presented in Section 5. The development scope is divided into Fuel Process Development, Fuel Materials Development, Fission Product Transport, and Spent Fuel Disposal. Section 7 describes the facilities to be used. Generally, this program will utilize existing facilities. While some facilities will need to be modified, there is no requirement for major new facilities. Section 8 states the Quality Assurance requirements that will be applied to the development activities. Section 9 presents detailed costs organized by WBS and spread over time. Section 10 presents a list of the types of deliverables that will be prepared in each of the WBS elements. Four Appendices contain supplementary information on: (a) design data needs, (b) the interface with the separations plant, (c) the detailed development schedule, and (d) the detailed cost estimate...|$|E
40|$|Overview Fast {{reactors}} {{were evaluated}} {{to enable the}} transmutation of transuranic isotopes generated by nuclear energy systems. The motivation for this was that TRU isotopes have high radiotoxicity and relatively long half-lives, making them unattractive for disposal in a long-term geologic repository. Fast reactors provide an efficient means to utilize the energy content of the TRUs while destroying them. An enabling technology that requires research and development is the fabrication metallic fuel containing TRU isotopes using powder metallurgy methods. This project focused upon developing a powder metallurgical fabrication method to produce U-Zr-transuranic (TRU) alloys at relatively low processing temperatures (500 ºC to 600 ºC) using either hot extrusion or alpha-phase sintering for charecterization. Researchers quantified the fundamental aspects of both processing methods using surrogate metals to simulate the TRU elements. The process produced novel solutions {{to some of the}} issues relating to metallic fuels, such as fuel-cladding chemical interactions, fuel swelling, volatility losses during casting, and casting mold material losses. <b>Workscope</b> There were two primary tasks associated with this project: 1.

40|$|Given that {{fossil fuel}} fired power plants {{are among the}} largest and most {{concentrated}} producers of CO{sub 2 } emissions, recovery and sequestration of CO{sub 2 } from the flue gas of such plants has been identified as one of the primary means for reducing anthropogenic (i. e., man-made) CO{sub 2 } emissions. In 2001, ALSTOM Power Inc. (ALSTOM) began a two-phase program to investigate the feasibility of various carbon capture technologies. This program was sponsored under a Cooperative Agreement from the US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE). The first phase entailed a comprehensive study evaluating the technical feasibility and economics of alternate CO{sub 2 } capture technologies applied to Greenfield US coal-fired electric generation power plants. Thirteen cases, representing various levels of technology development, were evaluated. Seven cases represented coal combustion in CFB type equipment. Four cases represented Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems. Two cases represented advanced Chemical Looping Combined Cycle systems. Marion, et al. reported the details of this work in 2003. One of the thirteen cases studied utilized an oxygen-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. In this concept, the fuel is fired with a mixture of oxygen and recirculated flue gas (mainly CO{sub 2 }). This combustion process yields a flue gas containing over 80 percent (by volume) CO{sub 2 }. This flue gas can be processed relatively easily to enrich the CO{sub 2 } content to over 96 percent for use in enhanced oil or gas recovery (EOR or EGR) or simply dried for sequestration. The Phase I study identified the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB as having a near term development potential, because it uses conventional commercial CFB technology and commercially available CO{sub 2 } capture enabling technologies such as cryogenic air separation and simple rectification or distillation gas processing systems. In the long term, air separation technology advancements offer significant reductions in power requirements, which would improve plant efficiency and economics for the oxygen-fired technology. The second phase consisted of pilot-scale testing followed by a refined performance and economic evaluation of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. As a part of this <b>workscope,</b> ALSTOM modified its 3 MW{sub th} (9. 9 MMBtu/hr) Multiuse Test Facility (MTF) pilot plant to operate with O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 } mixtures of up to 70 percent O{sub 2 } by volume. Tests were conducted with coal and petroleum coke. The test objectives were to determine the impacts of oxygen firing on heat transfer, bed dynamics, potential agglomeration, and gaseous and particulate emissions. The test data results were used to refine the design, performance, costs, and economic models developed in Phase-I for the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB with CO{sub 2 } capture. Nsakala, Liljedahl, and Turek reported results from this study in 2004. ALSTOM identified several items needing further investigation in preparation for large scale demonstration of the oxygen-fired CFB concept, namely: (1) Operation and performance of the moving bed heat exchanger (MBHE) to avoid recarbonation and also for cost savings compared to the standard bubbling fluid bed heat exchanger (FBHE); (2) Performance of the back-end flash dryer absorber (FDA) for sulfur capture under high CO{sub 2 }/high moisture flue gas environment using calcined limestone in the fly ash and using fresh commercial lime directly in the FDA; (3) Determination of the effect of recarbonation on fouling in the convective pass; (4) Assessment of the impact of oxygen firing on the mercury, other trace elements, and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (5) Develop a proposal-level oxygen-fired retrofit design for a relatively small existing CFB steam power plant in preparation for a large-scale demonstration of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. Hence, ALSTOM responded to a DOE Solicitation to address all these issues with further O{sub 2 } fired MTF pilot testing and a subsequent retrofit design study of oxygen firing and CO{sub 2 } capture on an existing air-fired CFB plant. ALSTOM received a contract award from the DOE to conduct a project entitled 'Commercialization Development of Oxygen Fired CFB for Greenhouse Gas Control', under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42205 {{that is the subject of}} this topical report...|$|E
40|$|Felix Pinkus (1868 - 1947) was a {{well-known}} dermatologist beyond {{the borders of}} Germany and professor at the University of Berlin. But this was not his main <b>workscope,</b> as he was also Chief of Medicine of a big urban venerological clinic and ran a private practice. Apart from that he diligently published and worked on scientific projects. His main work is the 638 -pages long contribution âThe Normal Anatomy of Skinâ, published in the compendium by Jadassohn. Pinkus was a wealthy man and owned, like other dematologists of his time, a big collection of specialist books. 1939 he emigrated to the U. S. A. and managed to ship his whole movable goods and property there. In the year 1998 his grandson W. Pinkus donated his grandfatherâs scientific estate to the Clinic for Dermatology of the CharitÃ©. Surprisingly, among it appeared to be a by then unknown collection of special compendiums, {{which turned out to be}} a extraordenary private library. Since there existed no card index or library catalogue there were questions like e. g. : what does the library contain and according to which principles was it built up? Where and when did it come into existence and how is it to be integrated in the context of Pinkusâ life and lifework? Given material were on the one hand the donated 89 miscellanies and on the other hand a bibliography of approximately 165 publications by F. Pinkus, arranged by himself; this bibliography was completed within the scope of this present work and includes by now approximately 300 titles. Methodically the first step was to focus on the formal configuration and outer form, which means the labelling, caption and inscription as well as the year of publication, seperated into articles from scientific journals and dissertations. Apart from that the particular works were thematically assigned to the morphologic main fields of research and interest, the dermatovenereology and other medical expertises or to a special division called âstudentsâ and âleading historical figuresâ. The miscellanies are either labelled with numbers (1 - 90) or letters. At least 10 miscellanies are missing. The colours and patterns are either red, blue or black. The particular miscellanies are, with a few exceptions, headlined with topical headings: anatomy, eczema, hair et cetera. Another organising principle is the fact that indexes of contents in the form of short captions including the names of the authors are written on the spine or on the inside of the front cover- according to two different principles: âauthorsâ or âdiseasesâ. The library contains 3717 publications, 14 - 107 per miscellany; 3240 of these are articles taken from journals, 477 are dissertations. Some miscellanies contain prescious editions, bound to Pinkusâ fields of interest- among them the oldest work of the whole library, published in the year 1925. Drawing conclusions from the discribed organization, it is to say, that the miscellanies 1 - 60 were bound no earlier than 1918, the remaining miscellanies after 1930, the year of the first publication. The fields of interest and research are weighted to different degrees: nature study with 55 works in 10 miscellanies, nerves (55 in 8), embryology (41 in 15) and nails (12 in 7). Hair, the domain which his fame was based on, contains 204 works in 14 miscellanies; the topic anatomy of skin contains 111 works in 23 miscellanies, among them a large number of works about neuroanatomy of animals. Pinkus had his own works bound next to those by other authors. The lionâs share are works about siphilis and gonorrhoea with 2393 publications, among those a large number about siphilis and Salvarasan. Further topics are: eczema, skin tumors and other dermatoses. Other well represented medical expertises are internal medicin, surgery and urology. There are only a few works concerning gynaecology, which leads to the assumption that those have to be a part of the missing miscellanies. Out of approximately 300 own works Pinkus only used 33, preferred about hair or syhilis- appearently those of which he thought they are of scientific importance. His large amount of papers and reports as well as those works about hygiene and law within the scope of his activity within the Reichsgesundheitsrat and in the German Society of Sexually Transmitted Diseases are missing. Among the historical individuals there are a few who jump out- his teachers and his collegues at the School of Dermatology in Berlin around Edmund Lesser, the first professor in ordenary at the CharitÃ©. A presentable selection of the works by P. Ehrlich, one of his relatives, is existing; even an original writing by the Nobel prize winner is bound. After taking all these facts into account, as a general conclusion it is safe to say that this library provides an insight into Pinkusâ working manner and his distinguished personality. Apart from that it is a contemporary document about the German dermatology around 1900 - 1930 with a special focus on the School of Dermatology in Berlin. As one of the most important results it should be noted that on the one hand the library is the basis for the summary reports Pinkus published regularly and which are not mentioned in the biographical appreciations so far. Beyond that it has to be beared in mind that Pinkus would not have been able to manage his continued publishing activity without this scientific collection. However, the fact that the library is not library-oriented organised, but a rather individually customized scientific collection makes it exceptional. It is a rare, yet unique compilation of publications concerning dermatology and related domains and apart from that a valuable historical document, because comparable collections have been dispersed or destroyed. And after all, it is a special document of a german-jewish destiny...|$|E
