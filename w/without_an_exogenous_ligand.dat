40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} coupled {{expression}} profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) -dependent regulation of gene expression in mouse keratinocytes, a cell type that expresses PPARβ/δ in high concentration. Results Microarray analysis elucidated eight {{different types of}} regulation that modulated PPARβ/δ-dependent gene expression of 612 genes ranging from repression or activation <b>without</b> <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand,</b> repression or activation with an exogenous ligand, {{or a combination of}} these effects. Bioinformatic analysis of ChIP-seq data demonstrated promoter occupancy of PPARβ/δ for some of these genes, and also identified the presence of other transcription factor binding sites in close proximity to PPARβ/δ bound to chromatin. For some types of regulation, ATF 4 is required for ligand-dependent induction of PPARβ/δ target genes. Conclusions PPARβ/δ regulates constitutive expression of genes in keratinocytes, thus suggesting the presence of one or more endogenous ligands. The diversity in the types of gene regulation carried out by PPARβ/δ is consistent with dynamic binding and interactions with chromatin and indicates the presence of complex regulatory networks in cells expressing high levels of this nuclear receptor such as keratinocytes. Results from these studies are the first to demonstrate that differences in DNA binding of other transcription factors can directly influence the transcriptional activity of PPARβ/δ. </p...|$|E

Analytical evidence shows that the amount of chemically detectable nitrite in various samples of the derivative is not proportional to the cupric copper detected by EPR. The kinetics of oxidation of hemocyanin as a function of protein concentration and pH, in the presence of nitrite and ascorbate, is consistent with a scheme in which NOz is the reactive oxidant.

Hemoglobin and myoglobin are the most prominent members of this protein family. Unexpectedly {{a few years ago}} a new member was discovered and called neuroglobin (Ngb), being predominantly expressed in the brain. Ngb is a single polypeptide of 151 amino acids and despite the small sequence similarity with other globins, it displays the typical globin fold. Oxygen, nitric oxide, or carbon monoxide can displace the distal histidine which, in ferrous Ngb as well as in ferric Ngb, is bound to the iron, yielding a reversible adduct. Recent crystallographic data on carboxy Ngb show that binding of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> is associated to structural changes involving heme sliding and a topological reorganization of the internal cavities; in particular, the huge internal tunnel that connects the bulk with the active site, peculiar to Ngb, is heavily reorganized. We report the results of extended (90 ns) molecular dynamics simulations in water of ferrous deoxy and carboxy murine neuroglobin, which are both coordinated on the distal site, in the latter case by CO and in the former one by the distal His 64 (E 7). The long timescale of the simulations allowed us to characterize the equilibrated protein dynamics and to compare protein structure and dynamical behavior coupled to the binding of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand.</b> We have characterized the heme sliding motion, the topological reorganization of the internal cavities, the dynamics of the distal histidine, and particularly the conformational change of the CD loop, whose flexibility depends ligand binding...|$|R

More importantly, SB-RI and CD 36, which are homologous to SCARB 2, have so far been shown to transport cholesterol and fatty-acids, respectively (Neculai et al., 2013). SCARB 2, however, hasn’t been demonstrated to possess the ability of binding and/or delivering lipid despite containing a large cavity that might accommodate lipid ligands.

To search <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand(s),</b> we screened pathogenic fungi using cell line expressing Mincle, FcRγ, and NFAT-GFP reporter. We found that Mincle specifically recognizes the Malassezia species among 50 different fungal species tested. Malassezia is a pathogenic fungus that causes skin diseases, such as tinea versicolor and atopic dermatitis, and fatal sepsis. However, the specific receptor on host cells has not been identified. Mutation of the putative mannose-binding motif within C-type lectin domain of Mincle abrogated Malassezia recognition. Analyses of glycoconjugate microarray revealed that Mincle selectively binds to α-mannose but not mannan. Thus, Mincle may recognize specific geometry of α-mannosyl residues on Malassezia species and use this to distinguish them from other fungi. Malassezia activated macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. To elucidate the physiological function of Mincle, Mincle-deficient mice were established. Malassezia-induced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages from Mincle−/− mice was significantly impaired. In vivo inflammatory responses against Malassezia was also impaired in Mincle−/− mice.

40|$|Dendritic cells bearing antigen {{efficiently}} aggregate {{and stimulate}} antigen-specific T cells. We describe an experimental {{model in which}} an initial, apparently antigen-independent binding step is followed by ligation of the TCR. The model is the polyclonal response to mAb to the CD 3 portion of the TCR complex. Epidermal and thymic dendritic cells utilize low levels of Fc receptors to present the anti-CD 3 mAb and induce mitogenesis. Within 3 h of coculture, most of the dendritic cells have formed clusters with the resting T lymphocytes, and these clusters are the site for subsequent DNA synthesis and cell growth. However, the binding of dendritic cells to T cells proceeds as efficiently {{in the absence of}} anti-CD 3 as in its presence, and anti-FcR mAb does not block. CD 3 and Fc receptors are essential for the subsequent mitogenesis response in dendritic-T cell clusters. Because <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> for the TCR {{does not seem to be}} required for the extensive polyclonal clustering of resting lymphocytes to dendritic cells, we suggest that an antigen-independent mechanism mediates the initial interaction.

40|$|An elegant {{methodology}} {{based on}} the synergistic combination of coordination and host-guest chemistry led to the highly efficient synthesis of a unique C(3 v) -symmetrical, calix[6]arene-based molecular platform with three protected amino arms in alternating positions. The key step involves {{the formation of a}} stable supramolecular host-guest Zn(II) complex from a C(6 v) -symmetrical calix[6]hexaamine. Indeed, {{in the presence of a}} polar neutral guest and a strong donor that acts as <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand,</b> three alternating amino groups of this calix[6]hexaamine are selectively coordinated to the Zn(II) ion while the three others remain free and are thus much more reactive toward chemical reagents. In addition to this protective role, the metal centre preorganises the C(3 v) -symmetrical complex in such a way that the uncoordinated NH(2) groups are directed toward the outside of the cavity; they are then accessible for a chemical transformation. Hence, reaction of these alternating free amino groups with a protective reagent (i. e. Boc(2) O) followed by zinc decoordination quantitatively and selectively yielded the 1, 3, 5 -tris-Boc-protected calixarene derivative on a gram scale. It was shown that the presence of all the partners of the key intermediate Zn complex (i. e. the metal centre, the <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> and the included guest) is crucial for a high selectivity. Finally, a two step sequence that led to a C(3 v) -symmetrical 1, 3, 5 -tris-acetylated calix[6]hexaamine through the removal of the Boc groups illustrates that the 1, 3, 5 -tris-protected calix[6]hexaamine is a promising molecular platform.

An aspartic acid-to-lysine change at position 84 (D 84 K) of ecotropic Moloney MLV Env abolishes virus binding and infection. We recently identified lysine 234 (rK 234) in mATRC 1 as a residue that influences virus binding and infection. Here we show that D 84 K virus infection increased 3, 000 -fold on cells expressing receptor with an rK 234 A change and 100, 000 -fold on cells expressing an rK 234 D change. The stronger complementation of D 84 K virus infection by rK 234 D than by the rK 234 A receptor suggests that although the major reason for loss of infection of D 84 K and D 84 R virus is due to steric hindrance and charge repulsion, the loss of an interaction of D 84 with receptor appears to contribute as well. Taken together, these results indicate that D 84 is very close to rK 234 of mATRC 1 in the bound complex and there is likely an interaction between them.

While the majority of human S 100 proteins share 25 - 65 % sequence similarity, S 100 A 7 and its recently identified paralog, S 100 A 15, display 93 % sequence identity. Intriguingly, however, S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 15 serve distinct roles in inflammatory skin disease; S 100 A 7 signals through the receptor for advanced glycation products (RAGE) in a zinc-dependent manner, while S 100 A 15 signals through a yet unidentified G-protein coupled receptor in a zinc-independent manner. Of the seven divergent residues that differentiate S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 15, four cluster in a zinc-binding region and the remaining three localize to a predicted receptor-binding surface. Results To investigate the structural and functional consequences of these divergent clusters, we report the X-ray crystal structures of S 100 A 15 and S 100 A 7 D 24 G, a hybrid variant where the zinc ligand Asp 24 of S 100 A 7 has been substituted with the glycine of S 100 A 15, to 1. 7 [*]Å and 1. 6 [*]Å resolution, respectively. Remarkably, despite replacement of the Asp ligand, zinc binding is retained at the S 100 A 15 dimer interface with distorted tetrahedral geometry and a chloride ion serving as <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> fourth <b>ligand.</b> Zinc binding was confirmed using anomalous difference maps and solution binding studies that revealed similar affinities of zinc for S 100 A 15 and S 100 A 7. Additionally, the predicted receptor-binding surface on S 100 A 7 is substantially more basic in S 100 <b>A</b> 15 <b>without</b> incurring structural rearrangement. Conclusions Here we demonstrate that S 100 A 15 retains the ability to coordinate zinc through incorporation of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> resulting in <b>a</b> unique zinc-binding site among S 100 proteins. The altered surface chemistry between S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 15 that localizes to the predicted receptor binding site is likely responsible for the differential recognition of distinct protein targets. Collectively, these data provide novel insight into the structural and functional consequences of the divergent surfaces between S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 15 that may be exploited for targeted therapies. </p...|$|R

This peculiarity might be related to the still-unknown physiological function of Ngb.

We have also used Fourier transform IR spectroscopy of WT and mutant CO-ligated Ngb to examine structural heterogeneity in the active site. Upon CO binding, the distal histidine retains (by and large) its position, whereas the heme group slides deeper into a preformed crevice, thereby reshaping the large cavity (≈ 290 Å 3) connecting the distal and proximal heme sides with the bulk. The heme relocation is accompanied by a significant decrease of structural disorder, especially of the EF loop, which may be the signal whereby Ngb communicates hypoxic conditions.

The size of a halogen atom or an alkyl group at the meta or para position had relatively little effect on the severity of induced anemia. The ability of an arylhydrazine to induce hemolytic anemia paralleled its ability to produce a ferrihemochrome with <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand,</b> probably the corresponding aryldiazene. In general, rapid and complete formation of ferrihemochrome occurred with arylhydrazines that induced severe anemia.

We propose a mechanism of arylhydrazine-induced oxidative denaturation based on the simultaneous formation of hydroxyl radical and aryldiazene ferrihemochrome in a reaction of oxyhemoglobin with arylhydrazine. We suggest that after oxidation of the porphyrin ring is initiated by a hydroxyl radical, oxidative cleavage of the ring is facilitated by the presence of a large ligand in the heme crevice.

For viral vectors, the ideal approach is to genetically engineer new ligands into the capsid proteins of the virus to generate a single agent to mediate therapy. Although this is ideal, this insertion of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> from one structural context into the differing structural context of a capsid protein can ablate {{the function of the}} ligand or disrupt viral assembly and function. To address this context problem for adenoviral vectors, we have engineered a “context-specific” peptide-presenting phage library. We have displayed a 12 -amino-acid (12 -mer) random peptide library between the H and I sheets of the fiber protein of adenovirus type 5 on the pIII protein of fd bacteriophage. This library was used for peptide selection against C 2 C 12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Five rounds of selection combined with four rounds of clearing on nontarget cells selected one primary peptide designated 12. 51, which bound target C 2 C 12 cells approximately 100 -fold better than the positive control RGD peptide. Translation of 12. 51 back into the fiber protein produced a ligand-modified adenoviral vector that mediated 14 -fold-better transduction of target C 2 C 12 cells. These data suggest context-specific peptide-presenting libraries may allow selection of compatible peptide ligands for functional translation into viral vectors for retargeting...|$|R
40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: The {{vertebrate}} {{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates cellular responses to environmental polycyclic and halogenated compounds. The naive receptor is believed to reside in an inactive cytosolic complex that translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of xenobiotic detoxification genes after activation by ligand. Objectives: We conducted an integrative genomewide analysis of AHR gene targets in mouse hepatoma cells and determined whether AHR regulatory functions may {{take place in the}} absence of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand.</b> Met h o d s: The network of AHR-binding targets in the mouse genome was mapped through a multipronged approach involving chromatin immunoprecipitation/chip and global gene expression signatures. The findings were integrated into a prior functional knowledge base from Gene Ontology, interaction networks, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, sequence motif analysis, and literature molecular concepts. Results: We found the naive receptor in unstimulated cells bound to an extensive array of gene clusters with functions in regulation of gene expression, differentiation, and pattern specification, connecting multiple morphogenetic and developmental programs. Activation by the ligand displaced the receptor from some of these targets toward sites in the promoters of xenobiotic metabolism genes. Con c l u s i o n s: The vertebrate AHR appears to possess unsuspected regulatory functions that may be potential targets of environmental injury. Key w o r d s: Ah receptor, ChIP-on-chip, gene–environment interactions, gene regulation, gene target networks.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we used {{functional}} MRI in awake rats {{to investigate the}} pain response that accompanies intradermal injection of capsaicin into the hindpaw. To this end, we used BOLD imaging together with a 3 D segmented, annotated rat atlas and computational analysis to identify the integrated neural circuits involved in capsaicin-induced pain. The specificity of the pain response to capsaicin was tested in a transgenic model that contains a biallelic deletion of the gene encoding for the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV 1). Capsaicin is <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> for the TRPV 1 receptor, and in wild-type rats, activated the putative pain neural circuit. In addition, capsaicin-treated wild-type rats exhibited activation in brain regions comprising the Papez circuit and habenular system, systems that play important roles in the integration of emotional information, and learning and memory of aversive information, respectively. As expected, capsaicin administration to TRPV 1 -KO rats failed to elicit the robust BOLD activation pattern observed in wild-type controls. However, the intradermal injection of formalin elicited a significant activation of the putative pain pathway as represented by such areas as the anterior cingulate, somatosensory cortex, parabrachial nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Notably, comparison of neural responses to capsaicin in wild-type versus knock-out rats uncovered evidence that capsaicin may function in an antinociceptive capacity independent of TRPV 1 signaling. Our data suggest that neuroimaging of pain in awake, conscious animals {{has the potential to}} inform the neurobiological basis of full and integrated perceptions of pain...|$|R
500|$|This led to {{even lower}} demand for both {{products}} and labour, which further deepened {{the recession and}} made it ever more difficult to generate tax revenues and fight public indebtedness. According to Financial Times chief economics commentator Martin Wolf, [...] "structural tightening does deliver actual tightening. But its impact is much less than one to one. A one percentage point reduction in the structural deficit delivers a 0.67 percentage point improvement in the actual fiscal deficit." [...] This means that Ireland e.g. would require structural fiscal tightening of more than 12% to eliminate its 2012 actual fiscal deficit. A task {{that is difficult to}} achieve <b>without</b> <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> eurozone-wide economic boom. According to the Europlus Monitor Report 2012, no country should tighten its fiscal reins by more than 2% of GDP in one year, to avoid recession.|$|R
40|$|The minimal {{nutrient}} {{requirements of}} one-cell rabbit embryos for cleavage during in vitro culture were investigated. One-cell rabbit embryos were cultivated {{in a simple}} salt solution supplemented with the macro-molecule polyvinylalcohol (P VA) either alone or with bovine serum albumin (BSA), amino acids, or {{one of a number}} of potential energy sources. At the end of 48 h culture, the embryos were stained with aceto-orcein HCI and the number of nucleated cells per embryo counted. One-cell embryos in medium with PVA but <b>without</b> <b>an</b> <b>exogenous,</b> fixed nitrogen source or energy substrate cleaved to a mean of 10. 4 cells per embryo. Addition of the putative energy substrates-phosphoenolpyruvate, malate, acetate, and lactate-resulted in nonsignificant increases in cleavage rate. Glucose, pyruvate, a group of 20 amino acids from Ham’s F-JO medium, and BSA gave a statistically significant doubling of the cleavage rate. These results indicate that the one-cell rabbit embryo, unlike the mouse embryo, has significant endogenous energy sources and that <b>an</b> <b>exogenous,</b> fixed nitrogen source is not essential for cleavage...|$|R
40|$|The heme {{prosthetic}} group {{can be held}} into proteins {{in a variety of}} ways. Most often amino acid side chains coordinate {{one or both of the}} two available axial coordination sites of the heme iron. Coordination of both sites, such as in cytochrome b 5, produces a good electron transfer protein but excludes the binding of <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligands.</b> In hemoglobins, coordination can occur at a single site (as in the “pentacoordinate” hemoglobins associated with oxygen transport), or at both sites (as in the “hexacoordinate” hemoglobins found in a wider distribution of organisms and functions). Surprisingly, hexacoordination in hemoglobins is usually reversible and <b>a</b> variety of <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligands</b> can bind most hexacoordinate hemoglobins. Reversible coordination brings a variety of chemical features to hexacoordinate hemoglobins by affecting their affinity for ligands, redox equilibrium, and the kinetics and extent of electron transfer. These reactions are reviewed for hexa- and pentacoordinate hemoglobins with the goal of using these characteristics for understanding potential functions of hexacoordinate hemoglobins in different species...|$|R
