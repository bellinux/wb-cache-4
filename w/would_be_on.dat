5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who {{would be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E

5|$|After beating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in April 1994, Diesel was in {{the midst}} of a major push. He was {{considered}} the top contender to Bret Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and a match was booked for King of the Ring in which only Hart's title <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the line. The feud intensified on the May 30, 1994, episode of Monday Night Raw during Jerry Lawler's interview segment, The King's Court. During an interview with Hart, Lawler invited Diesel and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart. After a verbal confrontation, Diesel performed his Jacknife Powerbomb on Hart, after which Diesel, Michaels and Lawler attacked Hart. The following week on Monday Night Raw, Bret announced that he would have a family member, whose identity would be a secret until the pay-per-view, in his corner to help prevent Michaels from interfering on Diesel's behalf.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A mooring mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships.|$|E
