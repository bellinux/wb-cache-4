5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the <b>wet</b> season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the <b>wet</b> season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one <b>wet</b> season, but areas of the tropics can have two <b>wet</b> seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} <b>wet</b> season.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} <b>wet</b> and dry seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the <b>wet</b> season. Animals have adaptation and survival {{strategies for the}} wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the <b>wet</b> season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the <b>wet</b> season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wet,</b> or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with <b>wet</b> seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have <b>wet</b> summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or <b>wet</b> seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the <b>wet</b> season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The <b>wet</b> season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} land reclamation (drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching) on the change of soil chemical properties of acid sulphate soils from Kalimantan. Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, <b>wetting,</b> and diluting that is define as (1) drying continuously after <b>wetting</b> = W 1, (2) <b>wetting</b> continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and diluting =W 3; and (4) <b>wetting</b> and diluting. The result of experiments show that continuous drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) and drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and diluting (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3). The continouos <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) and <b>wetting</b> thatfollowed diluting (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively. The effects of drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching on the total soluble acidity, Soluble Al and soluble H, especially on the strong reactive soils are very significant. All of the exchangeble bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) on the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) are lower than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) respectively. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1), the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that follow diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) decrease exchangable Mg, especially on strong reactive soils (R 4), but contradictive to low reactive soils (R 1). The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) increase exchangable Na, especially on low reactive soils (R 1), but the <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 3, W 4) decreases exchangable Na...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} water <b>wetting</b> in large diameter horizontal oil-water two-phase flows. Four types of oil, one model oil and three crude oils, {{have been used in}} conjunction with a 1 wt % NaCl brine as working fluids. Flow pattern visualization, wall conductance probes, corrosion monitoring and wall fluid sampling were successfully applied in this investigation. Based on the overlapping information from these four techniques, three types of phase <b>wetting</b> regimes (stable water <b>wetting,</b> intermittent <b>wetting</b> and stable oil <b>wetting)</b> were observed. Comprehensive phase <b>wetting</b> maps were constructed where and the boundaries between these water <b>wetting</b> regimes are identified. It was found that the oil type has a significant effect on the transition from stable oil <b>wetting</b> to intermittent <b>wetting</b> and that much of the influence can be ascribed to the physical properties of the oil: density, viscosity and surface/interfacial tension.

40|$|Internal {{corrosion}} occurs {{only when}} corrosive water <b>wets</b> the pipe inner wall. However, water <b>wetting</b> {{is one of}} most important missing links of our current overall understanding of internal corrosion {{of oil and gas}} pipelines. In this study, extensive experimental studies on water <b>wetting</b> in large diameter horizontal oil-water pipe flows were carried out. Four main techniques (wall conductance probes, Fe 2 + concentration monitoring, wall sampling and flow pattern visualization) were used to determine phase <b>wetting</b> on the internal wall of pipe at different superficial oil and water velocities. Four flow patterns were observed: stratified flow, stratified flow with mixed layer, semi-dispersed and dispersed flows. Three types of phase <b>wetting</b> regimes (water <b>wetting,</b> intermittent <b>wetting</b> and oil <b>wetting)</b> were determined. A comprehensive phase <b>wetting</b> map was obtained based on the overlapping information from these techniques. 1 Based on the results of corrosion monitoring, it was found that a complete absence of corrosion is guaranteed only when oil <b>wetting</b> occurs. At the same superficial oil velocity, the corrosion rate under water <b>wetting</b> is much higher than that under intermittent <b>wetting.</b> Phase <b>wetting</b> significantly affects the corrosion rate. A comparison was carried out between the mechanistic water entrainment and separation model 8 - 9 and experimental results. A good agreement was achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of crusts {{are closely related}} to soil erosion in red loam under a rainfall condition. To better manage crust-prone soils and to accurately predict hydrological processes, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of crust formation. <b>Wetting</b> rate is an important factor influencing soil aggregate stability and crust formation. In this study, we considered two factors, <b>wetting</b> rate (slow 2 mm h(- 1), fast 50 mm h(- 1)) and rainfall quantity (intensity of 60 mm h(- 1) with every 5 min as a treatment from 0 to 60 min). The results show that soil in the fast <b>wetting</b> treatment had higher bulk density, stronger crust strength and lower infiltration rate. Therefore, the fast <b>wetting</b> treatment had higher ability to resist the damage caused by raindrops and to resist soil erosion, and higher runoff rate than slow <b>wetting</b> treatment. Crust formation-destruction-formation process appeared sharp in fast <b>wetting</b> treatment but gentle in slow <b>wetting</b> treatment. Surface morphology and profile microstructure show that crusts were formed earlier in fast <b>wetting</b> treatment. The aggregates in slow <b>wetting</b> treatment had higher stability than those in fast <b>wetting</b> treatment. The crust strength of the soil pretreated by slow <b>wetting</b> was weaker than that in fast <b>wetting</b> case due to the persistent presence of stable aggregates, albeit microaggregates, and, consequently, reduced levels of compaction...|$|R

Experimental results unveiled that adding of 0. 3 wt% Ni into Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder can improve the <b>wetting</b> on Cu substrate when NC and WS fluxes are used.

Among the fluxes, worst performance was observed for R-type flux. Very large contact angles were recorded for both solders with this kind of flux. Experimental results also revealed that higher solder bath temperature played an important role to lower the contact angle, to increase the <b>wetting</b> force and to enhance the <b>wetting.</b> Computer modeling of <b>wetting</b> balance test also revealed that both the <b>wetting</b> force and meniscus height are inversely proportional to the contact angles.
