25|$|Upton is {{considered}} one of the most influential young reformers of the United States Army in the 19th century, arguably in U.S. history. He has been called the U.S. Army's counterpart to United States Navy reformer and strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. Although his books on tactics and on Asian and European armies were considered influential, his greatest impact was a work he called The Military Policy of the United States from 1775. He <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> on the paper, but it was incomplete at the time of his death in 1881.|$|E
25|$|Baum wrote a new Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz, {{with a view}} {{to making}} it into a stage production, which was titled The Woggle-Bug, but Montgomery and Stone balked at {{appearing}} when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> on a musical version of Ozma of Oz, which eventually became The Tik-Tok Man Of Oz. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer Oliver Morosco to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz, but this was ultimately realized as a film.|$|E

25|$|Zevon {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Beverly Cope (née Simmons) and William Zevon. His father was a Jewish {{immigrant}} from Russia, whose original surname was Zivotovsky. William Zevon worked as a bookie who handled volume bets and dice games for the notorious Los Angeles mobster Mickey Cohen; he <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> in Cohen's Combination, {{in which he was}} known as Stumpy Zevon, and was best man at Cohen's first wedding. Warren's mother was from a Mormon family and was of English descent. They moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon was an occasional visitor to the home of Igor Stravinsky, where he briefly studied modern classical music alongside Robert Craft. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old; he soon quit high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York City to become a folk singer.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. When he spoke to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s it was known that {{electric}} shocks, even small shocks, could induce ventricular fibrillation in dogs' hearts and more powerful shocks could reverse the fibrillation.

The outcome proved a windfall for the BC economy, earning McGeer a reputation as [...] "the man who flattened the Rockies."
