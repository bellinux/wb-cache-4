50|$|In {{the past}} two decades the steel plate shear wall (SPSW), also known as the steel plate wall (SPW), has been used in a number of {{buildings}} in Japan and North America as part of the lateral force resisting system. In earlier days, SPSWs were treated like vertically oriented plate girders and design procedures tended to be very conservative. Web buckling was prevented through extensive stiffening or by selecting an appropriately thick <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> until more information became available on the post-buckling characteristics of web plates. Although the plate girder theory seems appropriate for the design of an SPW structure, a very important difference is the relatively high bending strength and stiffness of the beams and columns that form the boundary elements of the wall. These members are expected to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall behaviour of a building incorporating this type of system and several researchers have focused on this aspect of SPWs. The energy dissipating qualities of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> under extreme cyclic loading has raised the prospect of using SPSWs as a promising alternative to conventional systems in high-risk seismic regions. A further benefit is that the diagonal tension field of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> acts like a diagonal brace in a braced frame and thus completes the truss action, which is known to be an efficient means to control wind drift.|$|E

Corrosion shapes were decided according to actual bridge inspection data. The results demonstrated that extent of shear capacity depends on both corrosion shapes and rates of thickness reduction.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The performance of thin-plate structural systems {{is known to be}} greatly influenced by the effect of buckling and post-buckling behaviour. The main factors, which affect the buckling, and post-bucking characteristics and consequently the ultimate performance of thin plate structural components, are noted to be structural geometry, material properties, loading and boundary conditions and geometric imperfections. Present day knowledge and understanding of the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of thin plate structures is at a fairly sophisticated level due to the intensive research that has been carried out over the years in this field of study. This is particularly true for the case of compressive loading whereby the collapse and unloading failure mechanics of thin plate structures has been well documented for this case. The same is not true for the case of shear loading and although much work has been carried out {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and in-depth understanding of shear post-ultimate conditions which essentially defines the initiation and progressive development of the plastic failure mechanisms of thin plate structural system. This thesis makes a contribution to the area of study by taking advantage of the developments in recent years of computational technology and computing power to develop finite element modelling strategies and solution procedures using the commercially available FE package PATRAN/NASTRAN to describe in detail the post-buckled shear failure of thin plate structural systems. The work of this thesis provides an in-depth understanding of the complex post-buckled failure mechanics associated with thin-plate structures subjected to in-plane shear displacement and combined shear and compression loading. Simply supported in-plane normal stress free and straight edge boundaries are employed to examine the shear performance as well as the failure mechanisms of thin and stocky <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> Finite element modelling strategies are developed, which are able to describe the complete loading history from the onset of initial buckling through the nonlinear elastic post-buckling to initial material yielding and its further propagation throughout the structure leading to the development of an appropriate failure mechanism that causes final plastic collapse and subsequent load drop-off. The post-buckled failure response of the thin plate structures is determined with due consideration being given to the effects of geometric and material nonlinearities. The effect of stiffeners on structural performance is detailed for single and multiple asymmetrical and symmetrically attached stiffeners. The degrading influence on the structural performance of cut-outs as well as the considerable redeeming effect due to reinforcements attached at the cut-out boundaries is highlighted in this thesis. The work of the thesis covers the in-plane shear displacement loading of thin <b>web</b> <b>plates,</b> thin <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> with transverse stiffeners, <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> with cut-outs, <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> with stiffened cut-outs and the interactive shear and compressive loading of transversely stiffened web structures.

50|$|Designers {{pioneering}} {{the use of}} SPWs did {{not have}} much experience nor existing data to rely upon. Typically, <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> design failed to consider post-buckling behaviour under shear, thus ignoring the advantage of the tension field and its added benefits for drift control and shear resistance. Furthermore, the inelastic deformation capacity of this highly redundant system had not been utilized, also ignoring the significant energy dissipation capability that is of great importance for buildings in high-risk seismic zones. One of the first researchers to investigate the behaviour of SPWs more closely was Kulak at the University of Alberta. Since the early 1980s, his team conducted both analytical and experimental research focused on developing design procedures suitable for drafting design standards (Driver et al., 1997, Thorburn et al., 1983, Timler and Kulak, 1983, and Tromposch and Kulak, 1987). Recent research in the United States by Astaneh (2001) supports the assertion by Canadian academia that unstiffened plate, post-buckling behaviour acts as a capable shear resisting system.|$|E

The <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> in steel shear walls are categorized according to their ability to resist buckling. The <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> can be sufficiently stiffened to preclude buckling and allow the full shear strength of the web to be reached.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{steel plate}} shear wall (SPSW) is a {{building}} lateral force resisting system that comprises a moment frame (the boundary frame) and slender steel diaphragms (web plates) welded or bolted inside the boundary frame. The system resists lateral load primarily through tension field {{action in the}} web plates. <b>Web</b> <b>plate</b> forces are anchored by the boundary frame members. The Seismic Provisions currently require the boundary members to be capacity designed assuming the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> has fully yielded in tension and forms a pure tension field at a prescribed angle computed from an elastic analysis. In design, web plates are frequently modeled {{as a series of}} parallel, inclined tension-only truss elements. This research focused on the development and magnitude of in-plane <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> stresses due to seismic demands and how these are transferred to and resisted by the boundary frame, specifically the vertical boundary members, or elements (VBEs). The evolution of <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> stress is controlled by the material properties, slenderness ratio, hardening behavior, <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> aspect ratio and cyclic drift history. Several small-scale cyclic tests of steel web plates were conducted to investigate the hardening, pinching and snap-though behavior, and to validate observations made in numerical studies that the tension field inclination angle migrates to a fixed value close to 45 degrees as the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> is loaded plastically. Using statistical methods, the magnitude of hardening expected for typical <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> materials was then estimated for the MCE level earthquake. The results of the experiments and ABAQUS analyses of single story SPSWs are used to develop and implement a new OpenSees uniaxial material model, SPSW-WP, to be applied to truss elements, specifically for SPSW applications. The material was designed to mimic the effects of in-plane web buckling and accurately capture the effects of material hardening, stiffness degradation, residual shear strength, <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> slenderness and correctly model the reloading drift under cyclic loading conditions. The model is calibrated using ABAQUS analyses of single story SPSWs with a range of material hardening characteristics and geometries. It is then validated using both ABAQUS models and with cyclic test data. Finally the new material model is incorporated into the analyses of two six-story SPSWs; one utilizing slender A 36 steel web plates, and one with stocky, low yield point LYP 100 steel web plates. The story drift demands and VBE demands are compared and contrasted with ABAQUS analyses of the equivalent structures for four DBE and four MCE level ground motions. <b>Web</b> <b>plate</b> hardening and changes in the tension field inclination angle were found to be significant but had only a moderate influence on VBE demands.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The Steel Plate Shear Wall (SPSW) system, is an {{innovative}} seismic lateral force resistant system, which has experienced increased use {{over the last}} three decades. The SPSW system is composed of boundary elements which anchor <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> that develop diagonal tension fields. A number of SPSW buildings have been built in Japan and North America. The SPSW system offers high ductility and good energy dissipation. Compared to concrete shear walls, they o er thinner wall thickness that can reduce the self weight of the structures and save floor area, faster construction and are easier to retro t. However, SPSW systems suffer from low stiffness, difficult construction sequences and relative unfamiliarity that may lead to higher costs. Therefore, the Steel Plate Shear Wall with Coupling (SPSW-WC) system has been developed to negate these disadvantages. The SPSW-WC system can lead to greater material efficiency by linking a pair of SPSW piers together with coupling beams at the floor levels. A design procedure has been developed for the SPSW-WC system. However, the seismic response of the resulting SPSW-WC systems has not been extensively studied to ensure uniform performance over a range of coupling levels. <b>Web</b> <b>plates</b> {{play a significant role in}} resisting lateral loads and dissipating energy in the SPSW-WC system.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{self-centering}} {{steel plate}} shear wall (SC-SPSW) is a lateral force-resisting {{system that is}} capable of providing enhanced seismic performance, including recentering after an earthquake. The primary lateral strength of the SC-SPSW is provided by thin steel infill plates, referred to as web plates, that are connected to the beams and columns. During lateral sway, the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> resists lateral load through the development of tension field action, and energy is dissipated through ductile yielding of the plate. Unlike conventional steel plate shear walls, the boundary frame in the SC-SPSW employs post-tensioned (PT) beam-to-column connections that are allowed to rock open during lateral sway. If properly designed, the PT connections eliminate damage in the boundary frame and provide restoring forces necessary to recentering the building during an earthquake, thus reducing post-earthquake downtime and repair costs. This research builds upon previous analytical and numerical proof-of-concept studies on SC-SPSWs. Experimental testing was conducted to better understand SC-SPSW behavior and seismic performance. The experimental program consisted of (1) a series of large-scale subassembly cyclic tests to evaluate the impact of various design parameters on SC-SPSW behavior and component demands and (2) full-scale two-story pseudo-dynamic tests to evaluate system performance at three different seismic hazard levels. These tests also investigated possible performance-enhancing variations in SC-SPSW design that were not considered in the previous proof-of-concept study. Post-tensioned column base connections were proposed to eliminate damage in the columns and provide additional recentering. SC-SPSWs with web plates that are only connected to the beams were proposed as a means of mitigating <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> tearing and reducing column demands. Methods for designing PT column base connections and SC-SPSWs with web plates connected to the beams only are presented. Numerical investigations were conducted to evaluate different methods of modeling <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> behavior in SC-SPSWs, ranging from the relatively simple tension-only strip model to the more complex shell element model. When used in cyclic or dynamic analyses, the tension-only strip model was found to significantly underestimate the energy dissipation provided by the <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> while the shell element model was too computationally demanding for wide-spread implementation. Based on numerical and experimental observations, a modified tension-compression strip model was proposed to conservatively approximate the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> unloading resistance and the additional energy dissipation it provides. Nonlinear response history analyses were conducted to asses seismic performance of several three- and nine-story SC-SPSW designs. These analyses compared SC-SPSWs with web plates connected to the beams and columns (fully-connected) and SC-SPSWs with web plates connected to the beams only (beam-connected). Results showed that SC-SPSWs using beam-connected web plates had smaller boundary frame members and larger drift demands than their fully-connected <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> counterparts; however, they were still able to meet proposed performance objectives. The numerical simulations also investigated the effects of considering the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> unloading resistance in the model (e. g. the traditional tension-only model vs. the modified tension-compression model).

40|$|Fifty-two {{tests on}} the {{behaviour}} and ultimate strength of perforated steel <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to inplane bending and shearing are described. The plates were tested as the webs of I-section girders. Their depth/thickness ratios varied between 90 and 180. All {{but two of the}} panels had an aspect ratio (b/d) of 0. 7, and each perforated panel had a centrally placed hole. The holes had unreinforced edges and were of either circular or elongated circular shape. These panels are typical of those found in ship-type structures. The effect of varying the shear/moment ratio (F/M) in the panel on its strength was studied. Stresses in one test panel were calculated from strain measurements at loads up to collapse. It was found that the experimental results for the stockiest plates could be reasonably predicted using an existing approach based on simple plastic theory. This approach could not be applied to the more slender panels. The method based on the tension field approach which has been proposed for the analysis of such panels was unable to predict the failure loads of the panels teste...|$|R
