5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the General Synod and its seminary at Gettysburg, the Ministerium {{established}} a new seminary in Philadelphia, and asked Charles Porterfield Krauth {{to head the}} seminary (now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia). This was followed, in 1867, with the Ministerium being joined by thirteen other church bodies in a more conservative and confessional organization known as the General Council.|$|E
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of a celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002), and several collaborations, Aguilera decided to {{incorporate}} elements of 1930s and 1940s musical styles in her follow-up album project. She commented that she wished to revolve {{as an artist and}} a visionary in between production of the records. Aguilera sent letters to various producers that she hoped could help her <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel.|$|E
5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt {{it was time to move}} on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E
5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of a {{documentary}} on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and was touched by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E

5|$|Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an {{instructor}} at the University of Kansas, and Norman Foster Ramsey, a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and {{an officer in the}} Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding the Rock Island Arsenal. He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Direction</b> d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E

5|$|The first broods {{were formed}} by the Overmind, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of each brood being {{delegated}} to a cerebrate. A brood was engineered for a specific function, which impacted its numerical strength and the diversity of its strains. The Terrans gave the Great War broods reporting names based on beasts found in Earth mythology. The Command Wing broods were responsible for defending the Overmind and searching for new species for assimilation. These broods did not engage in front-line combat unless necessary. The Command Wing included the Tiamat Brood, Baelrog Brood, and Fenris Brood. The Attack Wing broods were the Swarm's front-line forces, meant to conquer and occupy worlds. The wing's primary broods were amongst {{the largest in the}} Swarm. The Attack Wing included the Garm Brood, Jormungand Brood, and Surtur Brood.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, features Beyoncé wearing a modern-day tank top, performing the song against a blank background which changes {{back and forth}} between white and black. Interspersed are some scenes from a photo shoot within her film Dreamgirls. This version appears on the Dreamgirls DVD release. In the director's cut of this version, Beyoncé is seen posing for a photo shoot not featured in the film in which she wears very outlandish clothing. As the shoot progresses it becomes more and more evident that Beyoncé is not happy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the shoot and when she is handed a bird to pose with she becomes fed up, walks away and strips down to the black tank top and tights underneath. She then climbs the staircase of the building to the rooftop and finishes singing the song.|$|E

He then lost to Triple H at Unforgiven 2007 in a no disqualification match where the no disqualification rule only applied to Carlito. In late 2007, Colón requested his release from the WWE as he was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of his character. Following a meeting with Vince McMahon, however, he was convinced to stay. On December 10, 2007, he was featured in a ladder match at the Raw 15th Anniversary against Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy won. Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify for the money in the bank ladder match at Wrestlemania 24. He failed to win at the event. Carlito then formed a tag team with Santino Marella. The team was placed in several matches involving the World Tag Team Championship, twice being named the number one contenders; however, they lost the relevant championship matches.|$|E

5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E
5|$|Roundabout {{moved into}} Deeves Hall, a rented old {{farmhouse}} {{near the village}} of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.|$|E
