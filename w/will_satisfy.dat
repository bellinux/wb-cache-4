5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it <b>will</b> <b>satisfy</b> this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

25|$|An {{intentional}} tort requires an overt act, {{some form of}} intent, and causation.

Causation can be satisfied {{as long as the}} defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} the study of inner models is of {{interest}} is that {{it can be used to}} prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original model <b>will</b> <b>satisfy</b> both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.|$|E
25|$|The {{corresponding}} normalised solutions f'n of the Beltrami equations {{and their}} inverses g'n satisfy uniform Hölder estimates. They are therefore equicontinuous on any compact subset of C; {{they are even}} holomorphic for |z| > R. So by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can be assumed that both f'n and g'n converge uniformly on compacta to f and g. The limits <b>will</b> <b>satisfy</b> the same Hölder estimates and be holomorphic for |z| > R. The relations f'n∘g'n = id = g'n∘f'n imply that in the limit f∘g = id = g∘f, so that f and g are homeomorphisms.|$|E

500|$|Also, before {{applying}} this test in considering if {{a piece of}} legislation contravenes Article 12, {{there needs to be a}} presumption that an impugned law is constitutional. This presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature has to make laws which operate differently as regards different groups of persons, so as to give effect to its policies. An academic, Tan Yock Lin, has acknowledged the benefit of this presumption as it [...] "tells the challenger what he must do". The person challenging the constitutionality of a legislative or executive classification must expect to [...] "furnish cogent and compelling evidence of unequal treatment". Postulating examples will not be sufficient for the purposes of rebuttal.
