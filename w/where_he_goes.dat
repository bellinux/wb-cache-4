5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes).</b> Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E
500|$|... "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show" [...] is {{the eighteenth}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season.

Homer opens the can, resulting in a huge explosion that lands him in the hospital, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> into a coma. At Homer's bedside, the Simpson family reminisce, mainly about moments relevant to Homer's life.|$|E

500|$|Nardine Saad from Los Angeles Times {{noted that}} the video [...] "briefly makes us {{sympathetic}} toward the Biebs and his eyebrow-raising behavior this last year, which has included speeding, possibly smoking pot and frequently walking around shirtless" [...] and named the fans' part [...] "memorable". The same noted Ryan Seacrest's website, saying [...] "proves that no matter <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> {{there will always be}} plenty of fans to support him". Entertainment Weekly notes that it [...] "show off Justin Bieber in an all-white suit and in a leather-jacket outfit. Ludacris appears for a guest-verse, indicating that this may all be a stealth prequel to Fast & Furious 6". Idolator's Christina Lee described the video as [...] "flashy" [...] and wrote that it [...] "offers a rose-colored view of his superstar status".|$|E
500|$|Writer Peter C. Newman {{concluded}} that [...] "Stursberg's rage dominates his crackling autobiography - as does his grief {{for the lost}} network's unfulfilled promise." [...] Columnist Martin Knelman, in the Toronto Star, advised, [...] "Don't expect a balanced account of the troubles that brewed. This is strictly the Gospel According to Richard - entertaining but also blatantly self-serving. ... He had no appetite for compromise, consensus or conciliation. He seemed to relish the chance to shock people, make them angry and create dramatic showdowns. Now with this book, he seizes the chance to attack those who stood in his way." [...] Knelman found the best parts were [...] "the passages <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> after his perceived enemies with a hatchet", while Newman found [...] "the volume's most devastating profile [...] that of CBC president Hubert Lacroix".|$|E
500|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), {{recovering}} from his Borg assimilation, visits his family's vineyard in La Barre, France, which {{is run by}} his elder brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) {{along with his wife}} Marie (Samantha Eggar) and son René (David Birkin). Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have to learn to live with what he did, regardless of <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree and looks up at space.|$|E

500|$|Miller {{had been}} warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was {{unprepared}} for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find [...] "dirt" [...] on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: [...] "There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. and this country questioning my friends and trying to discredit me." [...] Attempts were made to implicate him {{in the murder of}} a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they would not say who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the Sunday Times that Miller [...] "is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They will monitor <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baden-Powell {{wanted a}} Scout {{to learn to}} make his own decisions, as he felt this would help the {{children}} grow and mature. Baden-Powell wrote that a Scout should paddle his own canoe, metaphorically speaking. He should travel not in a rowing boat, with his back to <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> rowed by others and someone else at the rudder, but alone in a canoe: facing the future, paddling and steering by himself. Scouting teaches self-reliance by bringing the Scouts into a challenging, somewhat risky environment, without help in the direct neighbourhood. Therefore the program is based on an adult, adventurous, and appealing outdoor life. [...] "A man's job cut down to boy's size." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E
