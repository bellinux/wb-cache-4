25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> with her.|$|E
25|$|Milito's wife Lynda {{claims in}} her book Mafia Wife that when Louie Milito did not come home or call, she went to see Gravano at his home. Lynda said Gravano gave her $5,000 and cut all ties to her. Lynda also wrote that a friend saw Gravano driving Louie Milito's Lincoln {{and was able to}} {{identify}} it by damage done to the car before Louie Milito went missing. Lynda Milito <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> foul {{in her book}} after Gravano testified he had not been the shooter in Louie Milito's murder; she said that a Gambino family member later informed her Gravano had shot and killed Louie Milito, contrary to what Gravano had told the FBI. Gravano, however, claims in his book Underboss that after Milito was killed, he finished the construction work Milito was having done on his home and continued to support Lynda Milito and her family.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|During the shoot, Harris {{suffered}} from depression, {{and believed that}} her co-stars {{did not take the}} film as seriously as she did. At times, she <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. Bloom did not speak to Harris while filming continued, which worsened her depression. Afterward, Bloom told Harris that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled. [...] Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters [...] "step on one another's lines", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, the Whitney Museum held a {{retrospective}} of her work, Yoko Ono: Objects, Films, marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move me so much that I <b>would</b> <b>cry,</b> there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change[...] [...] [...] I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified." ...|$|E
500|$|One check over a magistrate's {{power was}} collegiality (collega), which {{required}} that each magisterial office be held concurrently {{by at least}} two people. For example, two consuls always served together. The check on the magistrate's power of Coercion was Provocatio, which was an early form of due process (habeas corpus). Any Roman citizen had the absolute right to appeal any ruling by a magistrate to a plebeian tribune. In this case, the citizen <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> [...] "provoco ad populum", which required the magistrate {{to wait for a}} tribune to intervene, and make a ruling. Sometimes, the case was brought before the College of tribunes, and sometimes before the Plebeian Council (popular assembly). Since no tribune could retain his powers outside of the city of Rome, the power of Coercion here was absolute. An additional check over a magistrate's power was that of Provincia, which required a division of responsibilities.|$|E

500|$|Cho {{attended}} the Poplar Tree Elementary School in Chantilly, an unincorporated, small community in Virginia's Fairfax County. According to Kim Gyeong-won, who met Cho {{in the fifth}} grade and took classes with him, Cho finished the three-year program at Poplar Tree Elementary School in one and a half years. Cho was noted for being good at mathematics and English, and teachers pointed to him as an example for other students. At that time, according to Kim, nobody disliked Cho and he [...] "was recognized by friends as a boy of knowledge;... a good dresser who was popular with the girls." [...] Kim added that [...] "I only have good memories about him." [...] An acquaintance noted that [...] "Every time he came home from school he <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> and throw tantrums saying he never wanted to return to school" [...] when Cho first came to the U.S. in about the second grade.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|By May 1892, it was {{apparent}} that additional funds were needed to complete the fair's buildings. The Company had sold stock, and the City of Chicago had issued bonds to pay for the exposition, but the construction budgets had been greatly underestimated. The Company sought a subsidy of $5 million from the federal government to complete the work. When a direct appropriation met congressional opposition, supporters proposed that the $5 million be in the form of special half dollars which could be sold as souvenirs. The United States had never struck a commemorative, and it was anticipated by organizers that the coins could be sold to the public at double their face value. The bullion would come from the melting of underweight and obsolete silver coins already held by the Treasury, so there would be no expense to the government beyond the costs of production. During the debate over the bill in the Senate, Iowa Senator William B. Allison foresaw, [...] "they would not only be souvenirs for this day and generation but would be transmitted... to the 200 millions that were to dwell here in the future. Children <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> for them and the old men would demand them." [...] But Ohio Senator John Sherman warned, [...] "the enormous number of [...] half dollars would destroy their value as souvenirs". With Congress anxious to escape the summer Washington heat, the matter was compromised and the amount cut to $2.5 million, thus five million half dollars. Congress passed authorizing legislation on August 5, 1892.|$|E

Many other prisoners were executed. Louis's queen, Marguerite de Provence, suffered from nightmares. [...] The news (the capture of her husband Louis) terrified her so much, that every time she fell asleep, she fancied that her room was filled with Saracens, and she <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> out, [...] "Help! help!"

2500|$|Kramer, however, {{had several}} caveats about Perry. He says that Bill Tilden once called Perry [...] "the world's worst good player". Kramer says that Perry was [...] "extremely fast; {{he had a}} hard body with sharp reflexes, and he could hit a {{forehand}} with a snap, slamming it on the rise—and even on the fastest grass. That shot was nearly as good as Segura's two-handed forehand." [...] His only real weakness, says Kramer, [...] "was his backhand. Perry hit underslice off that wing about 90 % of the time, and eventually {{at the very top}} levels—against Vines and Budge—that was what did him in. Whenever an opponent would make an especially good shot, Perry <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> out 'Very clevah.' I never played Fred competitively, but I heard enough from other guys that 'Very clevah' drove a lot of opponents crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|When All My Children debuts, the Kane family {{consists}} of Erica, her mother, Mona (Frances Heflin), and her absent father, film director Eric Kane (Albert Stratton). Mona spoils Erica {{to fill the}} void Eric left behind. Despite this, the writers scripted the relationship between Mona and Erica as tumultuous with Mona disapproving of Erica's antics and Erica blaming Mona for her father's desertion. The relationship is later developed into a strong bond. The writers layered their interactions with [...] "raw edges" [...] and humor. [...] "Erica idealized her father—who was a son of a bitch—and she refused to see that," [...] Heflin said. Whenever Eric disappoints Erica, she blames her mother. [...] "Then, of course, would come the moment of breakdown when she <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> on [...] shoulder," [...] Helfin said. [...] "So it's more or less human. Really, more human and less saccharine than most of the mother/children relationships on soaps. It has an awful lot of bit in it." [...] After Mona's death in 1994, the character continues on as a god-like figure Erica looks to for guidance repeatedly throughout the series.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "the Regulator" [...] Hitchen expresses his grievance for [...] "such abominable practices" [...] carried out by [...] "such as have assumed the title of thief-takers" [...] that [...] "if these should hold their peace, the stones in the city <b>would</b> <b>cry</b> out" [...] and thereupon adds that he hopes [...] "effectual care will be taken {{to have the same}} strictly examined into." [...] Hitchen gives one example out of many similar cases, where Wild saves his accomplices and prosecutes an innocent one, at least in that particular crime. Three [...] "notorious rogues", William Mathews, Christopher Matthews and Obadiah Lemmon robbed a lady in a coach near St. Paul's Churchyard. Wild for fear of losing these profitable criminals, met the three and arranged for one of them to be an evidence in the court, which meant him giving the names of [...] "a numerous train of offenders" [...] and convicting them. {{but at the same time}} he should not have mentioned the stealing of a dozen of handkerchiefs and other robberies involving Wild directly as a receiver, otherwise they would lose their [...] "factor" [...] by [...] "bringing his own neck into the noose and put it into power of every little prig". As a result, the three offenders escaped the justice and the thief-taker received a reward of £40 for arresting and hanging [...] "shim-sham thieves", Hugh Oakley and Henry Chickley.|$|E
