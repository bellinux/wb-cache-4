In 1996, a patent application was filed for this method at the company of Adobe, which has yet to be used in any typesetting program.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automatic text formatters usually produce poor page layouts: pages {{may have}} {{different}} lengths, <b>widow</b> <b>lines</b> abound, and figure placement is hard to control and often wrong. This paper describes {{a different approach to}} page makeup. add to the output of a text formatter extra information that tells how various elements of the document should appear on the page. A postprocessor uses this information to make all pages the same height, prevent the creation of <b>widow</b> and orphan <b>lines,</b> place footnotes, and float figures to a suitable posi tion on an appropriate page. V/e have implemented such a postprocessor for text processed by the TROFF text formatter. The current version handles these page-makeup tasks for onean...|$|R

40|$|This {{creative}} project investigates {{a method}} for translating a run-length encoded data file of letterforms into bit mapped images. Each letterform is broken (cracked) into primitive strokes. Each primitive stroke is represented by equally spaced runlength spline points within a 72 unit counting system. The strokes are ordered from left to right, allowing a direct scan-line conversion using an on-off character fill. Most commercial letterforms are stored in an outline format. Outline letterfomrs must be converted to vector edges, and then quick sorted into two dimensional arrays of edges for scan-line conversion (no overlapping outlines are allowed). The author's method stores primitives in a left to right ordered format that eliminates the sorting routine. In order to display the letterforms as a body of text, an interpreted description language was developed. The language command structure {{is embedded in the}} text file and interpreted at run time. The language controlls the sizing and placement of letterforms at five levels. The page attributes controlls the placement of page margins, column margins, windows, headers, footers, etc. The Paragraph attributes controlles first word indents, paragraph indents, <b>widow</b> <b>lines,</b> etc. The line attributes controlles the text line length, inter word and character spacing, line leading, additional line indents, type of line justification and hyphenation, etc. No attributes were established at the word level. The character attributes controlles the type size, type style, degree of slant (poor man's italic), expansion or contraction, etc. Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306 Thesis (M. S.)

50|$|Blakesley {{station was}} linked to nearby Blakesley Hall by a 15 in gauge which ran from a {{terminal}} located {{to the west of}} the station at the rear of the down platform. The railway conveyed coal, farm supplies and guests to the Hall over a distance of 0.75 mi. It was opened in 1903 by the owner of Blakesley Hall, Charles Bartholomew, a Yorkshire colliery owner and shareholder in the East and West Junction Railway. Two Cagney 4-4-0 locomotives and rolling stock were obtained from the United States. The miniature railway, which was fully signalled using Sykes electric banner signals, was particularly popular on Blakesley Fete days. Following Bartholomew's death in 1919, his <b>widow</b> allowed the <b>line</b> to remain and be used by tourists on special occasions. The track was lifted in 1940 after being sold to an estate in Yorkshire.|$|R
2500|$|Formally, the {{algorithm}} defines a value called badness {{associated with each}} possible line break; the badness is increased if the spaces on the line must stretch or shrink too much to make the line the correct width. Penalties are added if a breakpoint is particularly undesirable: for example, if a word must be hyphenated, if two lines in a row are hyphenated, or if a very loose line is immediately followed by a very tight line. The algorithm will then find the breakpoints that will minimize the sum of squares of the badness (including penalties) of the resulting lines. If the paragraph contains [...] possible breakpoints, the number of situations that must be evaluated naively is [...] However, by using the method of dynamic programming, the complexity of {{the algorithm}} can be brought down to [...] (see Big O notation). Further simplifications (for example, not testing extremely unlikely breakpoints such as a hyphenation in the first word of a paragraph) lead to an efficient algorithm whose running time is almost always of order [...] A similar algorithm is used to determine the best way to break paragraphs across two pages, in order to avoid <b>widows</b> or orphans (<b>lines</b> that appear alone on a page {{while the rest of the}} paragraph is on the following or preceding page). However, in general, a thesis by Michael Plass shows how the page breaking problem can be NP-complete because of the added complication of placing figures. TeX's line breaking algorithm has been adopted by several other programs, such as Adobe InDesign (a desktop publishing application) and the GNU fmt Unix command line utility.|$|R
