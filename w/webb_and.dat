5|$|Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family, Morris {{came under the}} strong {{influence}} of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded a decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, <b>Webb,</b> <b>and</b> others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, Morris assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.|$|E
5|$|His {{red brick}} arts and craft façades for the Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington, south London (1900–03), were {{influenced}} by Philip <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Henry Wilson and feature steeply pitched roofs, corner towers and stone window surrounds.

His sisters-in-law are Bella Freud and Susie Boyt and his father-in-law was the painter Lucian Freud.|$|E
5|$|The Mall, a {{ceremonial}} approach {{route to the}} palace, was designed by SirAston <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> completed in 1911 {{as part of a}} grand memorial to Queen Victoria. It extends from Admiralty Arch, across StJames's Park to the Victoria Memorial. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading a}} tract, Why Are The Many Poor?, {{issued by the}} {{recently}} formed Fabian Society, Shaw went to the society's next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884.

He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> also Annie Besant, a fine orator.|$|E

5|$|Framed by Judah Wright in 1752 for Joseph Webb, the three-and-a-half story {{house was}} {{designed}} {{with a large}} gambrel roof that provides extra storage space. Webb was a successful merchant who had ships trading in the West Indies and ran a local store; he married Mehitabel Nott and had six children before his death {{at the age of}} 34. The executor of the estate was Silas Deane who assisted Mrs. Webb financially and emotionally. Deane later married Mrs. <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> built a house next door. The eldest child, Joseph Webb Jr., then 12 {{at the time of his}} father's death, inherited the house.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|His socialist {{activism}} monopolised his time, {{forcing him}} to abandon a translation of the Persian Shahnameh. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, {{with whom he had}} strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had become increasingly conservative, and felt that the DF were exploiting Morris for his talents and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris' circle of artistic comrades, only <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene {{can be traced to the}} early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948 Pei was {{recruited}} by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss {{was known for his}} loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.|$|E

Evidence suggests that the chapel may originally have been a chantry dedicated to St Nicholas. The roundel windows in the north wall date from the 13th century and are the oldest glass in Berkshire.|$|E

Nesfield in the 19th century. On the estate are cottages designed by Nesfield's son, William Eden Nesfield, which Pevsner considered to have introduced features such as tile hanging and pargetting into Cheshire.

5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Mike Phelan, and also in the hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued, {{and by the}} late 1860s gossip regarding their affair had spread about London, where they were regularly seen spending time together. Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy {{argued that it was}} likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronie, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, although {{there is no evidence that}} they had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris's {{relationship with}} his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife and children to visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, <b>Webb,</b> <b>and</b> Taylor toured the churches of northern France.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, Young was {{nominated}} {{as a candidate}} for the All-Star Final Vote, contending against Tom Gorzelanny, Roy Oswalt, Brandon <b>Webb</b> <b>and</b> Carlos Zambrano. In a bid for the final spot on July 4, Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 1–0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead, but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by a slim margin (1.9968 to 1.9970). The voting ended on July 5, with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All-Star Game selection. The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All-Star team (joining Lou Gehrig, Red Rolfe, Ron Darling, Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger).|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 2013, Webb {{announced}} that Hans Zimmer would be composing {{the music for}} the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film.

Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart {{did not participate in}} the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting Zimmer. The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans Zimmer described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first heard on the website.|$|E
