500|$|Japan's {{sentiment}} regarding {{indigenous peoples}} was crafted around {{the memory of}} the Mudan Incident, when, in 1871, a group of 54 shipwrecked Ryūkyūan sailors was massacred by a Paiwan group from the village of Mudan in southern Taiwan. The resulting Japanese policy, published twenty years before the onset of their rule on Taiwan, cast Taiwanese aborigines as [...] "vicious, violent and cruel" [...] and concluded [...] "this is a pitfall of the world; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of them all". Japanese campaigns to gain aboriginal submission were often brutal, as evidenced in the desire of Japan's first Governor General, Kabayama Sukenori, to [...] "...conquer the barbarians" [...] The Seediq Aboriginals fought against the Japanese in multiple battles such as the Xincheng incident (新城事件), Truku battle (太魯閣之役) (Taroko), 1902 Renzhiguan incident (人止關事件), and the 1903 Zimeiyuan incident 姊妹原事件. In the Wushe Incident of 1930, for example, a Seediq group was decimated by artillery and supplanted by the Taroko (Truku), which had sustained periods of bombardment from naval ships and airplanes dropping mustard gas. A quarantine was placed around the mountain areas enforced by armed guard stations and electrified fences until the most remote high mountain villages could be relocated closer to administrative control.|$|E

500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E

2500|$|The outrage in the North {{was loud}} and strong. Thousands {{attended}} rallies {{in support of}} Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. [...] More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, Ralph Waldo Emerson described the divide the incident represented: [...] "I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. [...] I think <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of slavery, or <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of freedom." [...] Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The Richmond Enquirer editorialized that Sumner should be caned [...] "every morning," [...] praising the attack as [...] "good in conception, better in execution, {{and best of all}} in consequences" [...] and denounced [...] "these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate" [...] who [...] "have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission." [...] Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. [...] One was inscribed [...] "Hit him again." [...] Southern lawmakers made rings out of the cane's remains, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks.|$|E

2500|$|Emerson did {{not become}} an ardent {{abolitionist}} until 1844, though his journals show he was concerned with slavery beginning in his youth, even dreaming about helping to free slaves. In June 1856, shortly after Charles Sumner, a United States Senator, was beaten for his staunch abolitionist views, Emerson lamented that he himself was not as committed to the cause. He wrote, [...] "There are men who {{as soon as they}} are born take a bee-line to the axe of the inquisitor[...] [...] [...] Wonderful {{the way in which we}} are saved by this unfailing supply of the moral element". After Sumner's attack, Emerson began to speak out about slavery. [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of slavery, or <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of freedom", he said at a meeting at Concord that summer. Emerson used slavery as an example of a human injustice, especially in his role as a minister. In early 1838, provoked by the murder of an abolitionist publisher from Alton, Illinois named Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Emerson gave his first public antislavery address. As he said, [...] "It is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live". John Quincy Adams said the mob-murder of Lovejoy [...] "sent a shock as of any earthquake throughout this continent". However, Emerson maintained that reform would be achieved through moral agreement rather than by militant action. By August 1, 1844, at a lecture in Concord, he stated more clearly his support for the abolitionist movement: [...] "We are indebted mainly to this movement, and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics".|$|E

2500|$|He {{argued that}} {{there was no point in}} {{claiming}} rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. [...] " [...] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day—it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|After huge {{losses in}} the team roster and point guard shortage, Lithuania started the tournament with a loss to Turkey (76–84). This {{was the first time}} in the 21st century that the Lithuanians began a {{championship}} with a defeat. Later Lithuanians disappointingly lost to Poland, and depended on a strong fourth quarter [...] to beat Bulgaria. Finishing third in its group, Lithuania qualified for the second round. However, it already begun badly with a 23-point loss to Slovenia. Following this shocking loss, team's captain Robertas Javtokas, when asked about the team's future, said: [...] "I don't know what else we could promise. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> straight or it is enough of promises. We must come as men with balls and not like kids. Otherwise, other teams will humiliate us again". The team's game still not improved, with a defeat to Spain (70–84) diminishing the Lithuanians' chances to qualify for the quarter-finals, and a loss to Serbia eliminating the team outright, with the final standing being a measly 12th place. Coach Ramūnas Butautas took all responsibility for the fiasco and resigned. It is regarded as the worst Lithuania national team performance ever.|$|E

We are convinced that thus far the man has told the truth, and if all of his story is found to be true beyond the shadow of a doubt, we can no longer hold him as a suspect." [...] Gonzaullas also stated, [...] "Our duty is not only to apprehend violators of the law, but also to protect innocent persons. When we make an arrest in this case and charges are filed, there must be no mistake. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> the right man or no man at all." [...] On Friday, May 3, the Gazette reported Gonzaullas' announcement that, [...] "This man has been completely eliminated.

His deputy Anzor Astemirov later recalled how Umarov {{told them that}} [...] "of course we must rely on Allah, not on England, not on America, not on the West, not on anyone except Allah, and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> rid of all these delusions." [...] In the video in which Umarov {{claimed responsibility for the}} Domodedovo International Airport bombing, he criticized the United States and Russia as hypocrites, stating that if they actually followed their own principles, they would have to surrender world power to China due to the senior status of Chinese culture. In March 2013, Umarov urged the Chechen diaspora members to not get involved in the Syrian Civil War and instead to join his forces in the North Caucasus. Umarov reversed this position four months later in July, when he called for Chechens to participate in the [...] "jihad" [...] in Syria so they could later use their experience gained in this conflict in a fight against Russia in their native land. The ideology that Umarov espoused from the declaration of the Caucasus Emirate until his death would describe him as a Salafist-Takfiri jihadist.|$|E
