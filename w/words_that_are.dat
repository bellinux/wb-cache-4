5|$|Perl {{poetry is}} the {{practice}} of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as Black Perl. Perl poetry is {{made possible by the}} large number of English <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used in the Perl language. New poems are regularly submitted to the community at PerlMonks.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E

5|$|The Negombo Tamil dialect {{is used by}} bilingual {{fishermen}} in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala. The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, {{while at the same}} time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old Tamil around 9th century CE. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{languages}} of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to {{speculation about the}} origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Old Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others, the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> classifiers today started out as full nouns; in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so that they are now used only as classifiers.|$|E

5000|$|The fifth episode, {{originally}} {{named the}} After Piece, later renamed Hold Your Hold!, brings the audience {{up to the}} present day. From 1938 through 1944, the Interlocutor introduced the piece by proclaiming the current year. Three women, speaking as [...] "three million women" [...] intone a [...] "lament for the living." [...] One man, a surrogate for [...] "one million men," [...] voices his hopes and fears. A Dance of Invocation brings the performance to a climax as the Interlocutor speaks, [...] "America! Name me the <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> courage. America! Name me the <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> justice. America! Name me the <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> power. America! Name me the <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> freedom. America! Name me the <b>word</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> faith. Here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> - Democracy!" [...] The company exits {{with the exception of the}} Principals, who stand on opposite sides of the stage as the Interlocutor recites the famous words from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address [...] "That government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth." [...] The company enters in a final walk-around. The Interlocutor bids the audience goodnight.|$|R
5000|$|The pitch accents (as {{well as the}} {{peculiar}} phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a [...] "singing" [...] quality which makes it fairly easy to distinguish from other languages. Interestingly, accent 1 generally occurs in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> monosyllabic in Old Norse, and accent 2 in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> polysyllabic.|$|R

25|$|<b>Words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> never {{subject to}} {{inflection}} {{are said to}} be invariant; for example, the English verb must is an invariant item: it never takes a suffix or changes form to signify a different grammatical category. Its categories can be determined only from its context.|$|E

25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> spoken. Many different ways that {{attention is focused}} on hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or in the use of <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{history of}} the Torres Strait area is complex, and interaction of well over 2000 years has led to many layers of relationship between the local languages, including many <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> obviously common, though whether through trade or 'genetics' is another story, {{such as the following}} 'trade' words in Torres Strait area languages.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Romanian language, a Romance language, {{can be traced back}} to the Roman {{colonisation}} of the region. The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin, although there are some substratum <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> sometimes assumed to be of Dacian origin. Romanian language has retained the inflected structure of Latin grammar.|$|E
25|$|Infants now combine {{different}} vowels and consonants into syllable strings. At this stage, infants {{also produce}} various stress and intonation patterns. During this transitional period from babbling {{to the first}} word children also produce “protowords”, i.e., invented <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used consistently to express specific meanings, but that are not real words in the children’s target language. Around 12–14 months of age children produce their first word.|$|E

All species of the genus Senecio contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (e.g., senecionine) a substance that when a human has chronic exposure can cause irreversible liver damage.|$|E
