5|$|In Toronto, {{engineers}} and surveyors were examining the four-lane bypass, while planners set about designing a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the commuter highway. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway401 in Toronto {{from four to}} a minimum of 12lanes between Islington Avenue and Markham Road. The design {{was taken from the}} Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago, which was widened into a similar configuration around the same time. Construction began immediately. While the plan initially called for construction to end in 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were always open during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway27, Highway400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. The system was completed in 1972, along with the Highway27 (renamed Highway427) bypass between the QEW and Pearson Airport. Most of the interchanges in Toronto were reconstructed as partial cloverleafs and a continuous lighting system was installed.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the last}} decade of the 20th century, some US policy makers and {{academics}} projected that the electrical power industry would ultimately experience deregulation and independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) were established. They were conceived as the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the vastly increased number of transactions that take place in a competitive environment. About a dozen states decided to deregulate but some pulled back following the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001.|$|E
25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) was {{established}} by Louis B. Mayer, originator of Louis B.

Mayer's purpose in creating the award was to unite the five branches of the film industry, including actors, directors, producers, technicians, and writers. Mayer commented {{on the creation of}} the awards [...] "I found that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> [...] was to hang medals all over them ... If I got them cups and awards they'd kill them to produce what I wanted. That's why the Academy Award was created". Mayer asked Cedric Gibbons, art director of MGM, to design an Academy Award trophy. Nominees were notified through a telegram in February 1928. In August 1928, Mayer contacted the Academy Central Board of Judges to decide winners. However, according to the American director King Vidor, the voting for the Academy Award for Best Picture was {{in the hands of the}} AMPAS founders Douglas Fairbanks, Sid Grauman, Mayer, Mary Pickford, and Joseph Schenck.|$|E
500|$|The Angry Whopper has jalapeños, [...] "Angry Sauce" [...] and [...] "Angry Onions", pepper {{jack cheese}} and bacon.

The new variant added a red bun with hot pepper sauce baked into the roll. The Angriest Whopper followed a similar sandwich, the A1 Halloween Whopper released for Halloween 2015, which was prepared with black-colored, smoke-flavored buns, which caused fecal discoloration in some consumers. The Angry Whopper was released with a viral marketing push created by Burger King's advertising agency at the time, Crispin Porter + Bogusky. The two tiered program, designed to create a word-of-mouth marketing push, featured a webpage that allowed consumers to create an [...] "Angry-gram" [...] that could be emailed to other individuals. The form letter format page would send an insulting email to a recipient of choice from the sender. The second part consisted of a Facebook-oriented program where the company would issue a coupon for a free sandwich if the consumer would de-friend 10 people on their Facebook page. The Angriest Whopper was pitched using advertising similar to trailers for movie sequels, with a movie trailer-style opening screen, shots of lava, a helicopter and flames.
