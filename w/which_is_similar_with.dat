50|$|Superlattice miniband {{structures}} {{depend on}} the heterostructure type, either type I, type II or type III. For type I {{the bottom of the}} conduction band and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer. In type II the conduction and valence subbands are staggered in both real and reciprocal space, so that electrons and holes are confined in different layers. Type III superlattices involve semimetal material, such as HgTe/CdTe. Although the bottom of the conduction subband and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer in Type III superlattice, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> Type I superlattice, the band gap of Type III superlattices can be continuously adjusted from semiconductor to zero band gap material and to semimetal with negative band gap.|$|E
5000|$|One {{specific}} type of debitage analysis is mass analysis. Mass analysis is based on analyzing debitage populations based on their size distribution across specified size grades. Ahler (1989) conducted an experimental replication under some technological settings and classified debitage into five groups according to their size, Discriminant analysis (by SPSS DISCRIMINANT function) was applied to compare mass analysis data sets for these five experimental data groups. He then compared the counts and weights of experimental samples with debris from two prehistoric workshop sites in western North Dakota. The result shows the experimental data sets can explain the technological composition of archaeological samples. Samples from several other sites also are applied this method and derive clear discriminant results. Especially in a specific function site, such as Legacy site a Late Woodland age camp in the Missouri breaks, associated with bison kill/butchering, the low frequency of cortex and a specific flake ratio (G4:Gl-3 [...] ) data indicate that a soft hammer small flake tool production, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> experiment result. Although this process {{has been used in}} many studies, Andrefsky warns of the potential problems associated with the many assumptions made while employing this analysis. One in particular that he draws attention to is the possibility of differences in debitage populations based on individual variation of the artifact maker; in his example, three different knappers all using bipolar core reduction have different percentages of size grade 3 debitage (5.2%, 13.2%, and 10.2%). These differences indicate that individual variation can be influential in the size distribution of debitage and should be kept in mind if mass analysis is being employed. The reason for which Andrefsky believes mass analysis have become so popular is due to the process's ease of use and speed. Andrefsky even quotes Ahler that between individual specimen analysis and mass analysis, mass analysis has the advantage because of four reasons: 1) biases are eliminated because mass analysis looks at the entire assemblage; both completed and fractured. 2) Because mass analysis doesn't require looking at each artifact, it is very rapid and efficient. 3) debitage biases based on the sample's size are reduced since it merely captures different specimen sizes. 4) the method is highly objective and can be trained by virtually anyone.|$|E

This research has three objectives: 1) to describe the types of the wordplay, 2) to describe the techniques used by translator to translate the wordplay, and 3) to describe the degree of equivalence of the translation of the wordplay in SpongeBob movies. This research employed descriptive qualitative method as the main method because this research was concerned with the narrative descriptive of the translation phenomena in SpongeBob movies. The forms of data of this research were words and phrases containing wordplay in the movies. They were collected manually from the original VCDs of SpongeBob movies: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water and their Bahasa Indonesia subtitle. The main instrument was the researcher who acted as data collector, data analyst and data interpreter. The trustworthiness {{of this study was}} achieved by using a triangulation technique. 	The findings of this research show that six types of wordplay are found. They are homonymy, homography, paronymy, idiom, syntactic structure and morphological development. Among them, morphological development is in the highest number. Then, the techniques used by translator to translate the wordplay are wordplay to wordplay, wordplay to non-wordplay, wordplay to zero, wordplay in the target text <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> the source text, and multiple techniques: editorial and wordplay in the target text <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> the source text technique.
