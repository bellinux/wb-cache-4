The results of this sleuthing often find their way to the 9/11 families, and in particular, to the by now mythic Jersey Girls, as the leaders of the survivors' families have come to be called. The researchers are in many ways similar to the team Scott Armstrong, the former Washington Post reporter, recruited in the mid 1980s to uncover the roots of Reagan's secret Iran-Contra deals. ... At the hub of the 9-11 research is Paul Thompson's intricate timeline. ... Still other timelines delve into official 'lies' from 1979 forward. ... Derek Mitchell's aim is to keep the entries as neutrally written and as well sourced as he can." [...] In his 2005 book, The Five Unanswered Questions of 9/11, Ridgeway referred to Thompson's book, The Terror Timeline, as [...] "still the most comprehensive summary of the events related to the 9/11 attacks."

40|$|Barack Obama {{came into}} office {{promising}} a major departure from the policies of his predecessor regarding the so-called Global War on Terror. This paper compares {{the policies of the}} Bush and Obama administrations on four issues: 1) treatment of prisoners, particularly indefinite detention at Guantánamo Bay and trial by military commissions; 2) kidnapping, “extraordinary rendition,” and torture of terrorist suspects; 3) targeted killings by unpiloted aerial vehicles or “drones;” and 4) preventive wars and “humanitarian interventions. ” It considers four main indicators of change: 1) whether the Obama administration continued existing policies or stopped them; 2) whether it publicly stigmatized illegal practices or remained silent; 3) whether or not it investigated crimes of Bush officials and punished the perpetrators; and 4) whether the Obama administration expanded the practices of its predecessors. The fourth indicator is most relevant to the topic of drone attacks, where the administration extended the practice of targeting killing by drones in number, frequency, space, and by category of target beyond <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration did.

40|$|The {{relations}} between the United States and its traditional ally, Venezuela, experienced {{a turn for the}} worse during the presidency of George W. <b>Bush.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> administration reacted to the radical president Hugo Chavez with an increase in funding of the so-called democracy promotion in Venezuela and with a silent support of the unsuccessful coup in 2002. The long history of U. S. interventions in Latin America during the cold war gives ground to the criticism by many authors who see these steps as an attempt to get rid of a democratically elected president just because he is confronting the American vision about a political and economic system desirable for the region. This work focuses on democracy promotion as a tool of the U. S. foreign policy, which is on one hand related to the identity of the United States as a unique historical democratic experiment, but also reacts to a threat posed to the national interests by other states. It deals with the types of threats that Hugo Chavez could have possibly presented, and thus shows to <b>what</b> extent <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration used democracy promotion in a pragmatic way.

40|$|As {{the culture}} and society of the United States is being {{transformed}} with an influx of Latino immigration and the entrenchment of traditional Latin American migration sources, {{we are left with}} many unanswered questions regarding the course of American Politics. Foremost among them, and neglected to this point, are the impacts of a greater Latino population on America's external foreign relations. Samuel Huntington (2004) holds that the proliferation of Latinos will degrade the traditional national interest of America and thus harm the state's national security. The realities of Latino preferences have been completely unexplored and we have been left with snap judgments about the complex preference formations among the Latino population. It is important that we understand Latino preferences as a whole; especially in light of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Doctrine, which shapes American military commitments after 9 / 11. <b>What</b> preferences does <b>the</b> Latino population hold for U. S. combat operations? Do Latinos express the traditional foreign policy preferences of other American groups or is a new multicultural path emerging? The final important question regards <b>what</b> impact <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Doctrine will have on Latin American-U. S. relations. This article finds strong Latino support for typical U. S. foreign policies and high levels of patriotism exhibited by the population, suggesting that Latinos will support the national interest of the United States.

40|$|This {{review of}} Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency argues that Posner 2 ̆ 7 s {{particular}} brand of pragmatic utilitarianism is particularly ill-suited to constitutional interpretation, {{as it seems}} to negate the very idea of precommitment that is so essential to constitutionalism. Instead, Posner treats the Constitution as little more than an invitation to pragmatic policy judgment, and then employs that judgment through speculative cost-benefit balancing to find constitutionally unobjectionable most of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration has done thus far in the war on terror, including coercive interrogation, incommunicado detention, warrantless wiretapping, and ethnic profiling. Indeed, Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution would permit the Administration to go much further than it has - among other things, he defends indefinite preventive detention, banning Islamic extremist rhetoric, mass wiretapping of the entire nation, and making it a crime for newspapers to publish classified information. All of this is permissible, Posner argues, because unless the Constitution bend[s] in the face of threats to our national security, it will break. Ironically, Posner reaches these results with a constitutional theory more in keeping with Chief Justice Earl Warren than Justice Antonin Scalia. Eschewing popular conservative attacks on judicial activism, Posner argues that given the open-ended character of many of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s most important terms, it is not objectionable, but inevitable, that constitutional law is judge-made. He dismisses the constitutional theories of textualism and originalism favored by many conservative judges and scholars as canards. But having rejected textualism and originalism, Posner proceeds unwittingly to offer a book-length demonstration of what textualists and originalists most fear from constitutional theorists who emphasize the document 2 ̆ 7 s open-ended and evolving character. In Posner 2 ̆ 7 s approach, the Constitution loses almost any sense of a binding precommitment, and is reduced to a cover for judges to impose their own subjective value judgments on others. The review first discusses Posner 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of several specific security-liberty issues, in order to illustrate how his method works in concrete scenarios. I then turn to the broader implications his theory has for constitutional law, which in my view are quite dangerous...|$|E
