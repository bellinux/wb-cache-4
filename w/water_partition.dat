40|$|In {{regions of}} the mantle where water is a trace species in the {{nominally}} anhydrous minerals (rather than a free vapor phase or a hydrous mineral), melting is controlled by <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> into melt and the resulting freezing-point depression. Modeling undersaturated melting therefore requires a well-constrained formalism for the bulk partition coefficient (D_(H_ 2 O)) and its variations, {{as well as an}} accurate model for hydrous melt-mineral equilibria. Hirth and Kohlstedt [1] developed a <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> model that leads to a solely pressure-dependent D_(H_ 2 O). Their model expresses the solubility of H_ 2 O in minerals and melts {{as a function of the}} standard state f°_(H_ 2 O) (linear for minerals, square root for melts). In the absence of data on undersaturated systems, they assume Henry's law, such that D_(H_ 2 O) is the ratio of solubilities, at any water content. Thermodynamically, however, one expects a square root dependence of H_ 2 O content in the melt on the actual water fugacity (f°_(H_ 2 O) = a_(H_ 2 O) f°_(H_ 2 O)). This implies that D_(H_ 2 O) decreases with decreasing water content as a^(1 / 2) H_ 2 O, approaching zero as the system dries out. The coupling of this partitioning model to pMELTS is the basis of one approach to damp mantle melting [2]. The prediction of a concentration-dependent D_(H_ 2 O) has some important but difficult-to-observe consequences (e. g., the removal of H_ 2 O from the residue would be an accelerating process, leading to a more abrupt viscosity transition) but also makes the direct prediction that water should behave more compatibly in more-water rich systems. There has been considerable argument as to which is the most appropriate analogue trace element for <b>water</b> <b>partitioning.</b> Estimates have ranged from (as incompatible as) La in depleted MORB to (as compatible as) Nd in BABB [3], though Ce is presently a popular choice [4]. This variation can be a natural and systematic consequence of partitioning rather than a complex combination of source and process effects, and is due to the non-Henrian behavior of water in the melt rather than a pressure dependence. Direct mineral-melt <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> data from undersaturated experiments are needed to test this prediction...|$|R

Thus, in this study, an attempt was made to perform scheme-based model optimization by designing a framework for coupling a micro-genetic algorithm (micro-GA) with the Noah land surface model that has multiple physics options (Noah-MP). Micro-GA controls the scheme selections in 10 different land surface parameterization fields in Noah-MP in order to extract the optimal scheme combination for a certain region.

We also acknowledge NERC PhD studentship support to Sargeant and Evans. Seasonal and annual <b>partitioning</b> of <b>water</b> within river floodplains {{has important implications}} for ecohydrologic links between the water cycle and tree growth. Climatic and hydrologic shifts alter water distribution between floodplain storage reservoirs (e. g., vadose, phreatic), affecting water availability to tree roots. <b>Water</b> <b>partitioning</b> is also dependent on the physical conditions that control tree rooting depth (e. g., gravel layers that impede root growth), the sources of contributing water, the rate of water drainage, and water residence times within particular storage reservoirs. We employ instrumental climate records alongside oxygen isotopes within tree rings and regional source waters, as well as topographic data and soil depth measurements, to infer the water sources used over several decades by two co-occurring tree species within a riparian floodplain along the Rhône River in France. We find that <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> to riparian trees is influenced by annual (wet versus dry years) and seasonal (spring snowmelt versus spring rainfall) fluctuations in climate. This influence depends strongly on local (tree level) conditions including floodplain surface elevation and subsurface gravel layer elevation. The latter represents the upper limit of the phreatic zone and therefore controls access to shallow groundwater. The difference between them, the thickness of the vadose zone, controls total soil moisture retention capacity. These factors thus modulate the climatic influence on tree ring isotopes. Additionally, we identified growth signatures and tree ring isotope changes associated with recent restoration of minimum streamflows in the Rhône, which made new phreatic water sources available to some trees in otherwise dry years.

40|$|The {{importance}} of aquatic food chain bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in contributing to human dose is derived. It is shown that for chemicals with log octanol <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> coefficients greater than about 3, {{the role of}} food chain transfer to fish consumed by humans becomes the more dominant route over drinking water. Modeling of aquatic food chain bioaccumulation then becomes necessary to accurately estimate dose of such chemicals to humans. The relevant time and space scales for groundwater and surface water also indicate a division of organic chemicals at a log octanol <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> coefficient of about 3. For chemicals greater than that level, groundwater transport is minimal, while for chemicals with log octanol water coefficients of less than about 3, detention times are long relative to surface water and biodegradation processes become more significant.

40|$|Large {{terrestrial}} {{planets are}} expected to have muted topography and deep oceans, implying that most super-Earths should be entirely covered in water, so-called waterworlds. This is important because waterworlds lack a silicate weathering thermostat so their climate is predicted to be less stable than that of planets with exposed continents. In other words, the continuously habitable zone for waterworlds is much narrower than for Earth-like planets. A planet's <b>water</b> is <b>partitioned,</b> however, between a surface reservoir, the ocean, and an interior reservoir, the mantle. Plate tectonics transports water between these reservoirs on geological timescales. Degassing of melt at mid-ocean ridges and serpentinization of oceanic crust depend negatively and positively on seafloor pressure, respectively, providing a stabilizing feedback on long-term ocean volume. Motivated by Earth's approximately steady-state deep water cycle, we develop a two-box model of the hydrosphere and derive steady-state solutions to the <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> on terrestrial planets. Critically, hydrostatic seafloor pressure is proportional to surface gravity, so super-Earths with a deep water cycle will tend to store more water in the mantle. We conclude that a tectonically active terrestrial planet of any mass can maintain exposed continents if its water mass fraction is less than ~ 0. 2 %, dramatically increasing the odds that super-Earths are habitable. The greatest source of uncertainty in our study is Earth's current mantle water inventory: the greater its value, the more robust planets are to inundation. Lastly, we discuss how future missions can test our hypothesis by mapping the oceans and continents of massive terrestrial planets. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, ApJ in pres...|$|R
