The zones differ in terms of climate and examples of what is regulated by wine growing zone are required grape maturity at harvest and allowed levels of chaptalisation. There are 21 wine producing countries in the European Union, with 14 of them having significant levels of production. In the 2004-2005 vintage, total European Union wine production was around 184 million hectoliters (4.8 billion gallons) which accounted for nearly 70% of total worldwide production. Of that total, nearly 55% was classified as table wine with 4% used in the production of grape-based distilled spirits such as Armagnac and Cognac.|$|E

Baden - Germany's southernmost, warmest and sunniest {{wine-growing}} region, in Germany's southwestern corner, across river Rhine from Alsace, and {{the only}} German wine region situated in European Union <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> <b>zone</b> B rather than A, which results in higher minimum required maturity of grapes and less chaptalisation allowed.

50|$|Baden is Germany's longest wine region, {{approximately}} 400 km (250miles) {{and reaching}} {{from the border}} of Franken in the north to Lake Constance in the south, and is primarily situated on the eastern bank of river Rhine.Much of Baden is situated in the Rhine rift, which is protected by the Black Forest and the Vosges mountains {{to the west of}} Rhine, and is therefore Germany's warmest location. Therefore, its wines are usually more full-bodied and higher in alcohol than wines from other German regions, and it is the only German wine region situated in European Union <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> <b>zone</b> B rather than A. On the other side of Rhine from Baden, Alsace is situated.|$|R

With the help of investors from the world of wine (European and Brazilian) to develop a fine wine (unlike table wines derived from Vitis labrusca) which combines the advanced technical itineraries, from the vineyard to the cellar. This wine will have to represent all the progress environmental terms and social, to promote effective marketing in the wine main importing countries (United States, Germany, Benelux) and on the local market. To do this, localize the best terroir of wine point of view taking into consideration sustainable human development. In a first part, after observing the economic benefits of implementing a vineyard in Brazil, the objective of this study will define the area more favorable to the type of wine to produce. This analysis will be based of meteorological data.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) My {{starting}} point for this thesis was {{the absence of a}} foundation history of Australian <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> conducted by an historian rather than researchers in other disciplines or the media. I have used existing work on wine history in New South Wales from 1788 to 1901 alongside a significant body of new research to create an historical argument suitable for incorporation into more broadly-themed narratives of Australian history and to inform studies of <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in other academic fields. My main argument is that although <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> proved of little economic value in colonial primary production compared with nation-building commodities - such as pastoralism, wheat growing and gold - advocates of the cultivation of wine grapes believed <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> embodied beneficial, even transformative, cultural value so they persisted in attempting to create a ‘civilizing’ industry producing a ‘civilized’ drink despite lacklustre consumption of their product and very modest profits. Several times, from 1788 to 1901, these advocates spoke out or wrote about <b>wine</b> and <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> as capable of creating order in a wild or ‘savage’ landscape and within a settler society shaped culturally by shifting adaptations to both imported and ‘native’ influences in agriculture as well as alcohol production, consumption and distribution. While the methodological framework employed here falls mainly within cultural and economic history, sociological theories have contributed to findings on causation. The result is a comprehensive narrative of colonial <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in New South Wales enriched by links to key developments in Australian colonial history and with reference to <b>wine</b> <b>growing</b> in other British colonies or former territories...|$|R
