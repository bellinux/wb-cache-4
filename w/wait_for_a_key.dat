We believe these points to be relevant to the current status of the National Health Service (NHS), which is facing an ever growing demand for its services, leading to increasing waiting times as a result. Across NHS England, 838, 600 patients were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> diagnostic test at the end of November 2015, a 5. 6 % increase from November 2014. Waiting times have been associated with lower patient satisfaction and reduced clinical outcomes. It is therefore crucial that management teams take an active approach to reducing waiting times.    View the original paper by Zaghloul and El Enei...|$|R
5000|$|Display {{was over}} an RF {{connection}} to a household television, and simple offline program storage was possible using a cassette recorder. The video display generator of the ZX80 used minimal hardware plus a combination of software to generate a video signal. This was an idea that was popularised by Don Lancaster in his 1978 book The TV Cheap Video Cookbook and his [...] "TV Typewriter". As {{a result of this}} approach the ZX80 could only generate a picture when it was idle, i.e. <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to be pressed. When running a BASIC program, or even when pressing <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> any input, the display would, therefore, blank out momentarily while the processor was busy. This made moving graphics difficult since the program had to introduce <b>a</b> pause <b>for</b> input to display the next change in graphical output. The later ZX81 improved on this somewhat because it could run in a [...] "slow" [...] mode while creating a video signal, or in a [...] "fast" [...] mode without generating a video signal (typically used for lengthy calculations). Another issue was that the main RAM was used to store the screen display, with the result that the available screen size would gradually decrease as the size of a program increased (and vice versa); with 1 KB RAM, running a 990 byte program would result in only one row of characters being visible on the screen; a full screen (32×24) would leave only 384 bytes to the programmer.|$|R
50|$|DICE {{stated in}} a post, {{that they would}} be handing out extra closed-beta keys for the first 20 {{comments}} on their new posts. This was posted on the official Battlefield Heroes website on 31 July 2008. It was revealed that the first of these posts would be made on 4 August 2008. This caused so many users to be on the Battlefield Heroes website at the same time <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beta <b>key,</b> that it caused the Battlefield Heroes server to crash, delaying the release of the keys until maintenance could be completed. Two days later on 6 August, the method was changed so that users had to solve a riddle to win <b>a</b> beta <b>key</b> (although the first 20 comments were still awarded beta keys on this occasion, since it was not made clear that the format had changed).|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{explore the}} {{perceptions}} of caring and expectations of nursing care in patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list. Background. The <b>waiting</b> period <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heart or lung transplant can be very stressful and demanding for patients and their families. Care during the waiting period needs to be aimed at treating the symptoms and complications of patients’ underlying condition and also specific issues related to organ transplant candidacy. Method. A qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with 22 patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list was used. Participants were interviewed on three separate occasions. Findings. Qualitative {{analysis of the data}} revealed five major themes related to the nursing care needs of heart and lung transplant candidates. The themes were identified as information giving, maintenance of regular contact, familiarity, positive thinking and compassionate manner. These were five key aspects of communication within the nurse–patient relationship and formed the essence of caring as perceived by patients awaiting heart and/or lung transplantation. Conclusion. Transplant candidates often experience prolonged <b>waiting</b> times <b>for</b> <b>a</b> transplant which is often laden with uncertainties and stress. This study provided an in-depth description of patients’ perceptions of caring and their nursing care needs whilst on a heart and lung transplant waiting list. Relevance to clinical practice. The findings provide useful advice to nurses about ways they can improve care and enhance caring <b>for</b> patients <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> organ transplant. <b>Key</b> elements of nursing care that foster the nurse–patient relationship that can be incorporated into nursing care pathways have been highlighted...|$|R
40|$|With {{miniature}} {{mass spectrometry}} high performance chemical analysis becomes {{available to the}} broader community. In areas of defense, law enforcement, pharmaceutical science, and research industries such portable instrumentation begins to fill technology gaps, increase safety and efficiency, decrease sample preparation time, and decrease lead time <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> results. <b>A</b> <b>key</b> technology facilitating miniature mass spectrometry is the ion trap mass analyzer. In this thesis miniature ion traps have demonstrated lower RF voltage, lower power, increased mass range, smaller form factor, ion trap and circuit integration, increased trapping capacity through arrays, the use of wideband power amplifiers, and amenability to planar and other alternative fabrication strategies {{all of which can}} significantly reduce device size and cost. ^ Several obstacles associated with the miniaturization process have been investigated through simulation and experiment in order to mitigate their effects. First, limitations of precision machining at very small dimensions are overcome by advanced fabrication through stereolithography. Second, the large space requirement of bulky interconnects and assembly hardware is reduced through assembly-free integration of circuit board and stereolithography. Third, ion trap arrays are used to compensate for the loss of ion trapping capacity per element, thereby increasing dynamic range. Fourth, the array effect, caused by dimensional variance between array elements, is characterized and overcome by tuning at each element. Fifth, the effects of perturbations are analyzed through simulation and characterization of a ceramic ion trap. Sixth, the increased effects of nonlinear resonances caused by higher order multipoles in miniature traps are analyzed through corroboration of simulation and experiment. Seventh, limitations on scaling are described on account of collisional cooling and decreased spectral resolution. ^ New methods are introduced for ion trap fabrication, based on the fabrication method stereolithography. One rapid methodology combines 2 D and 3 D parallel processing techniques to create miniature ion traps and arrays as single contiguous units while requiring no hand assembly. This process allows the array to be designed with freedom for tuning at each element. A second extends the use of stereolithography to the fabrication of a ceramic ion trap. ^ The development of an ion trajectory simulator with a collision model has been invaluable for the characterization of events observed in miniature traps. The trajectory simulator illustrates the minimum ion cloud size under typical operating parameters, and accurately predicts the resonance ejection patterns of miniature nonlinear ion traps. It has been shown that mass range, buffer gas temperature and type, and ion trap dimensions have an increased impact on performance with the decreased scale of the ion trap. ^ The reduced scale ion trap and circuit board integration have led to the design of a small integrated ion trap vacuum chamber. With this configuration low voltage waveforms are passed through circuit board into a small polymer vacuum chamber form fit to the miniature ion trap. A power operational amplifier permits operation at 1 MHz <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mass range of over 1000 m/z in a miniature trap. Finally, the future of miniature mass spectrometry is proposed by combining the ion trap vacuum chamber with the power amplifier on a single substrate to decrease the size and cost of mass spectrometers while maintaining high quality performance expected of lab based equipment. ...|$|R
