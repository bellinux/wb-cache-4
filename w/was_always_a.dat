5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century. The stone spire, from 1230, {{is one of the oldest}} in England and contributes to Oxford’s tradition as “the city of dreaming spires”. Its most unusual feature is the late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman chancel.|$|E
5|$|Peterborough {{sent two}} members to {{parliament}} {{for the first}} time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were relatives of the clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.|$|E

House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, {{especially in terms of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E

5|$|The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was a {{seasonal}} association football competition contested between member associations of European football's governing body, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). It {{was open to}} winners of domestic cup winners, such as the English FA Cup champions. Throughout its 39-year history, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> knock-out tournament with two-legged home and away ties until the single match final staged at a neutral venue, the only exception to this being the two-legged final in the competition's first year. The first competition was won by Fiorentina, from Italy, who defeated Scotland's Rangers 4–1 over two legs to win the 1961 final. The competition was abolished in 1999; Italian team Lazio were the last team to win the competition when they beat Mallorca 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} lord {{was taken}} back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual. The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region. After this, Quiriguá engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of Copán, possibly using captured Copán sculptors {{to carry out the}} work. The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quiriguá <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

5|$|There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and Governor Foraker {{suggested}} President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and {{his professional}} goal <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> {{seat on the}} Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it. Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States. When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate the backlog, while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> small company, {{employing}} about 400 {{people in}} 1968, {{and in the}} 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland.

The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models; for 116 lorry models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E

In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.|$|E

5|$|Alfa Ba, Karamoko Alfa's father, {{formed a}} {{coalition}} of Muslim Fulbe and called for the jihad in 1725, but died before the struggle began. The jihad was launched around 1726-1727. After a crucial, concluding victory at Talansan, the state was established {{at a meeting of}} nine Fulbe ulama who each represented one of the Futa Jallon provinces. Ibrahima Sambeghu, who became known as Karamokho Alfa, was the hereditary ruler of Timbo and one of the nine ulama. He was elected leader of the jihad. Under his leadership, Futa Jallon became the first Muslim state to be founded by the Fulbe. Despite this, Karamokho Alfa was constrained by the other eight ulama. Some of the other Ulama had more secular power than Karamokho Alfa, who directly ruled only the diwal of Timbo; for this reason the new state <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> tenuous confederation. Karamoko Alfa ruled the theocratic state until 1748, when his excessive devotions caused him to become mentally unstable and Sori was selected as de facto leader. Karamokho Alfa died around 1751 and was formally succeeded by Ibrahim Sori, his cousin.|$|E
5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
