MAP treatment increased fruit shelf-life by delaying the ripening process. MAP drastically reduced fruit weight loss and increased ascorbic acid content compared to control. Negative correlation was found between fruit weight loss and fruit ascorbic acid content and O 2 concentration within the plastic film and fruit ascorbic acid content. By contrast, there was direct correlation between CO 2 content within MAP and the ascorbic acid content of fruit. Mango fruit wrapped in caliber 2 PE film ensured the longest extension of the ripening period, without incurring fruit skin lesions.

When fruit are exposed to temperatures below 5 – 6 °C chilling injury appears as pitting of the skin, browning of the white segments separating the arils and discoloration of the arils, and husk scald, which generally is more severe at temperatures of 6 – 10 °C. The main objective of this work {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of individual film packaging, applied as a stand alone treatment or in combination with fludioxonil, on reducing the occurrence of husk scald, weight loss and decay. Fruit were dipped in an aqueous mixture containing 600 mg L − 1 fludioxonil, wrapped or not wrapped with a polyolephinic heat-shrinkable film and stored at 8 °C and 90 % RH for 6 or 12 weeks plus one additional week of simulated shelf-life at 20 °C and 65 – 70 % RH. Respiration rate decreased both in cold storage and at 20 °C. Ethylene production was not detected during cold storage; its rate increased upon transfer to 20 °C, but results were inconsistent. Control fruit deteriorated at a very high rate, due to excessive weight loss, skin browning and decay. Film wrapping almost completely inhibited weight loss and husk scald and preserved fruit freshness for the whole storage time. There was no statistical difference in decay incidence between wrapped and control fruit after 6 or 12 weeks of storage and after the first shelf-life, while after the second shelf-life, <b>wrapped</b> <b>fruit</b> had significantly higher decay levels. By contrast, fludioxonil, both alone and in combination with wrapping, effectively controlled mold development, resulting in 50 – 67 % less decay than control fruit after 12 weeks at 8 °C plus one week shelf-life.

40|$|Storage of {{individual}} seal-packaged citrus fruit {{at room temperature}} in China is a very common practice that requires a pre-storage treatment with {{a high concentration of}} an effective fungicide as imazalil (IMZ) to prevent decay. In this study, lemons were washed with NaOCl (200 mg L− 1) or not, treated with IMZ (50 or 1000 mg L− 1) at 20 or 50 °C and individually wrapped with a 16 -μm thick extensible polyvinylchloride film (Film A) or two heat shrinkable polyolefinic films, thick 15 (Film B) or 19 -μm (Film C). The sequential treatment with NaOCl and IMZ at 50 mg L− 1 at 50 °C, was as effective as IMZ at 1000 mg L− 1 at 20 °C in controlling Penicillium decay. Losses for decay in fruit wrapped with the two more permeable films (Film A and Film B) never exceeded 10 %, while in those wrapped with Film C (the least permeable) peaked to 41 %. All films reduced weight losses, which at the end of storage were 11 % in fruit wrapped with Film A and below 4 % in those wrapped with the other two films, while were 41 % in unwrapped ones. After one week of storage, only 50 % of unwrapped fruit were marketable whereas all <b>wrapped</b> <b>fruit</b> were still marketable after 8 weeks. Respiration as well as juice acetaldehyde and ethanol were slightly affected by the two more permeable films, while an abnormal production of CO 2, acetaldehyde and ethanol occurred in those wrapped with film C. Changes in chemical parameters were relevant in fruit sealed with Film C and minor in those with Film A and Film B. Decay control and quality preservation of lemons stored at room temperature can be achieved for several weeks by a sequential treatment with NaOCl and a heated water emulsion of IMZ at 50 mg L− 1, when fruit are wrapped with plastic films highly permeable to gases...|$|E

This work aims {{to evaluate}} the postharvest life of two types of sapodilla at ambient temperature and with or without modified atmosphere (PVC film packing). The experiment consisted in storing fruits, harvested at Embrapa´s (Agroindústria Tropical) Experimental Station located in Paraipaba, Ceará, Brazil, under ambient condition (24 ± 2 ºC and 90 ± 5 % U. R), on retail trays where half of these trays was wrapped in PVC and the other half, was not <b>wrapped.</b> <b>Fruits</b> of two types were evaluated for weight loss; pulp firmness; total soluble solids; titrable acidity; pH; total soluble sugars, reducing sugars and starch contents. Fruits stored under MA had less weight loss and greater reduction in pulp firmness when compared to those under AA. Decreases in acidity, soluble solids and total sugar contents and pH were found in both types of fruit during storage under both atmosphere conditions, {{as well as an}} increase in reduced sugars content. The type II fruits, had the longest post-harvest shelf-life...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the shelf life of guava under different post harvest treatments. Qualities of fruits of different varieties decreased with the advancement of storage duration and most were found to lose their marketability at the later stage except Kazi and Swarupkathi. In case of wrapping materials, white and black perforated polythene bags were better in on season for retaining marketability of guava fruits as compared with other treatments. Considering combined effect of variety and <b>wrapping</b> materials, <b>fruits</b> of the Kazi showed the longer duration of marketability among 10 varieties with all treatments. Weight loss of different guava varieties increased with increasing storage duration. Variety Kazi showed the lowest percentage of weight loss. In case of wrapping materials, black and white perforated polythene bags gave minimum weight loss. Based on combined effect of variety and wrapping materials, the variety Kazi showed minimum weight loss among 10 varieties in all wrapping treatments...|$|R
40|$|Wind fruit {{drops in}} {{apples and pears}} occur owing to {{breakage}} of the fruit stalk bases where the inertial forces of the fruits increase by branch movements. In the each cultivar examined, the fruit detachment resistance force perpendicular to the fruit stalk shaft was remarkably smaller than that parallel. Two physical treatments were conducted at about 50 days before each harvest time; jamming a fruit stalk, the shoot and the spur between two convex-adhesive tapes (2 ̆ 7 + 2 ̆ 7 tape), and <b>wrapping</b> a <b>fruit</b> stalk, the shoot {{and a part of}} the spur in a patch of punch carpet and stapling them (punch carpet). In the fruit vibration experiments, the reducing effect of bending angle near the fruit stalk was confirmed in the both treatment of 2 ̆ 7 + 2 ̆ 7 tape and punch carpet. The artificial fruit drop tests using shocks showed significant effects in reducing of detachment rates at fruit stalk base in the both treatments in one variety of apples or pears...|$|R
50|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} citrus industry also stimulated the capital market for real estate. As the industry grew, land {{which had been}} regarded as worthless dramatically increased value. Not only did orange culture feed the land boom of the 1880s in Southern California; it allowed Riverside to survive when the land boom collapsed in 1888. (See also: Panic of 1893.) The success of Tibbets' orange stimulated related industries. Citrus built {{the foundations of the}} region's economic modernization before the great flood of defense funds began in World War II. Tibbets' introduction of the Washington navel orange was largely responsible for the fruit packing houses, inventions in boxing machines, <b>fruit</b> <b>wraps</b> and the iced railroad car.|$|R
40|$|Gialla’ {{cultivar}} (cv) cactus pear fruit {{were either}} exposed {{or not to}} ultraviolet light (UV-C at 254 nm) and packaged or not with a polyolefinic film before cold storage for 1 month at 9 °C plus 1 week of simulated shelf-life conditions at 20 °C (SL). UV exposure did not affect fruit weight loss, while wrapping reduced significantly these losses to 1 / 4 after cold storage and 1 / 10 {{at the end of}} SL, with respect to unpackaged fruit. The overall visual rating of fruit appearance was higher in all the packaged fruit, while those unwrapped were affected by extended skin shrinkage both at the end of storage and SL periods. Skin damage, attributed to chilling injury and UV exposition, resulted higher in unwrapped fruits, in which the onset of these disorders was significantly reduced even when the fruit was UV subjected. Decay percentage was neither reduced by UV exposure nor by wrapping and reached values of about 10 % {{at the end of the}} SL in all cases. Internal quality attributes and fruit taste were neither affected by wrapping nor by UV application. <b>Wrapping</b> the <b>fruit</b> with polyolefinic film had a beneficial effect in preserving fruit freshness and colour brightness, which were lost in unwrapped fruit...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the shelf life and quality as affected by different stages of ripening, storage temperature as well as <b>wrapping</b> materials <b>fruits</b> of guava cv. Kazi. All the studied parameters except marketability increased for a certain storage period and then declined due {{to the effect of}} stages of ripening and wrapping materials (perforated and non perforated white and black polythene bag), while in case of storage temperature, there was gradual increase of physiological weight loss, sugar content (reducing, non-reducing and total sugar) and TSS content. Marketability decreased markedly with the advancement of storage period. All stages of ripening and all wrapping materials were able to keep fruits in marketable condition for 36 days of storage period. But fruits were in better marketable condition when harvested at stage 3 (ripe, yellowish green in colour and crispy pulp) or wrapped with black non-perforated polythene. 5 ºC storage temperature, was able to retain more percentage of fruits in marketable condition with longer storage duration. In case of treatment combinations, fruits harvested at stage 3, stored at 5 ºC temperature with black non-perforated polythene had the highest physiological weight loss, sugar content (reducing, non-reducing and total sugar) and TSS content while stage 1 fruits stored at 20 ºC with no wrapping (control) had the lowest...|$|R
