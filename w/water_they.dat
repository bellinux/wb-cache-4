5|$|E. reichenbachii prefer {{full sun}} and require little <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat tolerant, and grow well under glass. They are drought resistant, but {{susceptible}} to mealybugs and scale insects.|$|E
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds that breed on fresh <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> have lobed toes and are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers. However, {{they have their}} feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.|$|E

5|$|Liquid sugars {{are strong}} syrups {{consisting}} of 67% granulated sugar dissolved in <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> {{are used in}} the food processing {{of a wide range of}} products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|The alkoxides of titanium(IV), {{prepared}} by reacting TiCl4 with alcohols, are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO2 via the sol-gel process. Titanium isopropoxide {{is used in}} the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the Sharpless epoxidation.|$|E
40|$|Demersal fishes {{are those}} fishes which live and feed {{on or near}} the bottom (the {{demersal}} zone) of seas. They occupy the sea floors, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal <b>waters</b> <b>they</b> are found {{on or near the}} continental shelf, and in deep <b>waters</b> <b>they</b> are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. In India, demersal finfishes contribute about 26...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Australian coast, black marlin {{can also be found}} throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> can also be found from Southern California to the Gulf of California to Chile, including the coast of all oceanic islands in between. They tend to stay in warmer waters and hunt the surface. In {{addition to}} warmer <b>waters,</b> <b>they</b> also are found close to land masses as opposed to wide-open water.|$|R
50|$|Adults {{reproduce}} in non flowing <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> build nests {{with leaves}} and roots then one parent guards the nest.|$|R
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} inhabits grassy {{plains and}} slightly forested areas. Due to their regular need of <b>water,</b> <b>they</b> prefer areas where water is perennially available.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> {{can often be}} found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started {{restoring}} two artificial islands. These {{are intended}} to provide safe nesting and roosting sites {{for a range of}} wildfowl. Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads, paths and bird hides are available (for a fee) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol <b>Water.</b> <b>They</b> can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.|$|E
50|$|They are benthopelagic fishes {{found in}} Antarctic <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> are not fished commercially and {{little is known}} about them.|$|R
50|$|Viviparus viviparus {{is largely}} {{confined}} to major, slow-moving, lowland rivers and to lakes and prefers calcareous (base-rich) <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> are {{often found in}} deep water.They are sometimes found in dense clusters (reaching thousands of individuals) on submerged branches and on various man-made objects present under <b>water.</b> More rarely, <b>they</b> are present more scattered in bottom mud, and then are much more discreet. They are also found in canals, artificial ponds, the water behind dams and in reservoirs but usually not in small isolated standing <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> require high oxygen content.|$|R
5000|$|Riversidians {{were known}} for {{harvesting}} clams, quahogs and oysters from the beaches and surrounding <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> {{became known as}} [...] "Clam-diggers".|$|R
5|$|For some Native American tribes, dragonflies {{represent}} swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize pure <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> are {{a common}} motif in Zuni pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in Hopi rock art and on Pueblo necklaces. They {{have been used in}} traditional medicine in Japan and China. In Indonesia, adults are caught on poles made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|Fructose, galactose, and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C6H12O6. They have five {{hydroxyl}} groups (−OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> each exist as several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left.|$|E

5000|$|These crabs {{are most}} common in shallow <b>waters</b> where <b>they</b> live in {{association}} with stony corals, but they have also been recorded from mesophotic zones and deep <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> likely feed on mucus secreted by their coral hosts, as well as various detritus. Some species {{are thought to be}} filter feeders.|$|R
50|$|Rotaliids are {{primarily}} oceanic benthos, although some {{are common in}} shallower estuarine <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> also include many important fossils, such as the nummulitids.|$|R
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in <b>water</b> <b>they</b> move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
25|$|The {{biology and}} {{ecology of the}} western school whiting is {{relatively}} well known due {{to a series of}} studies conducted by researchers at Murdoch University and the Western Australian Marine Research Laboratories. Western school whiting, as their name suggests, are a schooling species, often mingling with other species of sillaginid. In shallower <b>waters,</b> <b>they</b> are often associated with Sillago burrus, Sillago schomburgkii and Sillago analis, while in deeper offshore <b>waters</b> <b>they</b> are often found with Sillago robusta, Sillago bassensis and Sillago burrus.|$|R
50|$|In 1897, Edgeworth-Johnstone married Helen Gunning Walker <b>Waters.</b> <b>They</b> had {{two sons}} and two daughters. He died 4 January 1936 in Regent's Park Terrace, London.|$|R
50|$|The species prefers {{cold climate}} <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> live in statoblastic colonies. The habitat is either lotic or lentic, {{including}} man-made water bodies such as gravel pits.|$|R
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold <b>water.</b> <b>They</b> have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
60|$|She flashed her torch {{across the}} dark <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> {{could not see}} the bank which they had left or the ridges to which they were making.|$|R
50|$|Lysmata {{occur in}} the tropics and in warmer {{temperate}} <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> usually live on rock and coral reefs, in shallow and deeper areas. Some live in sponges.|$|R
50|$|Lake trout inhabit cold, {{oxygen-rich}} <b>waters.</b> <b>They</b> are pelagic {{during the}} period of summer stratification in dimictic lakes, often living at depths of 20 - 60 m.|$|R
