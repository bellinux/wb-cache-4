50|$|Meanwhile, Bertarido {{reads the}} {{inscription}} {{on his own}} memorial.(Aria:"Dove sei, amato bene?") Along with Unulfo, he watches from hiding as Rodelinda and Flavio lay flowers at the memorial. Garibaldo enters and offers Rodelinda an ultimatum; either she agrees to marry Grimoaldo or Flavio will be killed. Rodelinda agrees, but warns Garibaldo that she will use his head as a step to the throne. Bertarido, still watching, takes Rodelinda's decision {{as an act of}} infidelity. Grimoaldo tells Garibaldo not to worry about Rodelinda's threat; under the king's protection, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to fear? Unulfo, meanwhile, tries to comfort Bertarido, but Bertarido is unconvinced.|$|E

Why is Pinocchio as a character able to speak to everybody and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to say, that is considered so important at all latitudes? From the esthetic-literary aspects (the genre, the register, the language, the theatre) to the educational ones, and the ones linked to the representations or metaphors of childhood (the bad boy, the Puer), from the mythical to the anthropological references (the Trickster, the initiation rhyte), from the philosophical themes (Death, the Becoming) to the religious ones (the Christologic undertones), some hypothesis to understand the universality of the character created by Collodi, but maybe, more properly, come to his mind through the complicated paths of a collective imaginary stretching back a long long time...|$|E
40|$|On a {{football}} field games are played between two teams, and the players of these teams get {{almost all of the}} attention. But there is another team on the field, the team of referees. The referees get mostly negative criticism, and are almost never mentioned in a positive way. This study is all about the teams’ captain, the main referee. Who is he? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to go through? What makes him continue in his career?   Earlier {{studies have shown that the}} work you do as a referee can be very stressful, with a lot of stressing factors coming from the players, the coaches, and at a higher level supporters and media (Nyberg, 2000, 2002). Because of all this, this study shows opinions from active referees in Allsvenskan in Sweden, and from some which are active on an international basis as well. Interviews have been made and a survey to compare the referees experiences with their sense of coherence, from Aaron Antonovskys theory SoC (Sense of Coherence).   The results are showing that yes, there are connections between a successful career as a referee and a high level of sense of coherence, and that the interviewed referees’ spend a huge amount of time to be able to perform. Even though they try their hardest, they have to deal with threats in their daily work. Therefore, you can find the conclusion that you need to have a certain type of personality to be able to make it as a referee...|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} child-psychiatric {{study of}} a group of three-year-old children of low birth weight and a control group of full-term children had its origins in the co-operation which exists between the department of paediatrics and the department of child psychiatry in Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam. Thanks to an increasing paediatric competence which finds expression in the highly specialized neonatal intensive care unit, the low-birth-weight child has an ever better prognosis as regards chances of surviving without serious physical sequelae (leaving aside the group with extremely low birth weights). The "Lancet" article of March 1971 entitled "Changeing prognosis for infants of very low birth weight" (Rawlings et al.) is, as it were, the exponent of this great medical progression. Alongside this, clinical experience had already taught paediatricians and child psychiatrists, via a lot of casuistics, that the overall development of the low-birthweight child- its development not merely from a somatic but also from an affective and cognitive viewpoint- is not always satisfactory. This gave rise to the question whether, from the standpoint of developmental psychology, children of low birth weight constituted a risk group. In order to acquire more comprehensive information than was to be found in most of the available literature, it was decided to undertake a combined intelligence and child-psychiatric study. The study has been restricted to a group of children tested at the age of three years. We are aware that this has its limitations: some researchers are more interested in development {{during the first year of}} life; others prefer to base their opinions on the low-birth-weight child during or after puberty, because it is only in adolescence that identity and character are definitively established. This study, therefore, claims to do no more than answer the following question: based on the group investigated, how far has the low-birthweight child come at three years of age with his developmental task compared with his full-term contemporary, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to contend with in terms of vulnerability...|$|E
