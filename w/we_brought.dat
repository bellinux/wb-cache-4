Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix.

After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. <b>We</b> <b>brought</b> EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E

The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer."

500|$|Creator Russell T Davies {{felt that}} killing off Ianto was {{necessary}} for Children of Earth; {{it was his first}} decision to create a [...] "horrible war casualty" [...] for the story, because it would be unrealistic to have a great threat and have the main characters all come out unscathed. Ianto's death also precedes the death of Captain Jack's grandson Steven (Bear McCausland), and for that scene to occur it necessitated making Jack [...] "badly, badly damaged". Ianto's death caused [...] "maximum damage" [...] to Jack, and the loss of his lover (and grandson) makes Children of Earth a tale of retribution, as Jack had given away twelve children to the same aliens in 1965. Davies has said that Ianto is [...] "absolutely dead". He explains his reasoning; because it's a [...] "much more real world in Torchwood", it wouldn't work to [...] "regenerate or go to a parallel universe." [...] Davies feels that Barrowman and David-Lloyd would both be dismayed were that to happen. He stated [...] "it would devalue the entire plot if <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> him back". Wired magazine described Ianto's arc, ending in the third series, as an [...] "evolution from meek office assistant to heroic warrior".|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{wanted to}} avoid the common {{depiction}} of Atlantis as [...] "crumbled Greek columns underwater", said Wise. [...] "From the get-go, we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> people on board who would help us develop those ideas." [...] Art director David Goetz stated, [...] "We looked at Mayan architecture, styles of ancient, unusual architecture {{from around the world}}, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture." [...] The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including Cambodian, Indian, and Tibetan works. Hahn added, [...] "If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like." [...] The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato, and his quote [...] "in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea" [...] was influential from the beginning of production. The crew wore T-shirts which read [...] "ATLANTIS—Fewer songs, more explosions" [...] due the film's plan as an action-adventure (unlike previous Disney animated features, which were musicals).|$|E

When the Tour de Georgia was first run in 2003, Tim Maloney of Cyclingnews.com referred to it as [...] "the prodigal son of Tour DuPont". In 2015, the UCI Road World Championships were held in Richmond, Virginia, which had previously hosted stages of the Tour de Trump and the Tour DuPont. In 1994, the Tour DuPont included a stage that concluded with several laps of a circuit incorporating the cobbled climb of Libby Hill Park. This hill was included in the circuit of the 2015 World Championship road races. Tour de Trump and Tour DuPont organizer Mike Plant was, according to USA Cycling, instrumental in Richmond's bid to hold the World Championships. As a member of the UCI Management Committee, when Richmond was announced as winning the bidding for the 2015 event, Plant commented that [...] "Richmond stepped up and proved they could support world class cycling when <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> the Tour de Trump and Tour DuPont to the city in the late '80s and early '90s".|$|E
