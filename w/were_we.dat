500|$|Dyke {{believed}} it was significant that [...] "six of the largest clubs" [...] voted against BSkyB. He wrote a formal letter to Quinton which asked for the bidding process to be reopened as the network was barred from bettering BSkyB's bid. Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms {{but as far as}} the potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed that it was only after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage <b>were</b> <b>we</b> informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor <b>were</b> <b>we</b> given any opportunity to increase our bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and it would be wrong to force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Krauss was {{apprehensive}} at first, noting drastic {{differences between}} her personal acoustic style {{and that of}} Twain. She stated, [...] "It's so {{different from what we}} do, we didn't know what liberties we were supposed to take. <b>Were</b> <b>we</b> supposed to learn it off the record? <b>Were</b> <b>we</b> supposed to learn the themes?" [...] She found aid in Twain's then-husband and producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who told Krauss to perform the songs as if they were her own. While preparing for the show, Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style. While traveling on the Up! Tour, Twain decided to cover of AC/DC's [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] (1980) for the television special. However, she edited the song's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager. Krauss later expressed her opposing views, saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics. The show was modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee to a crowd of 300 attendants. Up! Close and Personal was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, who also directed Up! Live in Chicago, and was produced by a team that consisted of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter.|$|E

Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor <b>were</b> <b>we</b> deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment.

Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why the hell did we give up Fanny? What on earth <b>were</b> <b>we</b> trying to prove?

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} airing of [...] "The Door", HBO {{released}} a featurette titled [...] "Anatomy of a Scene" [...] which went into greater {{detail about the}} creation of the final scene at the weirwood cave.

My goal was to make it realistic, make it terrifying, and make Hodor's sacrifice incredibly moving." [...] Most of the exterior shots with the White Walkers and their army took place at Magheramorne, a small hamlet in County Antrim, Northern Ireland near where Castle Black is also filmed. With input from David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, Bender, as well as visual effects supervisor Joe Bauer, also incorporated a transposing of scenes with Wights also crawling on the ceiling and the walls, which Bender hoped would result in the scene being even more [...] "creepy." ...|$|E

To him, Fowler wrote, [...] " [...] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful." [...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, <b>were</b> <b>we</b> bolder".|$|E

500|$|The story also {{deals with}} Alison Bechdel's own {{struggle}} with her sexual identity, reaching a catharsis in {{the realization that}} she is a lesbian and her coming out to her parents. The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood diary, anecdotes about masturbation, and tales of her first sexual experiences with her girlfriend, Joan. In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share obsessive-compulsive tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: [...] "I was Spartan to my father's Athenian. Modern to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his aesthete." [...] This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given gender roles: [...] "Not only <b>were</b> <b>we</b> inverts, we were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me. It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation." [...] However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.|$|E

That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we <b>were!</b> <b>We</b> were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Fuller {{was hoping}} to prepare a {{biography}} of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott's Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her [...] "conversations", discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended {{to compensate for the}} lack of women's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Serving as the [...] "nucleus of conversation", Fuller also intended to answer the [...] "great questions" [...] facing women: [...] "What <b>were</b> <b>we</b> born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by". A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.|$|E

500|$|The {{doctrine}} of substantive legitimate expectation {{has not yet}} been explicitly acknowledged as part of Singapore law. In Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997), the Singapore Court of Appeal had to decide whether life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant imprisonment for 20 years, which was the prevailing understanding, or whether it meant imprisonment for the remaining period of the convicted person's natural life. The Court concluded that the latter interpretation was correct, but overruled the former interpretation prospectively such that it only took effect from the date of the judgment and did not apply to the appellant. One of the reasons the Court relied on for doing so was the administrative law {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation. It recognized that [...] "certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right". Since for many years life imprisonment had been reckoned as 20 years' incarceration, this had given rise to a legitimate expectation according to which individuals had arranged their affairs. Thus, the Court ought to give effect to the expectation by prospectively overruling the prior interpretation. Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor <b>were</b> <b>we</b> deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E
500|$|Just before Exton's mayorality {{ended in}} October 1387, the {{parliament}} held at Cambridge by the victorious opponents of Richard II formally pardoned him for any treasons or felonies {{he may have}} committed in the previous years, and this parliament also forbade Londoners from making any criticisms of Exton regarding alleged derogation of the city's liberties. This referred to a rumour that in the previous (February 1388) parliament Exton [...] "sought to jeopardise the liberties of the city by petitioning parliament to make Robert Knolles captain of the city"; but that the lords, sitting in council in parliament, [...] "have been questioned about this matter... have concluded that Exton {{made no attempt to}} do this by petition or otherwise." [...] In May earlier that year, Exton had loaned the Appellant-controlled government the large sum of £1,000; for context, at the same time, the whole city lent £5,000. On the other hand, he was also actively profiting from the situation. [...] One of the responsibilities that the King's new officers (imposed on him after the Wonderful Parliament) had was to dispose of the forfeited estates of those condemned by the Appellants, a responsibility they enacted with zeal, and [...] "at what <b>were,</b> <b>we</b> may suspect, attractive prices." [...] Exton, says Professor Charles Ross, was one of their biggest buyers. He paid 500 marks for some de la Pole estates, and 700 marks for a manor of Sir John Holt's.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, Reagan {{met with}} his advisors at the White House, where a new plan was introduced. This one called for a slight change in the arms transactions: instead of the weapons going to the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian group, {{they would go to}} [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian army leaders. As each weapons {{delivery}} was made from Israel by air, the hostages held by Hezbollah would be released. Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the United States for the weapons. Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, the plan was authorized by Reagan, who stated that, [...] "We were not trading arms for hostages, nor <b>were</b> <b>we</b> negotiating with terrorists". In his notes of a meeting held in the White House on 7 December 1985, Weinberger wrote he told Reagan that this plan was illegal, writing: I argued strongly that we have an embargo that makes arms sales to Iran illegal and President couldn't violate it and that 'washing' transactions thru Israel wouldn't make it legal. Shultz, Don Regan agreed. Weinberger's notes has Reagan saying he [...] "could answer charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge that 'big strong President Reagan' passed up a chance to free hostages". Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar.|$|E
