5|$|Temples 10L-20 and 10L-21 <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> both {{built by}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. They were {{lost to the}} Copán River in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
50|$|Putney <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> settled {{during the}} Roman occupation. Lower Richmond Road <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a Roman Road, and the Lower Common <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an open pasture and farmland.|$|R

5000|$|Group 2A: {{the agent}} (mixture) <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{carcinogenic}} to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> carcinogenic to humans.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} decrees that <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> {{fraudulent}} were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, {{and it is}} believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.|$|E
5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am {{to prevent it from}} falling back into British hands. The guns recovered <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
50|$|The adult moths <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> nocturnal as <b>are</b> most noctuoids. The larvae <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> foliage eaters but are {{not known}} as an {{agricultural}} pest.|$|R

5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal {{body armour}} (usually {{in the form}} a chain mail cuirass) and helmets, in addition to shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal armour and helmets <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni foot soldiers had only shields and no metal armour or helmets.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{debris and}} ice <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa {{overlapping}} the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their maximum size shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to coincide with Lake Tauca.|$|E
5|$|In 1093 King Máel Coluim and David's brother Edward {{were killed}} at the River Aln during an {{invasion}} of Northumberland. David and his two brothers Alexander and Edgar, both future kings of Scotland, <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> present when their mother died shortly afterwards. According to later medieval tradition, the three brothers were in Edinburgh when they were besieged by their paternal uncle Donald.|$|E
5000|$|... 20000 Varuna {{is a large}} {{classical}} Kuiper belt object. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a dwarf planet. It rotates {{rapidly and}} hence its shape <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> very elongated.|$|R

The nave <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 12th century and the chancel <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 13th century. The chancel arch is also 13th century. The northeast window and blocked north doorway <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> 14th century and a buttress on the west wall <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 15th century. However, the building was so extensively restored and reworked in 1878 {{that it is difficult to}} date any of its features with certainty.|$|R
50|$|The castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built {{during the}} Celtic period as a refuge castle. The present burgstall only {{consists}} of two hollows between which the castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> located.|$|R
5|$|Josquin {{wrote in}} all of the {{important}} forms current at the time, including masses, motets, chansons, and frottole. He even contributed {{to the development of a}} new form, the motet-chanson, of which he left at least three examples. In addition, some of his pieces <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> intended for instrumental performance.|$|E
5|$|Lonchodectids {{are known}} to have had bodily {{proportions}} similar to those of azhdarchoids, and <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> similarly terrestrial. They are noted for rather unusual dentitions, however, and the possible member Prejanopterus possesses a bizarrely curved upper jaw that might indicate some specialized lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Military {{personnel}} {{who were involved}} in storage, mixture and transportation (including aircraft mechanics), and actual use of the chemicals <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> among those who received the heaviest exposures. Military members who served on Okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> of possessive origin {{derived from}} {{personal}} name Puńc (such a name <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> derived from Middle High German word punze, ponze, later a nickname?).|$|R

25|$|Z <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> for /ts/. U /u/ and V /w/ are {{distinguished}} in {{only one}} early inscription. Θ <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> for /t/ and X for /g/ (Lejeune 1971, Solinas 1985).|$|R
5|$|Structure 24 - two crude tennoned zoomorphic heads, {{possibly}} jaguar heads, {{were found}} near this structure but <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> ballcourt markers {{from one of}} the two ballcourts. It is likely that they served as a core onto which stucco modelling was applied.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> {{the first}} {{organized}} force to conduct successful {{battles in the}} desert. By knowing back routes and the locations of oases and by utilizing camels, Muslim Arab forces were able to successfully overcome both Roman and Persian forces in the period 600 to 700 AD during {{the expansion of the}} Islamic caliphate.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of Tohil {{was used}} for human sacrifice, {{the bodies of the}} {{sacrificial}} victims <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on a skull rack.

5|$|The {{anatomy of}} 'Pachycephalosaurus' is poorly known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from the snout. The spikes <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|The ancestry of Æthelberht, Eadbald's father, {{is given}} by Bede, who states that he was descended from the legendary founder of Kent, Hengist. However, historians believe that Hengist and his brother Horsa <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> mythical figures. It is known that Æthelberht married twice as Eadbald married his step-mother after his father's death, {{to the consternation of}} the church.|$|E
5|$|The medalet {{is part of}} {{the only}} late-6th or early-7th century find of gold {{jewellery}} in a grave in a churchyard. All of the coins in the hoard <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> part of a necklace that was buried in a woman's grave. The medalet itself is the earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon coin.|$|E
