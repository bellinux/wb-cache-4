25|$|Pointe {{technique}} {{is the part}} of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet within pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be en pointe when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be en pointe when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet.|$|E
25|$|Racing {{became more}} {{competitive}} with the introduction, in 1666, under King Charles II, of the King's Plate Races, designed {{so as to}} favour a fast yet strong horse, capable of winning a 4-mile race with a <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> of 12 stone. The winning horses were much sought after for breeding, leading to rapid improvement of the breed, with horses not in the winnings still capable hunters. The Curragh was awarded its plate in the 1670s, followed by the establishment in 1685 of a studbook under the Down Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders to promote the breeding of racehorses. The introduction of the Penal Laws, restricting Catholics to owning horses of a value less that £5, did little to deter horse owners, resulting in races limited to horses of that value. Race meetings were increasingly advertised in the press, and by 1750 even the English Racing Calendar advertised some 71 Irish events.|$|E

25|$|Clemente {{spent much}} of his time during the {{off-season}} involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who visited Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and subpar flight personnel, and was overloaded by 4,200 pounds. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972 due to engine failure. A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was {{the only member of the}} Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service. The Pirates catcher chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane, were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico (in a league later named after Clemente), helped Clemente load the plane, but either because of the plane's <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> or because he wanted Walker, who was single, to go enjoy New Year's, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. Walker's son is current Milwaukee Brewers second baseman and former Met and Pirate Neil Walker.|$|E

500|$|Some smaller bridges have {{a weight}} limit (or gross <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> rating) {{indicated}} by a sign posted in a visible position {{in front of}} the bridge (hence the reference to a [...] "posted bridge"). These are necessary when the weight limit of the bridge is lower than the federal or state gross weight limit for trucks. Driving a truck over a bridge that is too weak to support it usually does not result in an immediate collapse. The bridge may develop cracks, which over time can weaken the bridge and cause it to collapse. Most of these cracks are discovered during mandated inspections of bridges. Most bridge collapses occur in rural areas, result in few injuries or deaths, and receive relatively little media attention. While the number varies from year to year, as many as 150 bridges can collapse in a year. About 1,500 bridges collapsed between 1966 and 2007, and most of those were the result of soil erosion around bridge supports. In 1987, the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed in upstate New York, due to erosion of soil around the foundation, which sparked renewed interest in bridge design in inspection procedures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{additional}} {{mass of the}} soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building. [...] This makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented {{due to a lack}} of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight. [...] Some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world.

The striking design of the steeply slanted roof, the sleek aluminum-clad façade, and its base on four stilts over a church also on the site made the skyscraper an instant architectural icon. The sloping roof houses the building's mechanical and ventilation systems. The designers settled on an aluminum-clad façade to reduce the <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> on the building's foundation and support structures, since its entire weight would be supported by stilts. However, this did not come without a price; when the building was erected in 1977 it was discovered that the light-weight façade made the building vulnerable to swaying under high wind conditions. Concerned that the building might tip over in very high winds the building's engineers installed a [...] "Tuned mass damper" [...] in the roof which acts as a counterbalance to the building's swaying.|$|E

40|$|Pregnancy {{is a major}} {{physiological}} stress of the cardiovascular system. Weight gain significantly contributes to physical limitations. This thesis examines the effects on both physical and cardiac performance of weight gain in pregnancy. Utilising cardiac power output at rest and maximal exercise, I measured the effects of (i) inert <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> (ii) pregnancy and (iii) obesity in the non-pregnant state, to determine the acute, chronic and also reversible changes. <b>Weight</b> <b>loading</b> using a pregnancy simulator suit (“Empathy Belly”) showed reduced physical performance, whilst showing an improvement in cardiac performance, predominantly by increasing the pressure generating capacity of the heart. Additional load carriage with the “Empathy Belly” and a rucksack, showed further reduction in physical performance, but no further improvement in cardiac performance. Pregnancy revealed significant reductions in physical performance and maintenance in cardiac performance compared to the non-pregnant post-partum. Contrary to this, there were significant reductions in both physical and cardiac performance in pregnancy, compared to pre-conception. Changes in cardiac performance throughout pregnancy gradually improved, whilst there was a deterioration in overall physical performance. Obesity in the non-pregnant state, showed significant reduction in physical performance with a marked increase in cardiac performance. This was primarily driven {{by an increase in}} the flow generating capacity of the heart; the cardiac output. Inert <b>weight</b> <b>loading,</b> <b>weight</b> carriage in pregnancy and non-physiological weight gain in obesity in the non-pregnant state, all reduce physical performance. In contrast to this, both inert weight carriage and weight carriage in obesity increase cardiac performance. Acute <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> induces an increase in pressure generating capacity, whilst chronic weight carriage leads to an increase in flow generating capacity. For the first time, I have shown that peak cardiac performance reduces in pregnancy from pre-conception, although this gradually improves throughout pregnancy and is likely to be in part caused by an increase in weight gain. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{melt flow}} {{properties}} of the KF reinforced FLO/MH bicomposites have been studied for varying temperatures and <b>weight</b> <b>loads.</b> In general, the melt flow capability has been increased for higher temperatures and <b>weight</b> <b>loads.</b> This is because the macromolecular chain has absorbed more heat at higher temperature, causing a weaker bonding. On the other hand, the shear thinning effect has been found for higher weight loadings, resulting in higher melt flow properties. FLO has the lowest melt flow indices; {{it is believed that}} the hydroxyl groups from the KF and the MH induced hydrolytic degradation on the PLA in FLO. A high content of MH induced new network junctions with better interaction forces and friction forces, causing lower MFR and MVR values. On the other hand, the smooth surface of KF has been forced to align in the flow direction when a load is applied, resulting in higher melt flow properties. Besides this, {{a large portion of the}} flow velocity was contributed by the wall slip theory, especially for low <b>weight</b> <b>loading.</b> However, complicated melt flow behaviour for KF reinforced FLO/MH biocomposites has been found in this study. A high probability of KF–KF/KF–MH collisions is expected and there are more collisions with higher fibre loading. On the other hand, increasing the MH loading in the MH biocomposites has constantly decreased the MFR and MVR values, showing that the stronger bonding in the biocomposites has resisted the macromolecular chain flow.|$|R
