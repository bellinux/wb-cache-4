25|$|The folk {{religious}} practices offer {{a very different}} aspect of life from the Buddhist practices.

This idea of relieving stress and indulging in various pleasures {{is very different from the}} traditional doctrine of Buddhism, which emphasises losing all desires. This can often be done by fasting or through deep meditation in a quiet temple. These traditional Buddhist practices offer a starkly different way of achieving religious consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{called the}} Office of Handicapped Services, DSPD {{was created in}} 1979 to manage {{what is now called}} the Utah State Developmental Center. This is the state-funded {{institution}} for people with disabilities in American Fork, Utah. In 1983 Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a positive step as they provided a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same institutional care in the community cost less.|$|E
25|$|People use social {{networking}} sites for meeting new friends, finding old friends, or locating {{people who have the}} same problems or interests they have, called niche networking.

Witte has said that in less than 10 years, online dating will be the predominant <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to start a relationship. One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site, the equivalent of 236 marriages a day. Other sites claim one in five relationships begin online.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the early}} concept for {{the album was}} to show the band's reality and {{development}} in a chronological order, the earthquake made the band re-evaluate {{what they wanted to}} express with their documentary theme. Instead, the band decided to express what living in 2011 was like. Yamaguchi felt inspired to create music that when listened to strongly expressed the sentiments of a certain era, which he saw in the music of John Lennon, Bob Dylan and in Japanese singer Yōsui Inoue's song [...] "Kasa ga Nai" [...] (1972); as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> in the future to be able to experience how people felt during the post-earthquake era.

500|$|The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend, {{and played}} its first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city centre. After a few {{performances}} in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, {{now known as}} Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned on to CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying [...] "we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway – that was a better <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to hear them." ...|$|E
