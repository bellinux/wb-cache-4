25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the {{doctrine of}} the nature of the atonement. It also has much to do with the general Calvinist view of predestination. Calvinists advocate the satisfaction theory of the atonement, which developed in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as penal substitution, states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the sins of menthat is, Christ receives the <b>wrath</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men.|$|E

Fearing that they intended sacrilege, some of those who were assigned to the task were murdered by a band of iconodules. Accounts of this event (written significantly later) suggest that {{at least part of the}} reason for the removal may have been military reversals against the Muslims and the eruption of the volcanic island of Thera, which Leo possibly viewed as evidence of the <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> brought on by image veneration in the Church.|$|E
