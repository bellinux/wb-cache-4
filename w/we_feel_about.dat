500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{perceived}} adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, {{especially those}} {{with whom she had}} once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: [...] "My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to the columnist Simon Hoggart, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: [...] "If it sounds true, if it echoes something <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the politician, then it will cling to him or her as if bonded with superglue".|$|E

[...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{documentary}} called The Butch Factor, {{a number of}} gay men—one of them transgender—were asked about their views on masculinity. The consensus was that showing masculine traits was an advantage, {{both in and out}} the closet. For the [...] "butch" [...] gay men, this allowed them to conceal their sexual orientation for longer when doing masculine activities such as playing sports, as effeminacy is often incorrectly associated with homosexuality— so much so that they doubted their own sexual orientation; because they did not see themselves as effeminate, they did not feel they were gay. Because of this, they did not feel as much of a connection with gay culture. Men who had a more feminine appearance were the first {{to come out of the}} closet; they were the first to be labelled gay by their peers. They were more likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives; many gay men have been taunted using derogatory words that imply feminine qualities, for example, sissy. Effeminate or camp-acting gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew describes as [...] "camp humour", such as referring to one another using female pronouns as [...] "a funny way of defusing hate directed toward [...] ".

60|$|If secession be a right, {{then the}} moment of its {{exercise}} is wholly optional with those possessing it. Suppose, {{on the eve of}} a war with England, Michigan should vote herself out of the Union and declare herself annexed to Canada, what kind of a reception would her commissioners be likely to meet in Washington, and what scruples should <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> coercion? Or, to take a case precisely parallel to that of South Carolina, suppose that Utah, after getting herself admitted to the Union, should resume her sovereignty, as it is pleasantly called, and block our path to the Pacific, under the pretence that she did not consider her institutions safe while the other States entertained such unscriptural prejudices against her special weakness in the patriarchal line. Is the only result of our admitting a Territory on Monday to be the giving it a right to steal itself and go out again on Tuesday? Or do only the original thirteen States possess this precious privilege of suicide? We shall need something like a Fugitive Slave Law for runaway republics, and must get a provision inserted in our treaties with foreign powers, that they shall help us catch any delinquent who may take refuge with them, as South Carolina has been trying to do with England and France. It does not matter to the argument, except so far as the good taste of the proceeding is concerned, at what particular time a State may make her territory foreign, thus opening one gate of our national defences and offering a bridge to invasion. The danger of the thing is in her making her territory foreign under any circumstances; and it is a danger which the government must prevent, if only for self-preservation. Within the limits of the constitution two sovereignties cannot exist; and yet what practical odds does it make, if a State may become sovereign by simply declaring herself so? The legitimate consequence of secession is, not that a State becomes sovereign, but that, so far as the general government is concerned, she has outlawed herself, nullified her own existence as a State, and become an aggregate of riotous men who resist the execution of the laws.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{sometimes}} curious to notice how a critic, possessing no little cultivation and fertility, will, in speaking {{of a work}} of art, let fall almost accidentally some apparently trivial comment, which reveals to us with an instantaneous and complete mental illumination the fact that he does not, so far as that work of art is concerned, in the smallest degree understand what he is talking about. He may have intended to correct merely some minute detail of the work he is studying, but that single movement is enough to blow him and all his diplomas into the air. These are the sensations with which the true Browningite will regard the criticism made by so many of Browning's critics and biographers about The Ring and the Book. That criticism was embodied by one of them in the words [...] "the theme looked at dispassionately is unworthy of the monument in which it is entombed for eternity." [...] Now this remark shows at once that the critic does not know what The Ring and the Book means. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> it as we should feel about a man who said that the plot of Tristram Shandy was not well constructed, or that the women in Rossetti's pictures did not look useful and industrious. A man who has missed the fact that Tristram Shandy is a game of digressions, that the whole book is a kind of practical joke to cheat the reader out of a story, simply has not read Tristram Shandy at all. The man who objects to the Rossetti pictures because they depict a sad and sensuous day-dream, objects to their existing at all. And any one who objects to Browning writing his huge epic round a trumpery and sordid police-case has in reality missed the whole length and breadth of the poet's meaning. The essence of The Ring and the Book is that it is the great epic of the nineteenth century, because it is the great epic of the enormous importance of small things. The supreme difference that divides The Ring and the Book from all the great poems of similar length and largeness of design is precisely the fact that all these are about affairs commonly called important, and The Ring and the Book is about an affair commonly called contemptible. Homer says, [...] "I will show you the relations between man and heaven as exhibited in a great legend of love and war, which shall contain the mightiest of all mortal warriors, and the most beautiful of all mortal women." [...] The author of the Book of Job says, [...] "I will show you the relations between man and heaven by a tale of primeval sorrows and the voice of God out of a whirlwind." [...] Virgil says, [...] "I will show you the relations of man to heaven by the tale of the origin of the greatest people and the founding of the most wonderful city in the world." [...] Dante says, [...] "I will show you the relations of man to heaven by uncovering the very machinery of the spiritual universe, and letting you hear, as I have heard, the roaring of the mills of God." [...] Milton says, [...] "I will show you the relations of man to heaven by telling you of the very beginning of all things, and the first shaping of the thing that is evil in the first twilight of time." [...] Browning says, [...] "I will show you the relations of man to heaven by telling you a story out of a dirty Italian book of criminal trials from which I select one of the meanest and most completely forgotten." [...] Until we have realised this fundamental idea in The Ring and the Book all criticism is misleading.|$|E
