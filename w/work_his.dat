5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's drinking, {{already a}} problem, worsened {{and he was}} {{diagnosed}} with cirrhosis of the liver. (Ironically, when younger, he had been an adamant teetotaler.) While he completed his year's <b>work,</b> <b>his</b> condition continued to deteriorate, and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His family opted for a private funeral service, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (he was {{actually}} 69), was appointed {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941.

5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz's {{childhood}} environment exerted a {{major influence}} on his literary <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened more violence if their demands were not met.

5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most of his followers to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south. They first arrived at Ambeso, but the fortress fell several days later, at which time they evacuated to Alla'. This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to <b>work</b> <b>his</b> way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to <b>work</b> <b>his</b> campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to <b>work</b> <b>his</b> way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a sexual interest in Jack he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers.|$|E

Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable to <b>work</b> <b>his</b> fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains {{the favor of}} the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts {{to use the money}} to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E
5|$|By 1730, on the {{recommendation}} of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly-formed Freikompanie (independent company) of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the Rittmeister with 50 thalers a month's salary. In summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks of arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Károly József Batthyány, the Austrian hussars' superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736.|$|E
5|$|During the 18thcentury {{the castle}} {{was allowed to}} languish. The {{south-west}} tower was falling apart and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt {{towards the end of}} the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop Thomas Percy's poem, The Hermit of Warkworth. In the mid 19thcentury Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, undertook some preservation <b>work.</b> <b>His</b> successor, Algernon Percy, contracted Anthony Salvin to restore the keep. The work undertaken between 1853 and 1858 was not as extensive as Salvin had planned, and was limited to partially refacing the exterior and adding new floors and roofs to two chambers, which became known as the Duke's Chambers, on the second floor. The duke occasionally used the chambers for picnics when he visited from Alnwick Castle. Algernon Percy funded excavations at the castle in the 1850s which uncovered the remains of the collegiate church within the bailey.|$|E
