5|$|A heliacal rising of Sothis was {{recorded}} in the reign of Thutmose's predecessor, Amenhotep I, which has been dated to 1517 BC, assuming the observation was made at Thebes. The year of Amenhotep's death and Thutmose's subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived, and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars. However, if the observation <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> either Heliopolis or Memphis, as a minority of scholars promote, Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.|$|E
5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America after changes <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> their request {{in order to avoid}} an R rating, which it had {{received}} twice before. The film was presented and widely released on July 2, 2008 in the United States and the United Kingdom by Columbia Pictures. Hancock received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $624 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Photometric {{observations}} of Vesta <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the Harvard College Observatory in 1880–1882 {{and at the}} Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta {{to be determined by}} the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo.|$|E

5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification test flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
5|$|The four nails <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> {{different}} times, {{and this}} is reflected in their varying designs. One of the nails bears the name John Barker on its rim. Barker was a wealthy merchant who owned houses and storehouses on the Quay, in Wine Street and in Small Street.

5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the military level.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} attempts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> seasonal truces; a German unit {{attempted to}} leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|Border {{made his}} Test debut against England in December 1978 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His first century came {{three months later}} against Pakistan at the same venue. Border's 27 Test {{hundreds}} were scored at 14 different grounds; 14 hundreds <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> venues outside Australia. In Tests, he was most successful against England accumulating eight centuries. Border's highest score of 205 – one of his two double centuries – came against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval in 1987. As of 2012, he is thirteenth overall {{in the list of}} most hundreds in Test cricket.|$|E

5|$|By late on July3, Ana {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later. Minimal impact was reported {{as a result}} of Ana, other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina. Due to the rough seas, 14rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach. In addition, five rescues <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> Kure Beach and at least one person was hospitalized. However, there were no fatalities at either location.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for artillery fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> <b>at</b> Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American Sheep Breeder at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (the same of Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep Breeder, 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E
