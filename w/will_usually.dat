5|$|P. labiata will {{sometimes}} approach a translucent nest containing another spider, and <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> wait facing the prey {{for up to}} several hours. Occasionally P. labiata leaps at the prey in the nest, but this is ineffective.|$|E

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E

5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> pursue most {{creatures that}} it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry. Such referrals result in what are generally known as budget estimates hearings. Senate standing committees <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates).|$|E

5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The Sibu Night Market was {{established}} in 1973. It was situated in the town centre. Local traders <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> set up their mobile stalls from 5pm to 10pm every day. The stalls offer household goods, footwear, fashion items, and varieties of food. In August 2012, the market was relocated to Butterfly Garden at Cross Road near the Tua Pek Kong Temple to ease traffic jams.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|Vegetable salads are eaten {{with most}} meals, {{including}} the traditional Israeli breakfast, which <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> include eggs, bread, {{and dairy products}} such as yogurt or cottage cheese.

At four minutes, the judge <b>will</b> signal (<b>usually</b> with two knocks) and the student may finish his or her sentence, but then must stop speaking and sit down. A two-member team may still debate, with one member speaking twice. A student who speaks twice will be scored only {{for his or her}} first speech.|$|R

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They <b>will</b> <b>usually</b> disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
