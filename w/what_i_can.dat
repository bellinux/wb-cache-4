This interest in classical forms is linked to his training as a Hindustani classical vocalist and composer.|$|E

Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then I ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, and I mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E

The concert {{featured}} {{a number of}} well-known artists, including Dire Straits, Miriam Makeba, Simple Minds, Eurythmics, and Tracy Chapman. During his live performances of [...] "Biko", Gabriel frequently concluded asking the audience to engage in political action, saying [...] "I've done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> the rest is up to you." [...] It was often the last song of a performance, with the band members gradually leaving the stage during the song's concluding drum solo.|$|E

Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: [...] "While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say with certainty is that no driver disagreed." [...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present.

And I don't want to start {{thinking}} about that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start deliberately worrying about why or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to make it happen again".

500|$|Fleming {{said of his}} work, [...] "while thrillers may not be Literature with {{a capital}} L, it is {{possible}} to write <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He named Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene as influences. William Cook in the New Statesman considered James Bond to be [...] "the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel H. C. McNeile (aka [...] "Sapper") and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age." [...] Umberto Eco considered Mickey Spillane to have been another major influence.|$|E

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really do." ...|$|E

500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady you are and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance." [...] Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.|$|E

When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: [...] "Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years.

500|$|Sanctus Real's main genre is {{typically}} labeled as Christian rock and alternative CCM. Their first three independent albums were described by Allmusic as power pop. Say It Loud {{was characterized by}} increased guitars and a powerful modern rock style. Their second release, Fight the Tide, was described as [...] "melodic power rock" [...] with similarities to Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, U2, and PFR. The band's music on The Face of Love blended the styles from their previous two albums, evolving into less of a heavier rock sound. With We Need Each Other, lead singer Matt Hammitt noted that he [...] "just pushed the limits of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do vocally" [...] during some songs, [...] "whether it be on a soft, kind of rustic sounding vocal or whether it be this overdriven, rock high-range kind of vocal." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

When {{asked if he would}} rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, [...] "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like [...] "American Pie" [...] or something, but I'm just gonna do what I do and take <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have.

He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the author Kingsley Amis called [...] "the Fleming effect". Amis describes it as [...] "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world... bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced." [...] Within the text the novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—identifies what he described as the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what the novelist Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E

[...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and can't say.

Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.
