40|$|Before {{converting}} {{raw materials}} to a finished product {{we need an}} accurate design of the product and also data required for manufacturing. If the design is not accurate then defects will occur in the manufactured product; small mistakes in designing a product makes the manufactured product useless so more amount time is allotted for designing a new product (or) for modifying the existed design. In this work {{the use of a}} software namely Pro/E for designing a progressive die to manufacture <b>washer</b> <b>for</b> the M 12 bolt has been incorporated. A progressive die is a multiple station die. In this work authors have designed a progressive die which has two stages of operation. The former operation is piercing and is followed by blanking. In both operations a finite volume of metal is removed from the sheet metal. If the final product happens to be removed portion then the operation is blanking, on other hand if pierced sheet metal is the final product then the operation is piercing. Both the operations are performed simultaneously in a single stroke of press, thus enabling the user to obtain the final product in a single stroke. This design procedure can also be extended <b>for</b> manufacturing <b>washers</b> <b>for</b> M-series bolts by modifying the punch and die plate dimensions.

40|$|AbstractBolted joints {{are used}} for {{fastening}} components together in the industry, aeronautics and in railways. These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening. For this purpose tests were conducted using three different tightening torque values, in the vicinity of rated torque. Washers of different types are used in bolted joint, with an understanding that they prevent or retard loosening. This study also attempts to examine the role of two types of most commonly used washers: the plain washer and the spring washer. Trials were also performed on joint without any <b>washer,</b> <b>for</b> the sake of comparison of loosening performance of the joint. The results of this experimental study are shown in terms of starting point of loosening of joint and rate of loosening of the joint. Various combinations of <b>washers</b> <b>for</b> three values of tightening torque are considered in the experimental study. The results are useful in understanding the role of type of washer in prevention of loosening of the bolted joint...|$|R
