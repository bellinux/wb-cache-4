500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> and the last thing I think of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained {{in an interview that}} she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, [...] "We're not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we're great people with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. The Washington Post called it [...] "overlooked".|$|E

[...] "Dame" [...] is a R-lite" [...] with tune hip-hop influences. Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads." [...] The first track on the album, [...] "Si Te Vas", is a song about the narrator who yearns to remain with his lover: ("Every morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up, I feel anxiety in my soul, I want to listen to your voice, I want to feel your kisses"). The power ballads in the album are [...] "Que Tú Te Vas", [...] "Abrázame", [...] "Un Día Más", and the title track. For arrangements on the ballads, Miguel received assistance from the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The album also features the song [...] "Sueña", the Spanish-language version of [...] "Someday" [...] by All-4-One from the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It was released as a single for the Latin American edition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame soundtrack and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, and number one on the Latin Pop Songs charts.|$|E

2500|$|A host {{of local}} campesinos went on record to journalists from The Guardian about this {{phenomenon}} as well. Melanio Moscoso, of La Higuera stated [...] "we pray to him, {{we are so}} proud he had died here, in La Higuera, fighting for us. We feel him so close", while Freddy Vallejos, of Vallegrande, proclaimed [...] "we have a faith, a confidence in Che. When I go to bed and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up, I first pray to God and then I pray to Che – and then, everything is all right. Che's presence here is a positive force. I feel it in my skin, I have faith that always, at all times, he has an eye on us." [...] Remi Calzadilla, a resident of Pucara, claimed that praying to Che had helped him regain the ability to walk, adding that [...] "now every time I speak to Che I {{feel a strong force}} inside of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tobacco {{and alcohol}} {{are the most}} common {{substances}} that elderly people get a dependence on or misuse. The next-most-common substance that elderly people develop a drug dependence to or misuse is benzodiazepines. Drug-induced cognitive problems can have serious consequences for elderly people and can lead to confusional states and [...] "pseudo-dementia". About 10% of elderly patients referred to memory clinics actually have a drug-induced cause that most often is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have also been linked to an increased risk of road traffic accidents and falls in the elderly. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are still not fully understood in the elderly or any age group. Long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with attentional and visuospatial functional impairments. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to improved alertness and decreased forgetfulness in the elderly. Withdrawal led to statistical significant improvements in memory function and performance related skills in those having withdrawn successfully from benzodiazepines, whereas those having remained on benzodiazepines experienced worsening symptoms. People having withdrawn from benzodiazepines also felt their sleep was more refreshing, making statements such as [...] "I feel sharper <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up" [...] or [...] "I feel better, more awake", or [...] "It used to take me an hour to fully wake up." [...] This suggests that benzodiazepines may actually make insomnia worse in the elderly.|$|E
