25|$|In April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong {{confided to}} a state trooper that she had {{information}} about the Wells' case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> everything she knew if she was transferred from Muncy State Penitentiary to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> the whole story in return for a reduced sentence. He told them that Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.|$|E

He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored someone he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> personally.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to return home to their wives and families.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought it absolutely crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E
500|$|While Eddy {{argued that}} reality was entirely spiritual (and {{therefore}} entirely good), it remained true {{that human beings}} were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was [...] "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted," [...] writes Wilson. To defend herself against it, Eddy organized [...] "watches," [...] during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give [...] "adverse treatment" [...] to her enemies. This was called [...] "taking up the enemy in thought." [...] According to former students, Eddy <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): [...] "You are affected as you wish to affect me. Your evil thought reacts upon you," [...] then call Kennedy bilious, consumptive or poisoned by arsenic.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had.

2500|$|After {{listening}} to Rice-Oxley's piano playing during a weekend at Virginia Water, Surrey in 1997, Chris Martin {{invited him to}} join his newly formed band Coldplay. However, Rice-Oxley declined {{because he did not}} want to leave [...] "The Lotus Eaters", stating, [...] "I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay's keyboard player idea was dropped." [...] Because of Martin's offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley's place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin's recruitment also marked a change of name from [...] "The Lotus Eaters" [...] to [...] "Cherry Keane", after a friend of Chaplin's mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. She took care of them and <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> to go for their dreams. At her death from cancer, she had left money for Chaplin's family.

2500|$|Lem Ownby, David Ownby's legendary grandson, {{was born}} near Jakes Creek in 1889.

[...] Ownby obtained a lifetime lease when the national park was established, and for several decades afterward sold honey to hikers. Among those who paid Ownby a visit were Tennessee governor (and later U.S. senator) Lamar Alexander and U.S. Supreme Court justices Harry Blackmun and Potter Stewart. [...] The Justices were visiting a prominent Knoxville lawyer, Foster Arnett, who wanted to introduce them to a real mountain man. [...] Foster led the two Justices up the trail to meet Lem only to discover Lem would not meet the two men. [...] When Foster knocked on Lem's door and announced that he had two Supreme Court Justices outside who wanted to meet him, Lem simply replied that they were not welcome to come in the cabin. [...] Foster was very embarrassed while the two Justices folded over laughing. [...] The two Justices loved that Lem had refused to meet them because he was the one person who <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> no, something they seldom found.
