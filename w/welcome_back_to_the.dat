5000|$|In 2010 Rourke {{played the}} role of the main villain Whiplash in the film Iron Man 2.

In 2011, he portrayed the villainous King Hyperion in Immortals and received praise for his performance, while the film received mixed-to-positive reviews and became a box office success. He also had a minor role as Tool in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables. Though he had little screen time, his performance was met with rave reviews and cited as one of the film's highlights.

[...] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, saying [...] "Watching this new episode after The Simpsons only served to {{highlight}} how similar the two sitcoms are in their core ideas, but how Bob’s Burgers skewers the conventions in ways that the show before it (and most definitely the shows after it) are unable to do. Bob’s throws witty pop culture references into each episode—the John & Yoko Rolling Stone cover nod when Bob & Linda wake in the woods was particularly nice. The rest shove them so far down the viewers throats, it’s a wonder we all don’t gag involuntarily as we watch. Each have their charms, but Bob’s Burgers is standing head and shoulders above the animation competition. As this episode proved, the fifth season was earned, and I can’t wait to see where they take us next." ...|$|E
