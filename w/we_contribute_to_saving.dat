30|$|<b>We</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{two groups}} of {{literature}}. First, <b>we</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{the literature on the}} link between income and risk behavior. Most of the relevant work in this area focuses on the associations between poverty, violent crime, and conflict (see Bazzi and Blattman 2014; Berman and Couttenier 2015; Dube and Vargas 2013; Iyer and Topalova 2014; Miguel et al. 2004). Most of these studies show that unexpected negative changes in income or unemployment increase violent crime and conflict. We instead analyze the effects of a positive income shock (caused by higher employment due to the youth training program) on risk behavior of young adult men.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of mass screening for uterine cancer in Japan, we compared the changes in the age-adjusted rates of potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to uterine cancer between 1969 and 1972 to 1973 through 1977 between the high coverage-rate (intensively screened) areas and the comparable control areas. The percent reduction in the average age-adjusted rate of PYLL due to uterine cancer and the years of life saved per 100, 000 females were greater in the high coverage-rate areas than in the control areas. These results suggested that mass screening programs for uterine cancer <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>saving</b> years of life...|$|R
