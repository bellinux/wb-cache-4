60|$|THE LIMITATIONS OF DICKENS. Any severe {{criticism}} of Dickens as a novelist must seem, at first glance, unkind an unnecessary. In almost every house he {{is a welcome}} guest, a personal friend who has beguiled many an hour with his stories, and who has furnished us much good laughter and a few good tears. Moreover, he has always a cheery message. He emphasizes {{the fact that this}} is an excellant world; that some errors have crept into it, due largely to thoughtlessness, but that they can be easily remedied by a little human sympathy. That is a most welcome creed to an age overburdened with social problems; and to criticise our cheery companion seems as discourteous as to speak unkindly of a guest who has just left our home. But we must consider Dickens not merely as a friend, but as a novelist, and apply to his work the same standards of art which we apply to other writers; and when we do this we are sometimes a little disappointed. We must confess that his novels, while they contain many realistic details, seldom give the impression of reality. His characters, though we laugh or weep or shudder at them, are sometimes only caricatures, each one an exaggeration of some peculiarity, which suggest Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour. It is Dickens's art to give his heroes sufficient reality to make them suggest certain types of men and women whom we know; but in reading him we find ourselves often in the mental state of a man who is watching through a microscope the swarming life of a <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> Here are lively, bustling, extraordinary creatures, some beautiful, some grotesque, but all far apart from the life that we know in daily experience. It is certainly not the reality of these characters, but rather the genius of the author in managing them, which interests us and holds our attention. Notwithstanding this criticism, which we would gladly have omitted, Dickens is excellent reading, and his novels will continue to be popular just so long as men enjoy a wholesome and absorbing story.|$|E

The wind [...] Told a love-tale beside us, how he woo'd [...] The waters, and the crisp'd waters lisp'd [...] The kisses of the wind, that, sick with love, [...] Fainted at intervals, and grew again [...] To utterance of passion. Ye cannot shape [...] Fancy so fair as is this memory. [...] Methought all excellence that ever was [...] Had drawn herself from many thousand years, [...] And all the separate Edens of this earth, [...] To centre in this place and time. I listen'd, [...] And her words stole with most prevailing sweetness [...] Into my heart, as thronged fancies come, [...] All unawares, into the poet's brain; [...] Or as the dew-drops on the petal hung, [...] When summer winds break their soft sleep with sighs, [...] Creep down {{into the bottom of}} the flower.

Here, we conducted both computational and experimental studies of this phyto-optical phenomenon in order to clarify the specific environmental conditions under which sunlit <b>water</b> <b>drops</b> can cause leaf burn. We found that a spheroid drop at solar elevation angle θ ≈ 23 °, corresponding to early morning or late afternoon, produces a maximum intensity of focused sunlight on the leaf outside the drop's imprint.
