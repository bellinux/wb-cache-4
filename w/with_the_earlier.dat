5|$|The neo-noir film genre {{developed}} mid-way {{into the}} Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected {{much of the}} cynicism {{and the possibility of}} nuclear annihilation of the era.

5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E

5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found {{large quantities of}} Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians {{to conclude that the}} area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. The most significant item found was the Celtic La Tène style bronze and enamel Battersea Shield, {{one of the most important}} pieces of Celtic military equipment found in Britain, recovered from the riverbed during dredging for the piers.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} drain on Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC. 'Design X', along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret. This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet.

They were ordered {{as part of the}} Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in America, the 64th {{remained}} in Jamaica for two years, returning to England in 1783. Four {{years later the}} regiment was stationed in Ireland, before sailing once more for the West Indies in 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars. At the end of the Seven Years' War both Martinique and Guadeloupe had been returned to France {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot took part in the invasion of Martinique in early 1794. As before the flank companies were detached from the rest of the regiment but all three elements were involved in the actions in Martinique. This short but successful campaign earned the regiment its second battle honour, Martinique 1794—although as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Guadeloupe honour, it was not actually awarded until 1909.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This {{is composed of}} a wide variety of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E
5|$|However, Ober Ost, the German {{military}} administration, {{rejected the}} changes. On January 26, in compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> request, the {{two versions of}} the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of January 8. The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.|$|E

5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences when compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon {{is to be}} equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed {{to the failure of}} the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
5|$|The action, {{and that}} of <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Action of 26 July 1806, {{demonstrated}} {{the weakness of the}} Dutch squadron in the East Indies and convinced Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to lead an operation against Batavia to eliminate the remainder of the Dutch squadron in November 1806. This second raid was only partially successful, and was followed a year later by a raid on the harbour of Griessie, in which the last Dutch warships in the East were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The commote of Glynrhondda was coterminous <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> parish of Ystradyfodwg, {{but little}} is known of the Celtic saint Tyfodwg, or Dyfodwg after whom the parish is named. Saint Tyfodwg {{is thought to have}} existed around 600AD, and {{although}} the parish bears his name there are now no religious monuments or places of worship named after him within the Rhondda boundaries. There are two churches in South Wales outside the area named after the saint; Y Tre Sant in Llantrisant and Saint Tyfodwg’s in Ogmore Vale.|$|E

5|$|As with Nero, it is {{possible}} that music from Florindo or Daphne was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The overture to the opera Rodrigo consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709–10 Handel composed the cantata Apollo e Dafne, which has common ground <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> operas. Harris makes the point that when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the Florinda and Daphne music may have re-emerged: the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (1707); the opera Radamisto (1720); and the overture in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the overture to Florindo. This last-named has been combined with HWV352–354 and HWV356 to form the Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne, which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30, D Company {{launched}} an assault against the ridge {{south of the}} road, with two platoons of Sherman tanks in support from D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion. One tank platoon led the attack followed by the other carrying infantry from 10 Platoon D Company. Under the command of Lieutenant David Mannett, 10 Platoon made a right flanking assault along the road, while 11 and 12 Platoons attacked the ridge frontally across the paddy fields. Meeting stronger resistance than expected however, the attackers {{came under heavy fire}} and one of the Sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour-piercing round that hit its turret. However, with the American tanks providing vital close support to the infantry, 10 Platoon successfully secured its objective, allowing it to take the North Koreans in enfilade and to provide fire support to the assault. Thus, despite strong opposition, the remainder of D Company gained the high ground by 16:30. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> airstrikes having been ineffective, D Company had been opposed by a number of T-34 tanks and SU-76 self-propelled guns, however the bulk of these were destroyed by the Shermans during the assault. Another tank had been knocked out by well-directed fire at point-blank range from a Bren light machine-gun by Private John Stafford, which caused the armoured vehicle's auxiliary fuel tanks to ignite, resulting in its ammunition exploding. Stafford was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star for his bravery.|$|E
