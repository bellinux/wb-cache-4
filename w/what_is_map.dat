Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001) examined this question by running a comparative, corpus-based study of metaphors in Spanish and English financial reporting. They argue that both languages show considerable similarity {{in the choice}} of conceptual metaphors with the same linguistic expressions but that there is a differing degree of frequency. They attribute this similarity to the common cultural identity of the two languages such as the similar economic system and their Latinate origins.

Although these projects are ambitious in their aim to propose alternative organizations of urban space through the way it <b>is</b> digitally <b>mapped,</b> they remain bounded by datasets that reinforce a Cartesian and static notion of urban space. This paper questions the methodology of the base <b>map</b> as it <b>is</b> utilized in these projects, and proposes alternative approaches for mapping the city. Specifically, it looks at {{the city as a}} space of events, defined by the ways in which it is used rather than the orthogonal geometry by which it is constructed; and highlights several key examples from the history of urban planning and art practice that provide models for such alternative mapping strategies. By focusing on the limitations of the base map, I hope to provoke new ideas for these emerging projects. Giles Lane, "ordinary citizens embed social knowledge in the new landscape of the city.

40|$|Forest Information Services and Systems (FISs) are {{becoming}} increasingly numerous {{largely because of the}} relatively recent increased ease of development of distributed systems {{within the context of the}} Internet and WWW. Such systems vary both in design and implementation. Some systems use remote sensed imagery, and in particular satellite imagery, as their primary data source for land-use map construction. It seems, in general, on a rather longer time scale, such systems discard their base imagery, and offer maps and summary tables as their information products. Others FISs make no use of remotely sensed imagery. We ask the question: what FISs use sequences of satellite imagery as a continuing explicit feature of their information offerings, either as a means or adjuct to information display, or a means of re-analysis? A partial review is conducted in relation to this question with the answer “very few”. It is argued and conjectured that any FIS concerned with spatially explicit information, on Forests, the Environment, or land-use in general, which aims to be flexible in terms of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>mapped,</b> which aims to be accurate in estimating and mapping change, and to make forecasts, MUST, in the long term, retain and make adaptive use of historical series of satellite imagery. This conjecture is based on the fact that any map, no matter how good, is just a particular model, calibrated at one time, from the currently available data. Re-analysis and improved modelling with new data demands access to the old raw data! The reviewed FISs are examined in relation to this conjecture. The paper considers some of the problems involved in making use of historical series of satellite imagery, and makes some suggestions on how FISs of the future might make use image-fusion modelling techniques to make the conjecture become a fact. 1...|$|R

Robotics, for instance, aim at answering them for creating successful sensori-motor artefacts. Cognitive sciences use these questions as intermediate goals {{on the road to}} un- derstanding living beings, their skills, and furthermore, their intelligence. Our study lies between these two domains. We first study classical probabilistic ap- proaches (Markov localization, POMDPs, HMMs, etc.), then some biomimetic approaches (Berthoz, Franz, Kuipers). We analyze their respective advantages and drawbacks in light of a general formalism for robot programming based on bayesian inference (BRP). We propose a new probabilistic formalism for modelling the interaction between a robot and its environment : the Bayesian map. In this framework, defining a <b>map</b> <b>is</b> done by specifying a particular probability distri- bution. Some of the questions above then amount to solving inference problems. We define operators for putting maps together, so that " hierarchies of maps " and incremental development {{play a central role in}} our formalism, as in biomimetic approaches. By using the bayesian formalism, we also benefit both from a unified means of dealing with uncertainties, and from clear and rigorous mathematical foundations.

40|$|It is disconcerting to {{note that}} when {{language}} learning processes are considered or discussed, even {{in the wake of}} the 1980 s ELT ‘communicative revolution’, which purportedly advocated firstly the active participation of language learners in the experience of acquiring a foreign or second language, and secondly the practical application of knowledge assimilated during that experience, there is still a tendency to view such processes as somehow passively endured by the learner: Linguistically, one talks of students ‘cramming’, ‘absorbing / taking in facts’, and generally being ‘given’ an education; socially it is not uncommon to find, even today, teaching pursued in the apparent belief that the job of the teacher is to push, or pour, knowledge into an otherwise empty and passive container (Low 1988 : 126). Such a perspective gives rise to a central problem concerning foreign or second language learning and teaching. If we view language as a tool, something which can be used in much the same way, to use an analogy made more than a hundred years ago by the linguist Henry Sweet (1899), as a carpenter uses his or her tools to build a piece of furniture, it should be possible to teach it through practical experience, in much the same way as a carpenter learns his or her trade. However, learning a language has implications which go beyond those of acquiring discrete, quantifiable skills or knowledge. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> acquired <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> onto an already existing identity and language itself can be an extremely powerful tool in defining an individual’s self-image and personality.

Such <b>maps</b> <b>are</b> often used to document understandings of space that contrast with official maps of state understandings of, for example, resources and rights.
