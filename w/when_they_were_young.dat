25|$|Having {{addressed}} the social prejudices against him, Socrates addresses the first accusation — the moral corruption of Athenian youth — by accusing his accuser, Meletus, of being {{indifferent to the}} persons and things about which he professes to care. Whilst interrogating Meletus, Socrates says {{that no one would}} intentionally corrupt another person — because the corrupter later stands to be harmed in vengeance by the corrupted person. The matter of moral corruption is important for two reasons: (i) corruption is the accusation that he (Socrates) corrupted the rich, young men of Athens by teaching atheism; (ii) that if he is convicted of corruption, it will be because the playwright Aristophanes already had corrupted the minds of his audience, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> by lampooning Socrates as the “Sophistical philosopher” in The Clouds, a comic play produced about twenty-four years earlier.|$|E

Duryodhana deeply believed that what was rightfully his was being given away to his older cousin Yudhishthira. He also felt that the Pandavas were sons of Kunti and Gods (devakin), not of Pandu. He never believed that their divine origin alone proved their superiority, on many occasions questioning their merits, and always calling them the 'Kaunteya' (sons of Kunti). He also bore a deep hatred of Bhima, who was his age and dominated his brothers in sport and skill with his immense physical power and strength. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> Bhima's bullying and taunting were a constant source of pain for Duryodhana and his brothers.|$|E
