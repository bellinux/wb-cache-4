He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the <b>well</b> <b>paid</b> job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{workers in}} 3D professions are <b>well</b> <b>paid,</b> {{due to the}} undesirability of the work, and the {{resulting}} need to pay higher wages to attract workers.

This concept proves itself in the economic theory of quantity supplied and quantity demanded (see Quantity adjustment), the wages paid to these workers is higher due to the undesirable nature of their professions.|$|E

Another notable work that Wells handled was the original manuscript for Richard Brinsley Sheridan The School for Scandal. It was eventually sold to the Philadelphia journalist and collector Barton Currie, before 1931, but for less than the $75,000 reported in the press at the time.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1689 the viceroy raised {{funds from}} the {{archbishop}} and the bishops of the colony to send a fleet from the Pacific port of Acapulco in search of pirates marauding in the southern ocean.

25|$|Presented as Beamish Colliery (owned by James Joicey & Co., {{and managed}} by William Severs), the {{colliery}} represents the coal mining industry which dominated the North East for generations - the museum site {{is in the}} former Durham coalfield, where 165,246 men and boys worked in 304 mines in 1913. By the time period represented by Beamish's 1900s era, the industry was booming - production in the Great Northern Coalfield had peaked in 1913, and miners were relatively <b>well</b> <b>paid</b> (double that of agriculture, the next largest employer), but the work was dangerous. Children could be employed from age 12 (the school leaving age), but could not go underground until 14.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} once {{dependent}} on heavy industry such as steel {{making in the}} Derwent Valley and coal mining (across the borough). Shipbuilding on the Tyne was also {{a major source of}} employment. However, with the decline of these industries, Gateshead has attempted to re-invent itself. Although there are significant areas of deprivation in the borough, particularly in the centre and east, a number of towns and villages in the borough are popular with commuters and professionals who are employed in the service industry and <b>well</b> <b>paid</b> areas of secondary industry such as engineering (which remains a major source of employment). Such commuter areas include Ryton, Rowlands Gill, Whickham and Low Fell. The borough is host to Tyne Yard, a major rail freight yard serving the North East.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditionally}} low {{wage differential}} {{has increased in}} recent years as a result of increased flexibility as the role of wage setting at the company level has strengthened somewhat. Still, Swedish unskilled employees are <b>well</b> <b>paid</b> while well educated Swedish employees are low-paid compared with those in competitor countries in Western Europe and the US. The average increases in real wages in recent years have been high by historical standards, in large part due to unforeseen price stability. Even so, nominal wages in recent years have been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-sector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in Sweden, the comparable increase for the EU area was 1.75%. In the year 2000 the total labour force was around 4.4 million people.|$|E

25|$|Singapore had {{problems}} with political corruption. Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families. Lee believed that ministers should be <b>well</b> <b>paid</b> {{in order to maintain}} a clean and honest government. On 21 November 1986, Lee received a complaint of corruption against then Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan. Lee was against corruption and he authorized the CPIB to carry out investigations on Teh but Teh committed suicide before any charges could be pressed against him. In 1994, he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in regions}} where certain classes of workers are {{restricted}} {{to this type of}} work or there are contributing regional conditions - for example, high unemployment, adjacent to regions with high poverty, or the recipient of driven labor migration - there will be workers willing to accept lower than equilibrium wages and then these jobs are not <b>well</b> <b>paid.</b> Large scale international labor migration, from developing to developed countries since the late 19th century and early 20th century has provided a pool of migrants willing to undertake employment for lower wages than native residents. Higher wages in developed countries are a strong 'pull' factor in international migration, and thus while a migrant worker is willing to accept a comparatively low-wage for a 3D job in a developed country it may mean a significant increase in wages compared to their originating country.|$|E
