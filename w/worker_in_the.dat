5|$|The Cripple Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used {{the success of the}} strike to {{organize}} almost every <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cripple Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM flourished in the Cripple Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).|$|E

After the war, the firm concentrated on repair work and antiques restoration. The firm closed in 1990 with the retirement of Sid Russ who had taken the firm over after William Broom retired.|$|E

Georges Poussard, also a <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factory, was appointed as the club's first secretary.

Throughout the 1930s the club continued to grow in size, enlisting more players and members, despite the team performing relatively poorly in the league.|$|E

5|$|Tamagnino's six Caesars were {{relegated to}} the less frequented areas of the {{building}} - at the back and the south and west.

After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably never to return, leaving Cairano as the main sculptural <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} acting {{debut in the}} 2000 war film Refugee, Kapoor {{established}} herself in Hindi cinema with roles in the historical drama Aśoka, and the blockbuster melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (both 2001). This initial success {{was followed by a}} series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against type in the role of a sex <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drama Chameli. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama Dev and a character based on William Shakespeare's heroine Desdemona in the 2006 crime film Omkara. She went on to receive Filmfare Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in the 2007 romantic comedy Jab We Met and the 2010 drama We Are Family, respectively. Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in two of India's top-grossing productions—the 2009 comedy-drama 3 Idiots and the 2015 social drama Bajrangi Bhaijaan—and received praise for her roles in the 2009 thriller Kurbaan and the 2012 drama Heroine.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E

40|$|The Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) {{states that}} <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{informal}} economy can be legally empowered by bringing them {{within the framework}} of effective legal regulation, in particular, international labour standards. This paper acknowledges the value of extending rights to <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal economy, but argues that CLEP's recommendations are impractical and unrealistic. It shows that neither international standards nor recent national legislation designed to promote the legalization of informal enterprises offers unqualified positive answers to resolve <b>the</b> plight of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal economy. Given the poverty of prevailing regulatory structures and the pervasive impact of inadequate structures of governance, <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal economy justifiably distrust legal institutions and, as a consequence, do not, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first instance, resort to legal institutions in their quest for empowerment. This paper offers examples of strategies that have successfully enhanced the social, political and economic power of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal economy. It concludes, however, that although the legal system has a role to play <b>in</b> consolidating <b>the</b> gains achieved by these strategies, law and legal institutions do not necessarily offer the best point of departure towards effectively empowering <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal economy...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of Dawn of Sorrow was announced on January 6, 2005 {{as the first}} Castlevania game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Longtime Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi {{was in charge of}} the production. The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to Aria of Sorrows success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit of both consoles. Igarashi felt that the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel. The original design team from Aria of Sorrow, as well as numerous new additions from Konami Tokyo, was involved in the {{production of}} Dawn of Sorrow. Igarashi intended to include a white collar Japanese <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well.
