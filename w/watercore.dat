50|$|Before {{going to}} market, apples are checked {{and the ones}} showing some defects are removed. However, there are also {{invisible}} defects, that can spoil the apple flavor and look. An example of invisible defect is the <b>watercore.</b> This is an internal apple disorder that can affect the longevity of the fruit. Apples with slight or mild watercores are sweeter, but apples with moderate to severe degree of <b>watercore</b> cannot be stored {{for any length of}} time. Moreover, a few fruits with severe <b>watercore</b> could spoil a whole batch of apples. For this reason, a computational system is under study which takes X-ray photographs of the fruit while they run on conveyor belts, and which is also able to analyse (by data mining techniques) the taken pictures and estimate the probability that the fruit contains watercores.|$|E

This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. Fruit {{with high levels of}} <b>watercore</b> are rejected during market quality control inspections because affected apples can develop alcoholic off-flavours and internal browning symptoms. In 2007 and 2008 late harvest ‘Fuji’ apples with a high incidence of <b>watercore</b> were kept at 1 °C (2008), 3 °C (2007), 6 °C and 10 °C in air. Some fruit at 10 °C were also treated with 1 -MCP and Ethephon. Changes in flesh firmness and <b>watercore</b> were followed during 51 d storage. Fruit at 1, 3 °C and 1 -MCP treated fruit at 10 °C showed no clear change in flesh firmness during 51 d storage while fruit at 6 °C softened between 0. 7 and 0. 9 kg/cm- 2 and untreated fruit at 10 °C lost around 1. 0 kg/cm- 2. <b>Watercore</b> in ‘Fuji’ apples with or without 1 -MCP or Ethephon treatments at 10 °C dissipated to acceptable levels after around 16 to 22 d, while apples at 6, 3 and 1 °C showed acceptable <b>watercore</b> at 26, 29 and 51 d respectively. When ‘Fuji’ apples have high levels of <b>watercore</b> at-harvest, one option is to treat them with 1 -MCP and store at 10 °C. The <b>watercore</b> will reduce rapidly but fruit flesh firmness will generally be maintained at acceptable levels...|$|E
40|$|<b>Watercore</b> is an {{internal}} disorder that appears as water-soaked, glassy regions near the core in apples. Fast and non-destructive solutions for sensing <b>watercore</b> would be readily {{accepted in the}} postharvest industry. X-ray CT and MRI were compared as potential imaging technologies for detecting this particular disorder. After matching the 3 D datasets of X-ray CT and MRI, the images that were obtained on identical fruit were compared quantitatively. Both MRI and CT were able to detect <b>watercore,</b> however the contrast in MRI images was superior. High-resolution micro-CT images showed the microstructural changes in <b>watercore</b> fruit: the intercellular spaces of the affected apple tissue are filled with water. This explained the higher density that is detected here by the X-rays and the higher water content in the MRI. Mean and variance of the frequency distribution of MRI and X-ray CT intensity {{appeared to be a}} parameter that allows the identification of healthy apples from affected fruit. Automatic image processing based on thresholding the images resulted in comparable <b>watercore</b> classification accuracy of up to 89 % for X-ray CT and 79 % for MRI data, despite the better contrast in the MRI images. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the studies on detection of fruit bruises and <b>watercore</b> in their tissues. Both passive and active pulse phase thermography was applied to early detect tissue defect. <b>Watercore</b> occurrence in &# 8216;Gloster&# 8217; apples was evaluated from heating curves. It was found that the derivative of apple temperature in time per apple mass is a good parameter to identify apples with and without <b>watercore.</b> For apples with water-core the rates of temperature increase per mass in particular initial stages of heating were considerably lower than for apples without <b>watercore</b> affected tissue irrespective of the part of the fruit surface from which the measurements were made. Pulsed-phase thermography (PPT) method was used to detect early apple bruises in &# 8216;Idared&# 8217; and &# 8216;Gloster&# 8217;. In PPT method the studied object is heated with an individual thermal pulse (most frequently a rectangular pulse) and the temperature decay on the surface is analysed on a pixel by pixel basis as a mixture of harmonic waves, thus enabling the computation of phase and amplitude images. The analysis of phasegrams made it possible to determine the relation between the frequency response, phase delay and defect depth.

40|$|<b>Watercore</b> {{and sugar}} content are {{internal}} qualities which are impossible for exterior determination. Therefore {{the aims of}} this study were to develop models for nondestructive detection of <b>watercore</b> and predicting sugar content in pear using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) technique. A total of 93 samples of Asian pear variety "SH- 078 " were used. For sugar content, spectrum of each fruit was measured in the short wavelength region (700 – 1100 nm) in the reflection mode and the first derivative of spectra were then correlated with the sugar content in juice determined by digital refractometer. Prediction equation was performed by multiple linear regression. The result showed Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) = 0. 58 °Bx, and Bias= 0. 11. The result from t-test showed that sugar content predicted by NIR was not significantly different from the value analyzed by refractometer at 95 % confidence. For <b>watercore</b> disorder, NIR measurement was performed over the short wavelength range (700 – 850 nm) in the transmission mode. The first derivative spectra were correlated with internal qualities. Then principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) were used to perform discrimination models. The accuracy of the PCA model was greater than the PLSDA one. The scores from PC 1 were separated into two boundaries, one predicted rejected pears with 100 % classification accuracy, and the other was accepted pears with 92 % accuracy. The high accuracy of sugar content determining and <b>watercore</b> detecting by NIR reveal the high efficiency of NIR technique for detecting other internal qualities of fruit in the future...|$|E

They are based on T 2 * and T 2 respectively and their selection depends on the expected contrast effect of the disorder: while <b>watercore</b> enhances bright areas due to higher fluid mobility, internal breakdown potentiates low signal due to texture degradation. For <b>watercore</b> study, five different apple cultivars were used (Normanda- 18 -, Fuji- 35 -, Helada- 36 -, Verde Doncella- 54 -, Esperiega- 75 -) along two seasons (2011 and 2012).

40|$|Pome {{fruit is}} often stored up to 10 {{months at a}} low {{temperature}} (- 0. 5 &# 176; C to 3 &# 176; C), in combination with reduced O 2 and elevated CO 2 partial pressures. Storage at low temperature, combined with 'Controlled Atmosphere' (CA) is used to reduce the respiration activity of the fruit thereby minimising the associated quality changes, and thus extending the storage time. The gas composition is of great importance as physiological defects like internal browning and void formation can occur at suboptimal conditions. Also during the growth phase, various defects can occur, as <b>watercore</b> in apple with hard, glassy zones near the core. A major problem is that these symptoms are not externally observable, and affected fruit cannot be easily distinguished from healthy. Internal fruit quality is typically evaluated based on visual inspection of a randomly selected sample of fruit. Only after cutting the fruit, and thus destroying it, an assessment can be made. When the sampled fruit are affected, the whole batch is rejected and destroyed. The scientific objective of this research project is {{a better understanding of}} the development of the symptoms of internal defects in apple and pear. The technological objective is the development of a non-destructive and rapid image-based method for evaluating internal fruit quality. This should lead to a better sorting of fruit with less losses in the sector and a high, uniform fruit quality on the market as a result. Fruit of Braeburn, Kanzi and Conference were stored under defect-inducing CA conditions through which internally brown and hollow fruit were successfully obtained. Cultivars Ascara, Tempera, Rebellón and Verde doncella were delivered from Spain, where a higher risk of <b>watercore</b> is present because of the climatic conditions. These internal defects are generally characterised by a change in density of the affected tissue. Previous research has shown that X-ray radiography and tomography are particularly suited to detect these internal problems both at the micro- and macroscale. With the help of X-ray micro-CT a large number of fruit samples was scanned such that a complete characterisation of these physiological defects was obtained, in different stages of development, for the different cultivars. Preliminary tests on the whole fruit with X-ray radiography and CT have shown that these technologies are able to detect quality defects in different gradations. Additional high-resolution micro-CT measurements will be performed on tissue pear to complete the microstructural evaluation of internal quality. In an extensive experiment, large numbers of affected and non-affected fruit are scanned so that the detection success of X-ray CT and radiography can be assessed. By fine-tuning measurement conditions and optimise the imaging and processing, this should ultimately lead to the development of a test rig in which affected and healthy fruit are sorted on-line, based on the internal fruit quality. 1 	Introduction	 1 1. 1 	Problem statement	 1 1. 2 	Objectives and outline	 2 1. 3 	References	 3 2 	Essentials of computed tomography and image processing	 5 2. 1

This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. In the present research Time-resolved Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS) technique was tested to detect some internal defects in different apple cultivars. The absorption (μa) and the reduced scattering (μs’) coefficients were measured at different wavelengths in ‘Braeburn’ (mealiness), ‘Granny Smith’ (internal browning) and ‘Fuji’ (<b>watercore)</b> apples. Afterwards, each fruit of ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Fuji’ were cut and evaluated for internal defects. ‘Braeburn’ apples were submitted to sensory analysis (firm, crispy, mealy and juicy), percent juice and relative intercellular space volume (RISV) determinations. In addition, for ‘Granny Smith’, the colour of the pulp was measured. ‘Granny Smith’ sound fruits on average showed μa 750 = 0. 029 cm- 1 and μs’ 750 = 12. 2 cm- 1; {{with the development of}} internal browning, μa 750 increased to values > 0. 04 cm- 1 and μs’ 750 decreased to values < 10 cm- 1 in severely affected fruit. Non-mealy ‘Braeburn’ apples were characterized by significantly lower μs’ 790, μs’ 912 and higher μa 912 than mealy ones. Sensory mealiness was positively related to μs’ 790 and μs’ 912 and negatively to μa 912.

In this study 296 apples (from 4 cultivars) were MRI screened (20 slices per fruit) among which 7 fruits were used for metabolomic study by 1 H HR MAS in order to assess various chemical shifts: malic acid, sucrose, glucose, fructose and ethanol. On the first season, tissue samples were taken from the sound and affected apples (near the core, centre and outer part of the mesocarp) belonging to sound and affected locations, while on the second season, tissue samples were focused on the comparison between sound and affected tissue. Beside, MRI and 2 D non-destructive relaxometry (on whole fruits, and localized tissue) where performed on 72 and 12 apples respectively in order to compare features at macroscopic (tissue) and microscopic (subcellular) level.

Whole fruit firmness and flesh firmness decreased from 34 days after set (DAS) in control melons, while in calcium-deficient fruits, the softening process had begun before day 33 after fruit set, both parameters being significantly lower in these. The activity of b-galactosidase increased during melon ripening, reaching maximum values two days earlier in melons grown with calcium-deficient solutions than in control ones. However, no PG activity was detected in control melons, but this activity increased during ripening in melons grown with low and removed calcium solutions, a fact that positively correlated with decreased fruit firmness. Ethylene production rate increased sharply as fruit ripened, which could be responsible for the increase in b-galactosidase activity and so for fruit softening.

40|$|Development of {{disorders}} during postharvest ripening {{and storage}} of fruit {{depends on a}} range of preharvest factors. The most obvious of these is maturity of fruit at harvest. However, a number of other factors may be just as important in ripening-related disorders and in determining how fruit respond to low temperatures or other imposed postharvest conditions. Fruiting position on the tree and fruit temperature history are two of {{the most important of these}} factors. In apples, position strongly influences fruit mineral contents, and consequently incidence of postharvest disorders such as bitter pit. This positional effect may reflect pollination and cropping effects, or more direct differences in flow of minerals and water into developing fruit. In both apples and avocado fruit, we have shown that high temperatures experienced by fruit on the tree can influence the response of those fruit to low and high postharvest temperatures. Specific disorders such as <b>watercore</b> in apples and chilling injury in avocado can also be related to fruit exposure to sunlight and high temperatures; disorders such as scald in apples may be related to frequency of low temperature exposure over the season. Identification of preharvest factors raises the possibility of producing fruit with less predisposition to postharvest disorders. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene is a {{plant hormone}} that regulates {{climacteric}} fruit ripening. Ethylene gas diffuses from fruit cells and tissues and can affect other fruit. Low temperature and controlled atmospheres (CA) with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide reduce ethylene production and action, {{as well as}} slowing ripening and loss of optimum fruit quality. MCP (1 -methylcyclopropene) is a new tool {{for the management of}} ethylene action/production by climacteric fruit including apple. This compound is an ethylene action inhibitor that prevents plant tissues from responding to ethylene by combining with ethylene receptors (Sisler and Blankenship, 1996; Sisler and Serek, 1997). MCP gas applied at harvest delays ripening, improves storage life and prevents superficial scald and other physiological disorders in many apple cultivars including Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala (Fan et al., 1999 a, Fan et al., 1999 b). For many cultivars, treatment with MCP is most effective when fruit are harvested at CA maturity and MCP is applied soon after harvest. Fuji and Braeburn apples fruit are susceptible to internal browning caused by exposure to high CO 2 during storage (Elgar, et al., 1998, Argenta et al., 2000). Factors contributing to development of CO 2 injury in these cultivars include maturity at harvest, <b>watercore,</b> CO 2 concentration in storage, and the duration between harvest and imposition of CA conditions...|$|E
3000|$|Agriculture {{is seen as}} a major {{vulnerable}} {{sector to}} climate change in Romania, as recognized within the Romanian National Climate Change Strategy (2013 – 2020), in its Adaptation component, which will be followed by an action plan at sectoral level. There are several studies estimating the potential impact of climate change on the Romanian agriculture (Cuculeanu et al. 1999; Mateescu et al. 2003; Mateescu and Alexandru 2010; Sandu et al. 2010). However, their focus is mostly centered on climatic aspects. There is still a need to strengthen the interdisciplinary cooperation and to involve agro-specialists in developing adaptation strategies, by considering the differentiations between agro-climate zones in correlation to different adaptive capacities and adaptation options for farmers at local level. The topic of agriculture and climate change adaptation in Romania was included recently in several European projects, which address the main climate change challenges and related risks for agriculture in different parts of Romania (e.g. the SEE Orientgate project, 2012 - 2014, focused on Covasna County and Oltenia Plain and [...] Interreg IVC <b>WaterCore</b> project, 2010 - 2013) (National Meteorological Administration 2014). Although it is considered that farmers in Europe are largely adapted to the local climate (Reidsma et al. 2007), when considering the cumulated effects of climate change, most regions of Europe are expected to suffer from their negative effects. This appears to be also the case for Romania, included in the Pannonian zone, strongly affected in this respect (Olesen et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the yield and fruit quality of apple produced with a conventional and an organic production systems in Southern Brazil. The orchards consisted of alternate rows from 10 to 12 -year old 'Royal Gala' and 'Fuji' apple trees on M. 7 rootstocks, grown as slender spindles, on 4 x 6 m spacing. Eighteen apple trees of each cultivar and management system were randomly selected and assessed for nutrition, flowering, fruit set, yield, and fruit quality during two growing seasons (2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004). The organic management system resulted in lower concentrations of K, Mg, and N in leaves and fruits, and in smaller fruits for both cultivars, and lower fruit yield for 'Fuji' than from the conventional production system. For both cultivars, fruits from the organic orchard harvested at commercial maturity had a more yellowish skin background color, higher percentage of blush in the fruit skin, higher soluble solids content, higher density, higher flesh firmness, and higher severity of russet than fruits from the conventional orchard. Fruit from the organic orchard had lower titratable acidity in 'Royal Gala', and higher incidence of moldy core and lower incidence of <b>watercore</b> in 'Fuji', than fruit from the conventional orchard. A non-trained sensory panel detected no significant differences for fruit attributes of taste, flavor and texture between fruit from the production systems for either cultivar. 200...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the International Conference “Environmentally {{friendly}} and safe technologies for quality {{of fruit and}} vegetables”, held in Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal, on January 14 - 16, 2009. This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. Internal disorders in horticultural products are not revealed by external visual symptoms. Non-destructive and non-invasive monitoring techniques are required to detect the occurrence and investigate development of internal disorders. X-ray CT allows visualization and analysis of plant materials with a resolution down to a few micrometers, and without sample preparation or chemical fixation. X-ray tomography is based on X-ray radiography: an X-ray beam is sent on a sample and the transmitted beam is recorded on a detector. The level of transmission of these rays depends mainly on the mass density and mass absorption coefficient of the material. The resulting image is superimposed information (a projection) of a volume in a 2 D plane. The classical way to retrieve 3 D information is to perform {{a large number of}} radiographs while rotating the sample between 0 ° and 180 °. The filtered back-projection algorithm can then be used to reconstruct the volume of the sample from these radiographs. Compared to two-dimensional radiography used in medicine and linescan radiography applied on grading machines, X-ray computer tomography (CT) is the most powerful technique from the horticultural research point of view, since two and three dimensional images can be reconstructed from the accumulated data to study internal physical and physiological processes. Most internal disorders like woolliness in nectarines, hollow heart in potato, core breakdown in pears, <b>watercore</b> in apples and spongy tissue in mango affect the density and water content of the internal tissue and, hence, are detectable by means of X-ray measurements. For in vivo observations, high resolution submicron tomography has up to recently only been achieved on relatively dry -or hard- biological samples, such as plant seeds. We have shown, however, that by means of synchrotron radiation X-ray sources, it has now become feasible to image plant tissues at a resolution of less than one micrometer...|$|E
