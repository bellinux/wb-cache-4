5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

Claire and Julia are the rebels, the failures, the embarrassments that must be tolerated. When Julia arrives home, Claire greets her more honestly, more warmly than do Julia’s parents.|$|E

25|$|A second son, Henry Charles Albert David, {{was born}} on 15 September 1984. The Princess {{asserted}} she and the Prince were closest during her pregnancy with Harry (as the younger prince has always been known). She was aware their second child was a boy, but did not share the knowledge <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else,</b> including the Prince of Wales. Suggestions that Harry's father is not Charles but James Hewitt, with whom Diana had an affair, are based on alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry; however, Harry was born before the affair began.|$|E

She lies {{to him that}} she slept with someone else {{a few months ago}} to see if he will confess, but he says he has not been <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Later, she seduces him in Fatboy's van but throws him out in his underwear, humiliating him. She says goodbye to Shirley and leaves Walford for France in the van.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{relations}} between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch {{appear to have been}} initially untroubled, an impression which is reinforced by the choice (806/807) of Theodore's brother, Joseph, as Archbishop of Thesaloniki. However, soon after this ordination, perhaps in 808, Theodore began to express his unwillingness to associate with the rehabilitated priest Joseph, or for that matter <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> who knowingly associated with him, as he held the rehabilitation for uncanonical. As in the first dispute over the priest Joseph, the extension of this refusal beyond Joseph to those who associated with him included implicitly the patriarch and the emperor himself.|$|E

25|$|While {{working at}} a Centreville Italian restaurant, she met Ronald Roldan, a Bolivian {{immigrant}} then around 30, and began an extramarital affair with him, possibly because he offered to help her with babysitting. By late 2010, the Deckers' marriage had begun to suffer; Bethany moved to a separate apartment in Ashburn, Virginia, at least temporarily. Roldan soon followed. According to her family, she quickly {{found that he was}} abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she send him a picture of herself from her cellphone to prove that she was not <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Her parents began developing a plan {{to get her out of}} the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant again, likely by Roldan.|$|E
25|$|In February, 1885, Garrett and Oldham County Sheriff Jim East {{learned that}} three of the holdouts, those who refused to leave the Panhandle, were hiding out at the Howry Cattle Company headquarters. Riding all night through a snowstorm, they reached the house in which the cowboys were {{believed}} to be located. Cowboy Bob Bassett was outside the house gathering firewood, and spotted the posse, alerting the others. Tom Harris then yelled out to Garrett as to what his business was, to which Garrett announced he had warrants for Woods, Bogan and Thompson, but had no issues <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Nine cowboys then filed from the house, leaving only Thompson and Bogan inside. Woods was not present. Bogan and Woods, however, refused to surrender, and a shootout erupted, during which Bogan was able to make his escape, while Woods was killed. Three posse members were wounded during the exchange.|$|E

A live version was included on the album Vivo (2000), and the original recording was included on the compilation album Grandes Éxitos (2005).|$|E
500|$|The defence {{maintained}} that the witnesses who said Bamber disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words. Mugford had lied about Bamber's confession, they said, because he had betrayed her, {{and she wanted to}} stop him from being <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> No one had seen Bamber cycle to and from the farm. There were no marks on him on the night that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killing and since.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown me {{a lot of things that}} I haven't done in the past. In seven years, I have been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else,</b> so I just feel it was a good dedication for him."

500|$|The 32-year-old White, who {{had been}} in the Army during the Vietnam War, had run on a tough anti-crime {{platform}} in his district.

He was to have received an award the next week for rescuing a woman and child from a 17-story burning building when he was a firefighter in 1977. Though he was the only supervisor to vote against Milk's gay rights ordinance earlier that year, he had been quoted as saying, [...] "I respect the rights of all people, including gays". Milk and White at first got along well. One of White's political aides (who was gay) remembered, [...] "Dan had more in common with Harvey than he did <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> on the board". White had voted to support a center for gay seniors, and to honor Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin's 25th anniversary and pioneering work.|$|E
500|$|After No Man's Land, Richardson {{once again}} turned to light comedy by Douglas-Home, {{from whom he}} {{commissioned}} The Kingfisher. A story of an old love affair rekindled, it opened with Celia Johnson as the female lead. It ran for six months, and would have lasted much longer had Johnson not withdrawn, leaving Richardson unwilling to rehearse the piece <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> He returned to the National, and to Chekhov, in 1978 as the aged retainer Firs in The Cherry Orchard. The notices for the production were mixed; those for Richardson's next West End play were uniformly dreadful. This was Alice's Boys, a spy and murder piece generally agreed to be preposterous. A legend, possibly apocryphal, grew that during the short run Richardson walked {{to the front of}} the stage one night and asked, [...] "Is there a doctor in the house?" [...] A doctor stood up, and Richardson sadly said to him, [...] "Doctor, isn't this a terrible play?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{discussion}} of Genesis 25:1–6 in the Genesis Rabbah includes statements by Rabbi Yehuda ha-Nasi arguing that Hagar returned to Abraham and was renamed Keturah. [...] Her new name (Keturah means incense in Hebrew) {{is said to}} refer to the pleasant aroma of incense—symbolic of her having turned from misdeeds committed during her time away from Abraham. Since Keturah is referred to in First Chronicles as Abraham's concubine (in the singular), some scholars concluded that this was why Keturah was identified with Hagar in the Midrash and the Palestinian Targumim. [...] An alternative interpretation of the name Keturah (based on an Aramaic root meaning [...] "to tie" [...] or [...] "to adorn") is also cited in the Genesis Rabbah to suggest that Hagar did not have sexual relations <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> from the time she left Abraham until her return. [...] The theory that Keturah was Hagar was also supported by the 11th-century scholar Rashi.|$|E
5000|$|Hoffman {{had worked}} at the New York Psychiatric Institute, {{affiliated}} with Columbia University, when he was 21. [...] "It was a great experience for me," [...] he has said.

All the things {{the rest of us}} were feeling and stopping up were coming out of these people." [...] He used that experience to help him develop the character of Raymond Babbitt, a high-functioning autistic savant, yet a person who critic David Denby described as [...] "a strangely shuttered genius." [...] Hoffman created certain character traits for Raymond. Denby noted: [...] "Hoffman, looking suddenly older and smaller, has developed a small shuffling walk for Raymond, with shoulder bent. His eyes don't make contact <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's,</b> and he flattens his voice to a dry nasal bark." ...|$|R
40|$|The urban {{transit routing}} problem (UTRP) {{involves}} finding efficient routes {{in a public}} transport system. However, developing effective heuristics and metaheuristics for the UTRP is hugely challenging because of the vast search space and multiple constraints that make even the attainment of feasible results exceedingly difficult, as the problem size increases. Moreover, progress with academic research on the UTRP appears to be seriously hampered by: 1) a lack of benchmark data, and 2) the complex and diverse range of methods used in the literature to evaluate solution quality. It is not currently possible for researchers to effectively compare {{the performance of their}} algorithms <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's.</b> This paper presents new problem-specific genetic operators within a multi-objective evolutionary framework, and furthermore proposes an effective and efficient heuristic method for seeding the population with feasible route sets. In addition new data sets are provided and made available for download, to aid future researchers. Excellent results are presented for Mandl's problem, which is currently the only benchmark available, while the results obtained for the new data sets provide a challenge for future researchers to beat...|$|R

500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Annie held a monthly DJ night called Pop Till You Drop with friend Frøken Blytt in her {{hometown}} of Bergen, Norway. There she met producer Tore Kroknes, and the two began dating. Annie and Kroknes borrowed a small studio from downtempo duo Röyksopp to record her debut single [...] "The Greatest Hit". The song, which uses a sample of Madonna's 1982 dance-pop single [...] "Everybody", had a limited edition release in 1999. It became an underground hit at clubs in Norway and Britain, resulting in offers for record deals. The two recorded Annie's second single, titled [...] "I Will Get On". She focused on vocals and melodies in music, and Kroknes concentrated on production, influenced by techno, disco and house music. As she began to work on her debut album, Kroknes became ill due to a heart defect. He died eighteen months later, in April 2001. Because of their plan to make the album together, Annie struggled with the idea of collaborating <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> and stopped work on it entirely.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|At the Met {{premiere in}} February 2011, {{although}} the audience—which included Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon Cox—gave the work a warm reception, critical {{approval of the}} production was not uniform. Robert Hofler of Variety criticized Sellars for using body microphones to amplify the singing, thus compensating for the [...] "vocally distressed" [...] Maddalena. He further complained that the director, known for designing unorthodox settings for the operas he has staged (Hofler mentions The Marriage of Figaro in the New York Trump Tower and Don Giovanni in an urban slum), here uses visually uninteresting, overly realistic sets {{for the first two}} acts. Hofler felt that it was time that the opera received a fresh approach: [...] "Having finally arrived at the Met, Nixon in China has traveled the world. It is a masterpiece, a staple of the opera repertory, and now it simply deserves a new look". However, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, while noting that Maddalena's voice was not as strong as it had been at the world premiere, maintained that due to his long association with the role, it would have been impossible to bring the opera to the Met <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> as Nixon: [...] "Maddalena inhabits the character like no other singer". Tommasini also praised the performance of Robert Brubaker in the role of Mao, [...] "captur the chairman's authoritarian defiance and rapacious self-indulgence", and found the British soprano Janis Kelly [...] "wonderful" [...] as Pat Nixon.|$|E
