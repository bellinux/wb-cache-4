5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a <b>winner-takes-all</b> system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E
5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the <b>winner-takes-all</b> prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E
25|$|The {{final day}} of the 34th America's Cup brought only the third <b>winner-takes-all</b> match in Cup history (previous such matches had {{occurred}} in 1920 and 1983). Barker and Spithill have also both moved into the top 5 all time America's Cup skippers during this regatta.|$|E
25|$|It {{was agreed}} before the series that {{one half of}} total gate {{receipts}} would be distributed among the players, with the victors receiving the spoils on a <b>winner-takes-all</b> basis. All receipts were put into the bank in a joint account held by the team owners, with no disbursal of funds to take place until one team had won a majority of games in the 7-game series. A similar <b>winner-takes-all</b> allocation of {{the other half of}} the proceeds was made by the respective teams' owners. Total receipts for the series were $13,920.10, from which was first deducted the $100 salaries of the umpires and team travel expenses. The remaining funds were split in half between Browns players and team owner Chris Von der Ahe, with each player taking home slightly over $500.|$|E
25|$|Arguments between proponents {{and opponents}} of the current electoral system include four {{separate}} but related topics: indirect election, disproportionate voting power by some states, the <b>winner-takes-all</b> distribution method (as chosen by 48 of the 50 states), and federalism. Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion focus mostly on the allocation of the voting power among the states. Gary Bugh's research of congressional debates over proposed constitutional amendments to abolish the Electoral College reveals reform opponents have often appealed to a traditional version of representation, whereas reform advocates have tended to reference a more democratic view.|$|E
25|$|Building binary {{classifiers}} which distinguish (i) {{between one}} of the labels and the rest (one-versus-all) or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification of new instances for the one-versus-all case is done by a <b>winner-takes-all</b> strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns the class (it {{is important that the}} output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores). For the one-versus-one approach, classification is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns the instance to {{one of the}} two classes, then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of the Electoral College claim such {{outcomes}} do not logically {{follow the}} normative concept {{of how a}} democratic system should function. One view is the Electoral College violates the principle of political equality, since presidential elections are not decided by the one-person one-vote principle. Outcomes of this sort are attributable to the federal nature of the system. Supporters of the Electoral College argue candidates must build a popular base that is geographically broader and more diverse in voter interests than either a simple national plurality or majority. Neither is this feature attributable to having intermediate elections of presidents, caused instead by the <b>winner-takes-all</b> method of allocating each state's slate of electors. Allocation of electors {{in proportion to the}} state's popular vote could reduce this effect.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his poor}} {{form in the}} {{previous}} season's Stanford Twenty20, Pollard was named {{as part of the}} initial 32-member Stanford Superstars Twenty20 squad. The squad would provide the starters for the US$20 million <b>winner-takes-all</b> match against England later in the year. After a series of practice matches, Pollard was included in the team for the warm-up match against his Trinidad and Tobago side, where he made 24runs off 14balls and claimed the wicket of captain Daren Ganga. He followed this up with a nine-ball 27 against Middlesex, including three consecutive sixes in the last over. In the final, Pollard claimed the wickets of Andrew Flintoff and Luke Wright to help limit England to a total of 99, which Super Stars openers Chris Gayle and Andre Fletcher chased down in 12.4 overs.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Republicans in Pennsylvania, who {{controlled}} {{both houses of}} the legislature {{as well as the}} governorship, put forward a plan to change the state's <b>winner-takes-all</b> system to a congressional district method system. Pennsylvania had voted for the Democratic candidate in the five previous presidential elections, so some saw this as an attempt to take away Democratic electoral votes. Although Democrat Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008, he won only 55% of Pennsylvania's popular vote. The district plan would have awarded him 11 of its 21 electoral votes, a 52.4% that is closer to the popular vote yet still overcoming Republican gerrymandering. The plan later lost support. Other Republicans, including Michigan state representative Pete Lund, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have floated similar ideas.|$|E
25|$|The congressional {{district}} method allows a state {{the chance to}} split its electoral votes between multiple candidates. Prior to 2008, neither Maine nor Nebraska had ever split their electoral votes. Nebraska split its electoral votes {{for the first time}} in 2008, giving John McCain its statewide electors and those of two {{congressional district}}s, while Barack Obama won the electoral vote of Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. Following the 2008 split, some Nebraska Republicans made efforts to discard the congressional district method and return to the <b>winner-takes-all</b> system. In January 2010, a bill was introduced in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a winner-take-all system; the bill died in committee in March 2011. Republicans had also passed bills in 1995 and 1997 to eliminate the congressional district method in Nebraska, but those bills were vetoed by Democratic Governor Ben Nelson.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the short ballot in the early 20th century, as {{described}} above, the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the general ticket. The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or <b>winner-takes-all</b> voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932. Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 {{and was one of the}} last states to switch to the short ballot.|$|E
2500|$|The congressional {{district}} method {{can more easily}} be implemented than other alternatives to the <b>winner-takes-all</b> method, in view of major party resistance to relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method. State legislation is sufficient to use this method. Advocates of the {{congressional district}} method believe the system would encourage higher voter turnout and incentivize presidential candidates to broaden their campaigns in non-competitive states. Winner-take-all systems ignore thousands of popular votes; in Democratic California there are Republican districts, in Republican Texas there are Democratic districts. Because candidates {{have an incentive to}} campaign in competitive districts, with a district plan, candidates have an incentive to actively campaign in over thirty states versus seven [...] "swing" [...] states. Opponents of the system, however, argue candidates might only spend time in certain battleground districts instead of the entire state and cases of gerrymandering could become exacerbated as political parties attempt to draw as many safe districts as they can.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion that}} the entire {{campaign}} amounts to {{nothing more than a}} [...] "political purge" [...] has been advanced in Western media outlets. British news magazine The Economist wrote in its [...] "Banyan" [...] column, [...] "it is hard not to see corruption allegations as the latter-day weapon of choice in the <b>winner-takes-all</b> power struggles that the party has always suffered". Meanwhile, He Pin, editor at overseas Chinese news portal Boxun, likened Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Ling Jihua, and Xu Caihou, to a latter-day [...] "Gang of Four", whose real crime was not corruption but conspiring to usurp power. Chinese writer Murong Xuecun, a continual critic of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an opinion article [...] "In my view, Xi's anti-corruption campaign looks more like a Stalinist political purge... he relies on the regulations of the party and not on the laws of the state, the people carrying it out operate like the KGB, and most cases cannot be reported on with any transparency." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 1985 World Championship, Davis dropped only 23 frames {{en route}} to the final, where his {{opponent}} was Dennis Taylor. He looked set for a third consecutive world title after an opening session of near-faultless snooker gave him a 7–0 lead, which he extended to 8–0 in the evening session, but Taylor recovered to trail only 7–9. From 11–11 the pair traded frames before Davis forged ahead to lead 17–15. Taylor won the next two frames to level the match at 17–17 and force a deciding frame. With the scores close, Taylor potted the final colours to leave the black as the <b>winner-takes-all</b> ball. After a series of safety shots and attempts at potting it, Davis over-cut the black, leaving Taylor with a reasonably straightforward pot to secure the championship. The nailbiting finale drew 18.5million viewers, a record post-midnight audience on British television and a record audience for BBC Two. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
2500|$|According to this criticism, the Electoral College {{encourages}} political campaigners {{to focus}} on a few so-called [...] "swing states" [...] while ignoring the rest of the country. Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers and debates, while [...] "four out of five" [...] voters in the national election are [...] "absolutely ignored", according to one assessment. Since most states use a <b>winner-takes-all</b> arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida in 2004 and 2008, and also Colorado in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as California, Texas, and New York, have in recent elections been considered [...] "safe" [...] for a particular party—Democratic for California and New York and Republican for Texas—and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be [...] "safe" [...] for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic George C. Edwards III. In the 2008 election, campaigns did not mount nationwide efforts but rather focused on select states.|$|E
2500|$|Kane turned {{face when}} he {{reformed}} his alliance with The Undertaker immediately before the Royal Rumble, in which he eliminated a then-record number of 11 wrestlers and was the runner-up, after being eliminated by Steve Austin. In early 2001, Kane competed for the Hardcore Championship, defeating Raven for the title at WrestleMania X-Seven in a match that also featured Big Show. Kane and The Undertaker began teaming as the [...] "Brothers of Destruction" [...] {{and in the course}} of the year, they feuded with Edge and Christian, Rikishi and Haku, and The Two-Man Power Trip. While feuding with The Two-Man Power Trip, Austin and Triple H broke Kane's left arm. At Judgment Day, Kane defeated Triple H to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. He became the third Grand Slam Champion, and the first person to win the Grand Slam championship by winning the WWF, Intercontinental, Tag Team and Hardcore Championships. He lost the title to Albert on an episode of SmackDown!, following interference from Diamond Dallas Page. During The Invasion, Kane and The Undertaker feuded with DDP and Chris Kanyon after Page began stalking The Undertaker's wife Sara. The feud culminated at SummerSlam, when Kane and The Undertaker defeated Page and Kanyon in a steel cage match, resulting in them holding both the WWF Tag Team and the WCW Tag Team Championships. Kane and The Undertaker defeated KroniK at Unforgiven, and both participated in the ten-man <b>Winner-Takes-All</b> match at Survivor Series as members of the victorious Team WWF.|$|E
