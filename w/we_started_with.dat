[...] demonstrates that in conferring an honor, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the most important person, for when Moses instructed Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar {{that they should not}} conduct themselves as mourners, Moses spoke first to Aaron and only thereafter to Aaron's sons Eleazar and Ithamar. And [...] demonstrates that in conferring a curse, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the least important, for God cursed the serpent first, and only thereafter cursed Eve and then Adam.|$|R

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we can see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E

Topolski, who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1967 race, had coached Oxford to ten consecutive victories from 1976 to 1985. He noted: [...] "We know we are underdogs. [...] <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> only one man from a previous Blues race and no internationals. [...] Nothing but big hearts and lungs". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Richard Phelps was upbeat: [...] "We're buoyant, tails up, the boat's been going fast."

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Alonso said the Grand Prix was [...] "one of the best races of the year" [...] for the Ferrari team and that the wet weather conditions made the victory more difficult; [...] "I think it's {{one of the most}} tricky conditions' victories I've ever had, probably, because <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> very extreme conditions, red flag, then a couple of laps behind the safety car". Alonso said he would not be changing his approach to driving in the final two rounds of the season. Hamilton said finishing in second was [...] "a great result" [...] and that he was [...] "very happy". He also said he lost time to his rivals in the final sector of the track because of problems with his brakes. Massa said that despite the poor visibility he endured he was happy to finish third. He also said he struggled with his rear tyres, which caused him to run more slowly than the drivers in front of him.|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles." [...] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. [...] "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show," [...] he said, and elaborated: ...|$|E

[...] Prior to rehearsals, the scripts are sent to a [...] "swearing consultant" [...] in Lancaster called Ian Martin, who adds some of the more colourful language. The programme's producer is Adam Tandy, who has produced all of Iannucci's television projects since 2000. The programme is shot with hand-held cameras to give it a sense of vérité or fly-on-the-wall documentary. The documentary style is furthered by the absence of any incidental music or laughter track.|$|E
