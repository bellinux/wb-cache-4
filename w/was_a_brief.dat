5|$|After {{the death}} of Vladimir Lenin in January 1924, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> power {{struggle}} in the Soviet Union, from which Joseph Stalin rose to take the reins of power. Armenian society and its economy were changed by Stalin and his fellow Moscow policymakers. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} {{has never been}} shown on U.S. television, its three parts were shown on 26 February 2005 {{as part of the}} True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, with a {{personal}} appearance made by Curtis.

5|$|As U.S. troop {{withdrawals}} continued, conscription {{was reduced}} and in 1973 ended; {{the armed forces}} became all-volunteer. After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed {{at the beginning of}} 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the 160,000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw. Once American combat support ended, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> truce, before fighting broke out again. North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the reorganization of the department of entomology these classes have since ceased.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{motion picture}} debut <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> {{appearance}} as The Scorpion King {{in the opening}} sequence of The Mummy Returns. The character appears in the movie's climax in CGI form. The movie's financial success led to Johnson's first leading role, in the spin-off The Scorpion King. He received US$5.5 million for the role and was listed in the 2007 Guinness World Records as the highest-paid actor in his first starring role. The Mummy Returns, featuring The Rock, shattered a two-year record by earning $28,594,667, the highest-grossing single day for any film in history.|$|E

A local election was also held in Romblon town for its ministers of justice and barrio officials.

5|$|Since the band's foundation, Devourment {{released}} a demo, Impaled, and an album, Molesting the Decapitated, before disbanding {{due to the}} jailing of vocalist Ruben Rosas. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> reformation of the band during his incarceration, which saw the initial release of the compilation album 1.3.8., and a brief reformation upon his release in 2002. The band reformed {{for a third time}} in 2005, and has since released two reissues of 1.3.8., two DVDs, and three full-length albums: Butcher the Weak, Unleash the Carnivore, and Conceived in Sewage.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> one. Rovers were {{knocked out}} in the first round by Luton Town on penalty kicks after drawing the match 1–1. The FA Cup was more successful, with the team reaching the fourth round where they were beaten 1–0 by Derby County. The best cup run of the season was in the Football League Trophy, where they reached the final after beating rivals Bristol City 1–0 in the southern area final. The game was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but resulted in a 3–2 defeat after extra time, the score being 2–2 after 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> {{conflict}} that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E
5|$|The strikebreakers were escorted out of {{the city}} by the National Guard on November 8. They left by train to return to Chicago. The same day, the {{employees}} returned to work and normal operations resumed. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> disturbance when pro-union employees refused to work on cars with non-union employees. Ralston immediately interceded in the dispute, and threatened to use the National Guard to run the streetcars until the Indiana Public Service Commission could resolve the dispute. The employees dropped their objections and returned to work. The National Guard remained in the city until November 9 without incident. They demobilized on November 10.|$|E
5|$|Their time in Rome <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> two days, {{during which}} Kalākaua, Armstrong, and Judd were granted an {{audience}} with Pope Leo XIII on July 3.

The party traveled across France and Paris without informing the French authorities, which {{was seen as a}} breach of official protocol and had to be explained at a later date.|$|E

5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> {{period when}} the episode had a {{different}} subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening {{had been told by}} a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to Camberwell from Elephant & Castle was planned and approved in 1931. Elephant & Castle was {{also to be}} reconstructed with a third platform to provide the additional reversing capacity, along with a new ticket hall and escalators. Due {{to the need to}} prioritise the extension from Baker Street to Finchley Road, to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line, as well as financial constraints and the outbreak of the Second World War, no work was carried out on the extension. In the 1950s there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> revival of the plan, in which it was proposed that Elephant & Castle would not be altered and the additional turn-round capacity would be provided by making Camberwell a three-platform terminus. The project was ultimately unaffordable owing to post-war austerity, reduced demand, and the disproportionately high cost of the project with a three-platform deep-level terminus and the requirement for new trains and a depot.|$|E
5|$|Mindful of the {{enormous}} success of the Philharmonia Chorus, founded in 1957 by Legge to work with his Philharmonia Orchestra, the LSO decided to establish its own chorus. The LSO Chorus (later called the London Symphony Chorus) was formed in 1966 under John Alldis as chorus master. Its early years were difficult; Kertész did not get on with Alldis, and there were difficulties within the chorus. Most of its members were amateurs, but at first, they were reinforced by {{a small number of}} professionals. This led to disputes over the balance between amateurs and professionals. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> crisis, after which the professional element was removed, and the LSO chorus became, and remains, an outstanding amateur chorus.|$|E

5|$|On 24 December Brilliant and Coventry {{encountered}} {{their second}} privateer, the 24-gun Le Dragon. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> exchange of fire in which four French sailors {{were killed and}} up to 12 wounded, against six wounded men aboard Coventry. After the outgunned French vessel struck her colours the British took her surviving 280 crew prisoner. On the following day a third French ship hove into view, the Intrepid, a 14-gun snow-rigged privateer. After a short chase she fell within range of Brilliants guns; the French fired first, wounding one British sailor. The responding broadside from Brilliant capsized Intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120. The survivors were taken prisoner aboard Brilliant and handed over to British authorities at Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, {{a bridge}} at Wairopi was {{destroyed}} by the withdrawing PIB troops who had been reinforced by a platoon of Australians from the 39th Infantry Battalion. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> fire-fight on 24 July, before the Japanese began forcing a crossing of the Kumusi River in rubber assault boats supported by mortars and machine gun fire. In the days that followed, skirmishes were fought around Gorari and at Oivi, before the Australians and Papuans were forced back to Deniki. From there, a small force was sent north to Kokoda, {{with the intent of}} holding the village and its logistically important airfield. Over the course of a fortnight, two important engagements were fought around Kokoda in late July and early August. This was followed by a short but sharp engagement around Deniki before the Australians withdrew towards Isurava on 14 August. In the short lull that followed, the Japanese began landing the main body of Horii's South Seas Detachment on the northern coast, while minor patrol actions resulted in several skirmishes north of Isurava.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
