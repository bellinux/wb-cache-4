25|$|So, {{instead of}} proving that all {{positive}} integers {{eventually lead to}} 1, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to prove that 1 leads to all positive integers. For any integer n, n ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff 3n+1≡4(mod6). Equivalently, (n−1)/3≡1(mod2) iff n≡4(mod6). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 1–4–2 loop of the unaltered function f defined in the Statement of the problem section of this article).|$|E
25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E

In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Dr Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10percent of the island's population directly or indirectly: [...] "We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income.

[...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results.

In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{manifold}} is 4 dimensional, {{this does}} not work: {{the problem is that}} a disc in general position may have double points where two points of the disc have the same image. This is the main reason why the usual proof of the h-cobordism theorem only works for cobordisms whose boundary has dimension at least 5. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to get rid of these double points as follows. Draw a line on the disc joining two points with the same image. If the image of this line is the boundary of an embedded disc (called a Whitney disc), then it is easy to remove the double point. However this argument seems to be going round in circles: in order to eliminate a double point of the first disc, we need to construct a second embedded disc, whose construction involves exactly the same problem of eliminating double points.|$|E

Norwegian National Deputy Rune Fagerli, the country's sole representative on the Joint Strike Fighter program, told SPACE.com that the Norwegian Royal Ministry of Defence has pledged $125 million in preparation to replace a fleet of F-16 jets that have about 12 years left of operation. [...] "By getting involved here on the ground level, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> and address the needs of Norway into this capable fighter early," [...] said Fagerli, a colonel. For example, Norwegian F-16s are fitted with drag chutes because of wet, slippery runways. Likewise, international cooperation to aircraft development could also yield aircraft from cooperating nations that fit well together during combat. Fagerli also mentioned that Norwegian pilots currently fly missions over Afghanistan in F-16s alongside Danish and Dutch aviators.|$|E

2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature.

[...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very difficult for us to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
