5|$|By late 1957, due to {{the prior}} {{expulsion}} of foreign clergy and the subsequent imprisonment of Chinese clergy, 120 out of 145 dioceses and prefectures apostolic were without ordinaries. The Diocese of Qingdao <b>went</b> <b>without</b> an ordinary until the state-run Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association consecrated and appointed Bishop Paul Han Xirang, OFM without papal sanction in 1988.|$|E

These usually <b>went</b> <b>without</b> incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked them why they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E

5|$|Brown's form {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and <b>went</b> <b>without</b> victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out {{and in the}} other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.|$|E
5|$|The city's longest-operating {{baseball}} team, {{first known}} as only the Nashville Baseball Club and later nicknamed the Nashville Vols (short for Volunteers), {{was formed in}} 1901 as a charter member of the Southern Association. They remained in the league through 1961, winning eight pennants, nine playoff championships, and four Dixie Series titles. The league disbanded after the 1961 season, and no team was fielded in 1962, but the Vols played one final season in the South Atlantic League in 1963. Sulphur Dell was demolished in 1969, and the city <b>went</b> <b>without</b> a professional team for 14 years until 1978.|$|E
5|$|Tie {{games were}} once {{frequent}} in the NFL between its inaugural season in 1920 to 1973, when the league {{did not have}} overtime during the regular season. Games that were tied after regulation (60 minutes, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes) immediately ended. During this period, the NFL had a total of 258 tied games. Only three seasons (1934, 1950, 1952) <b>went</b> <b>without</b> a tied game, while five seasons (1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1932) had at least ten ties. The most ties, 17, occurred in the 1920 inaugural season.|$|E

5|$|Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy {{rainfall}} to {{portions of the}} east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people <b>went</b> <b>without</b> power. In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed {{on many of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{picked up}} four points from their opening 12 league {{games of the}} 1994–95 season, and Southall {{received}} death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park. Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle, who led the club to a 2–0 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge – this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall. It was also the second match of seven consecutive games Everton <b>went</b> <b>without</b> conceding a goal – another club record. Southall then conceded just one goal (a penalty) in five games {{en route to the}} 1995 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Everton won the game 1–0, with Southall making a double save from Paul Scholes; the victory left Southall as the most decorated Everton player in the club's history.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{scored a}} 90th-minute winner for York away to Fleetwood in a 2–1 win, {{a result that}} ended Fleetwood's five-match unbeaten run. York then drew 0–0 at home to fellow midtable team Cheltenham, before beating Plymouth 4–0 away with goals from Fletcher, McCombe (2) and Carson as the team {{achieved}} successive away wins {{for the first time}} in 2013–14. York <b>went</b> <b>without</b> scoring for a fourth consecutive home match after drawing 0–0 with Southend. Having worn the armband since an injury to McGurk, Penn was appointed captain for the rest of the season, a position that had earlier been held by Smith and Parslow.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death <b>went</b> <b>without</b> notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
5|$|McBreen scored {{twice in}} 12 {{appearances}} for the Mariners in 2013–14 before signing for Shanghai East Asia permanently on a one-season contract {{for a fee}} of $250,000 on 31 January 2014. His second debut came when starting their 1–1 away draw with Liaoning Whowin on 9 March 2014, before scoring his first goal of the 2014 Chinese Super League with a left-footed volley from outside the penalty area in a 1–1 draw at home to Shanghai Greenland Shenhua on 26 April. He <b>went</b> <b>without</b> scoring in the final {{three months of the}} season, which he finished with five goals from 28 appearances as Shanghai ranked in fifth place in the 2014 Chinese Super League table. McBreen stated his desire to stay for another season, but admitted he might not be retained after the club was taken over by new owners.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often <b>went</b> <b>without</b> metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E

5|$|The Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team has represented the United States Naval Academy in intercollegiate college football since 1879. The team participated {{as an independent}} school {{for the majority of}} its existence, but joined the American Athletic Conference (formerly the Big East Conference) as an expansion team in 2015. The Midshipmen joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A when it was created in 1978, becoming one of the first independent schools in that division. The program has had 37 head coaches, one interim coach, and two separate periods where it <b>went</b> <b>without</b> a coach since its formation. Since December 2007, Ken Niumatalolo has served as head coach of the Midshipmen.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children <b>went</b> <b>without</b> clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{continued}} to enjoy some form with the bat with 33* against Nottinghamshire in {{the interval between}} the fifth and final Tests, though he went wicketless. On 27 August, Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval. The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border, while Willis took four wickets and Botham six. A century from Boycott then defied Lillee's seven wicket haul to take England to 314, and in reply Hendrick and Botham took four wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis <b>went</b> <b>without</b> a wicket in the second innings. With half-centuries from Gatting and Brearley, England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw. England were victorious in the series 3:1, and Botham's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as 'Botham's Ashes'.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team <b>went</b> <b>without</b> wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E
5|$|York City <b>went</b> <b>without</b> an {{official}} manager from their formation in May 1922 until {{the appointment of}} Jock Collier in July 1928. Collier initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's last season in the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. Collier oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. George Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager {{for the next three}} years, before Collier was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936–37 FA Cup. In March 1937, Collier retired from football to go into business with his brother. Former player Tom Mitchell was appointed, and in his first full season led York to the quarter-final of the 1937–38 FA Cup.|$|E

However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does not really love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that {{she is going to be}} working at a summer camp in Shimla. Rahul tells his daughter that she is not allowed to attend the summer camp and heads to a conference, only to find out that his mom and daughter <b>went</b> <b>without</b> telling him, having left a letter for him. They travel to the camp, with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well, and the two Anjalis meet each other. One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met Rahul's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes a fever, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion.
