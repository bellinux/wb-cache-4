5|$|Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican {{congressman from}} Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be {{universal}}. In 1866, Stanton, Anthony, {{and several other}} suffragists drafted a universal suffrage petition demanding {{that the right to}} vote be given <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of sex or race. The petition was introduced in the United States Congress by Stevens. Despite these efforts, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, without adjustment, in 1868.|$|E
5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{began the}} 2001–02 season controversially, after being {{dropped by the}} then manager Gérard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match {{following}} a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson. He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3–2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4–1, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler {{had been on a}} contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman – who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids <b>without</b> <b>consideration.</b> This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E

25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition {{conflict}} is a cognitive function that arises in people and {{allows them to}} {{make decisions based on}} immediate stimuli and stimuli that require a higher level of processing. In sober individuals, situations that produce an inhibition conflict would consist of one set of salient cues (external stimuli) that stimulate a certain response and other cues (internal stimuli such as possible negative consequences or societal standards and norms) that would inhibit the salient cues and therefore prevent rash action. Those influenced by alcohol myopia are unable to comprehend this second set of cues, as the condition narrows an individual’s ability for higher-level cognitive functioning. Therefore, these individuals tend to act rashly <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> for the consequences of their actions.|$|E

25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Construction in Agadir progressed rapidly between 1945 and 1955, with {{specific}} conditions {{that may have}} contributed to the high degree of destruction. Challenging designs were often undertaken with untrained workers, and a lack of good supervision was typical, along with an accelerated effort to finish the job. As there had been no serious earthquakes prior to 1960, construction in the city had been done <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of seismic activity. Masonry buildings of more than one story did not fare well, but reinforced concrete structures varied dramatically in their response. For example, some of the highest of this type collapsed completely, while a good number of them resisted the shock well, and some others escaped damage altogether. In most cases of complete collapse, the design of the buildings lacked with respect to building regulations, as these were not a primary concern of the architects and inadequate enforcement of the ordinances was also a factor.|$|E
25|$|Abrahams spent around 10 {{weeks in}} 1946 in Nyasaland taking {{evidence}} from colonial officials, estate owners and settlers, African politicians and chiefs and missionaries, visiting almost {{all parts of}} the protectorate. He submitted his report in October 1946 and it was published in early 1947. Abrahams identified the main problem as the conflicting African and European concepts of land ownership. In addition, many European landowners either acted illegally towards tenants or exercised their rights harshly and <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of customary practices. In part, this was because the system set up following the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance neither provided the owners with a reliable pool of labour nor enabled them to reduce the numbers living on their estates. Many African tenants, in Abrahams’ view, failed to understand their obligations or the limits on their legal rights. Many Africans living on Native Trust Land felt strong resentment at the large areas of under-used estate land.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantines and Fatimids {{entered into}} peace {{negotiations}} in 1032 and Hassan {{was present in}} the discussions in Constantinople. The Byzantines stipulated the restoration of Jarrahid governorship in Palestine under Fatimid suzerainty {{as a condition for}} peace, but az-Zahir refused. The Fatimids' rejection of this condition contributed to the collapse of the peace talks. The following year, the Jarrahids offered their loyalty to al-Dizbari in exchange for their former iqtaʿat in Palestine, but the attempt failed. The Fatimids and Byzantines ultimately concluded a ten-year peace treaty, <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of the Jarrahids' interests, in 1035. Afterward, Hassan and his son Allaf are mentioned on occasion, such as their assistance in the Byzantine defense of Edessa from the Marwanids and Numayrids in 1035/36. In 1038, the Jarrahids participated in al-Dizbari's conquest of Mirdasid-held Aleppo. As a result, Hassan was forced into confinement in Constantinople until 1040 as a means to prevent his tribe, with its unstable allegiances, from potentially attacking Antioch. The last mention of Hassan is in 1041, by which point the Jarrahids had been permitted by the Fatimids to re-enter Palestine. Hassan's rule at the time was opposed by the Fatimid governor of Damascus.|$|E
25|$|In 1832, the Reform Act {{extended}} {{the vote in}} Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from Tolpuddle in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages {{had been reduced to}} seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Chartist movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament <b>without</b> <b>consideration.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{she started}} working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these collages after she was {{cleaning}} out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After she saved a few of them, she {{decided to use the}} rest in a new series of collages. In these collages, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint. The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas. Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged <b>without</b> <b>consideration</b> of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures is highly exaggerated. All of the collages' titles from this series are different verb tenses which is interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and Michael Fried's insistence on the presentness of modern art. These works are also considered as a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older. This collage series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the Pace Gallery.|$|E
