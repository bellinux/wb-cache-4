The aim is to provide an intellectual and theoretical framework under which webfilmmakers can help create what the authors consider the new ‘art form’ of <b>webfilm.</b> Despite this aim, we have seen that much of the manifesto consists of a usability guide to Internet-friendly webfilmmaking, foregrounding its technological aspects. As such, it functions as prescription material and illustrates the power of non-human agents including bandwidth, hardware and software." ...|$|E

While most new media forms, in particular, hypertext, have received scholarly attention, research into moving image on the Internet had been limited. The thesis therefore set out to investigate webfilms, a form of short film on the WWW and the Internet, {{over a period of}} 9 years (1997 - 2005). The thesis was theoretically embedded in questions regarding new media as new field of research, since the increasing visibility of new media had resulted in the emergence of the discipline of ‘new media studies’. This context raised issues regarding the configuration of new media studies within the existing academic disciplines of media and cultural studies, which were explored in depth in the literature review. The case studies of the thesis explored and analysed webfilms from a vantage point of actor-network theory, since this was arguably the most appropriate methodology to a research object considerably influenced by technological factors. The focus was on the conditions of <b>webfilm</b> production, distribution, and exhibition, and the evolution of <b>webfilm</b> discourse and culture. The aim was to seek answers to the question ‘How didwebfilm arise as (new) form of film?’ In the process of research, a number of issues were raised including the changing definition and changing forms of webfilms, the convergence of media, and the complex interdependency of humans and their computers. The research re-evaluates the relationship between human and non-human factors in media production and presents a fresh approach by focusing on the network as unit of analysis. The thesis as a whole not only provides new information on the evolution of <b>webfilm</b> as a form of film, but also illustrates how the network interaction of humans and nonhumans {{lies at the heart of}} contemporary new media and convergence culture...|$|E

It focuses on the target audience’s experience of the website “Teknologiportalen”, which is an important channel of communication for the Danish Research and Technology Organization GTS- Advanced Technology Group. Furthermore, this thesis presents the reader {{with a list of}} improvement suggestion, to help Teknologiportalen improve its communication with its target audience. A quantitative online survey and seven qualitative interviews are conducted to produce the necessary empirical groundwork for an analysis. This thesis draws on Alfred Schutz’s theory on the structure of the life- world and on Web 2. 0 theory. Regarding methodology, this thesis uses Steinar Kvale and Bente Halkiers work on interview methodology. This master’s thesis concludes that there is an indication, which shows that certain areas could be met, to give the target audience a better experience of Teknologiportalen. These areas include: streamlining the website’s search engine, evolving the minimalistic design, using more pictures, producing short <b>webfilms</b> and podcasts, opening the site for user comments, incorporating a sharing tool and more...|$|R
