5|$|In 1989, {{seven years}} after his arrest in 1982, Andrew Wilson filed a civil suit against four detectives (including Burge), a former police superintendent, and the City of Chicago. He {{said that he had}} been beaten, suffocated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag, burned (by {{cigarette}} and radiator), and treated with electric shock by police officers when interrogated about the February 1982 murders; he also had been the victim of the pattern of a police and city cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), {{a teenage}} shop assistant, is {{being chased by}} mannequins in the {{basement}} of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive (Mark Benton), who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose the Doctor is dangerous, and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> doppelgänger.|$|E

5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
