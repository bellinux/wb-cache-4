40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} a panel geometry obtained by a novel manufacturing process for the development of ultra-compact flue gas-water condensing heat exchangers. In this process two stainless steel sheets are prepared and stacked and then brazed together in a special pattern outlining a desired configuration of water ducts and connecting manifolds. By injecting pressurized fluid to the clearance between the bonded sheets, the sheets are deformed and the enlarged clearance becomes a flow pass of water. By stacking several such bonded panels together, the clearances between them work as flue-gas passages. The principle of using this process is that panels can be produced more economically and with sufficient control over the parameters of the obtained geometry as well as the strength. Because of this manufacturing process, the cross-section of the <b>water</b> <b>duct</b> obtains a special noncircular shape, so the heat transfer characteristics must be specifically assessed for the new geometry, in order to qualify the new design. Through CFD analysis, we evaluate the heat transfer performance of the <b>water</b> <b>duct</b> in the novel heat exchanger by comparing with the heat transfer performance of a standard circular duct which has the same hydrodynamic diameter as the investigated <b>water</b> <b>duct.</b> Design EngineeringIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|E

The main application problems of radiant panel in summer include lower cooling capacity owing to high temperature of {{water supply and}} condensation. A new radiant panel was developed. <b>Water</b> <b>duct</b> and panel are straight forming which eliminates the thermal contact resistance. The panel are installed in an angle in order to discharge condensate water. The guiding gutter {{in the face of}} panel and condensate pipe are to collect and outlet condensate water. The summer test was done. The results show that the new radiant panel has higher cooling efficiency compare with conventional panel. The cooling efficiency is above 1000 w/m 2, and condensate water can be discharged quickly. Although new Ceiling Radiant Cooling Panel is still not perfect, but it is provides us with more choice...|$|E
50|$|This {{is similar}} to a U-tube tank but the <b>water</b> {{crossover}} <b>duct</b> is much larger and the air crossover contains a servo-controlled valve system. Since this valve controls the flow of air very little power is required. When the valve is closed, passage of air from one tank to the other is prevented and the resulting compression of air in the tank prevents flow of water also. When the valve opens, free movement of water and air is possible.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} sources must be balanced with environmental aspects. Especially {{it relates to}} the use of river water flow. Environmental requirements are hard to achieve on large hydropower. Much hydro are built and yet can be built on small rivers, usually building the dams which create small lakes and prevent movement of fauna along the river. In places of large inclination of river channel the dam can be substituted by <b>water</b> <b>ducts,</b> such as pipes. The movement of water in the pipe meets resistance and some part of water pressure is lost. There is little resistance to movement of water by laminar flow of water but this flow exist by small velocities of water. So it can be counted on turbulent flow. By a given diameter of pipe the maximum power can be get when 1 / 3 of the water pressure is used on water movement in the pipe. The cost of pipe is proportional to pipe length multiplied by the root of fifth degree of the pipe length. Artificial rapids can be made which reduce pipe length.

She moved a minimum distance of 454. 65 km from the time of her release up to 25 th March, 2012, using a total area of 726 kmÂ² (95 % MCP), but between 30 th December, 2011 and 25 th March, 2012, after moving into the human-dominated forest-agricultural landscape her home range was 431 kmÂ² (95 % MCP). Her home range also encompassed villages, roads and croplands. Her activity was largely nocturnal and she rested in dense foliage inside forest patches during the day. About half of all the prey items that we identified during this period (n = 12) were wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Although, she was present very close to areas where humans were active in the day, no untoward incident occurred. She was photographed in April 2013, a year after the collar stopped functioning, in the same region about 40 km from the release site, indicating that she is still present in the human-dominated area.
