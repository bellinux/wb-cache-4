5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

25|$|Uchimura {{competed in}} the London 2012 Olympics and had a rocky {{performance}} in the qualifications with several falls, eventually putting him in ninth place among the group of qualifiers for the all-around. In the men's team gymnastics final, Uchimura fell from the pommel horse during his dismount. The Japanese coaches appealed the scoring on this performance as he still landed on his feet and felt it should have counted as a full dismount, albeit with a large penalty. Before the appeal, Britain <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> silver and Ukraine bronze, but the appeal pushed Japan's points total up to get the silver and pushing Britain down to bronze. In the men's all around final, Uchimura dominated the competition and {{won the gold medal}} with a score of 92.690. He also won the silver medal in the men's floor exercise event final with a score of 15.8, thanks to the tie-breaking procedure working in his favour was automatically activated because of a tied second highest score of the final with Russia's Denis Ablyazin who competed a routine with the highest difficulty score, an enormous 7.1, of all the finalists.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš knew what he was doing. A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ocias, {{the main}} themes of Loved were of {{dominance}} and power, but {{to provide a}} fuller answer would [...] "defy {{the point of the}} game". His intentions in making the game <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people to think about the games they were playing—a direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use [...] "the resource of emotions" [...] invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and , along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montréal, as showing [...] "greater depth" [...] to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes [...] "force-feeding" [...] players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, when office {{administrator}} Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{gets a new}} computer for the receptionist's desk to replace the older model, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) wants a new computer, too. Pam points out that if she <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a new computer for one sales rep, {{she would have to}} get one for every sales rep. Unwilling to let it go, Andy convinces Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) into trading computers with him. Pam is angry when she finds out, and forces him to switch the computers back. In addition to continue pushing for a new computer, Andy confronts Pam about humiliating him in front of the office. In order to make it up to him, she tells him that the only way he can get a new computer is if his breaks. To accomplish this, he accepts all cookies, intentionally opens pop-up ads, and places food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, but they scratch it up to make it not look brand new. When they pretend to argue about {{it in front of the}} office, Pam claims that she found it in the warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that is in the warehouse and where it is stored, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days. Pam gleefully tells the interviewers that she is now [...] "full-on corrupt".|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
