And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after her}} return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in {{the world premiere of}} Britten's Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Britten had written this work {{specifically}} for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented [...] "a peak to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been groping for the last three years". A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: [...] "Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best".|$|E
500|$|The Triple Entente {{between the}} United Kingdom, France, and Russia had been signed in 1907. Germany had become {{significantly}} isolated—on the Continent, Germany was {{hemmed in by}} France {{in the west and}} Russia in the east, and the UK, with her powerful navy, was capable of blocking German access to the world shipping lanes. Admiral von Tirpitz reacted to this development with the request for newer and stronger capital ships. His thoughts on the matter were, [...] "The aim <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to keep in view ... for technical and organizing reasons as well as reasons of political finance was to build as steadily as possible." [...] His appeal {{came in the form of}} the proposed Second Amendment to the Naval Law, which was passed on 27 March 1908.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{has stated}} that he became serious about {{creating}} and engineering his own electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he {{has stated that}} he felt comfortable with how R and Hip hop music integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, Letur-Lefr. PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone was recorded while Frusciante looked {{to find new ways}} to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, [...] "My Recent History," [...] he notes that [...] "Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no idea how to execute." ...|$|E
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Geneva reconsidered its {{expulsion}} of Calvin. Church attendance had dwindled {{and the political}} climate had changed; as Bern and Geneva quarrelled over land, their alliance frayed. When Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto {{wrote a letter to}} the city council inviting Geneva to return to the Catholic faith, the council searched for an ecclesiastical authority to respond to him. At first Pierre Viret was consulted, but when he refused, the council asked Calvin. He agreed and his Responsio ad Sadoletum (Letter to Sadoleto) strongly defended Geneva's position concerning reforms in the church. On 21 September 1540 the council commissioned one of its members, Ami Perrin, to find a way to recall Calvin. An embassy reached Calvin while he was at a colloquy, a conference to settle religious disputes, in Worms. His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, [...] "Rather would I submit to death a hundred times than to that cross on <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to perish daily a thousand times over." ...|$|E
