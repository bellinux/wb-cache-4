Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a {{four out of}} five star rating and called it [...] "very good contemporary pop" [...] and a [...] "complete U-turn" [...] from [...] "It's My Time". Philip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus praised the song's chorus, in addition to Ewen's vocal performance. He also wrote that the end result is [...] "a monster hit <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and a single that is better than it has any right to be". Oikotimes.com commended the song as [...] "instantly catchy and memorable". Vicki Lutas of BBC described [...] "My Man" [...] as [...] "sexy, strong and ferocious". She applauded the chorus, but admitted that the song [...] "sounds a bit generic" [...] and [...] "lacks Jade's sparkle".|$|E
500|$|Initially, Jefferson and Hamilton {{enjoyed a}} {{friendly}} working relationship. While never close, they seldom clashed {{during the first}} year in the Washington administration. Even so, deep philosophical differences soon caused a rift between them, and finally drove them apart. Hamilton believed that a vigorous use of the central government was essential for the task of nation building. He also believed that [...] "a flourishing merchant economy would sow opportunities for all, resulting in a more philanthropic, knowledgeable and enterprising people." [...] In Jefferson's view, centralized government was [...] "simply European-style tyranny <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again." [...] He idealized the yeoman farmers, for they [...] "controlled their own destinies, and also a republic that, resting on the yeoman farmer, would keep 'alive that sacred fire' of personal liberty and virtue." [...] These differences gained their clearest expression in the debate about the Bank of the United States.|$|E
500|$|For Filipinos, {{music and}} dancing {{is said to}} be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed. [...] The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.|$|E

500|$|Peter Carew's {{claim of}} insubordination {{has been given}} support by James Watt, former Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, based on records of an {{epidemic}} of dysentery in Portsmouth which could have rendered the crew incapable of handling the ship properly, while historian Richard Barker {{has suggested that the}} crew actually knew that the ship was an accident <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> at which they balked and refused to follow orders. Marsden has noted that the Carew biography is in some details inconsistent with the sequence of events reported by both French and English eyewitnesses. It also reports that there were 700 men on board, an unusually high number. The distance in time to the event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch. The report of French galleys sinking the Mary Rose as stated by Martin du Bellay has been described as [...] "the account of a courtesan" [...] by naval historian Maurice de Brossard. Du Bellay and his two brothers were close to king FrancisI and du Bellay had much to gain from portraying the sinking as a French victory. English sources, even if biased, would have nothing to gain from portraying the sinking as the result of crew incompetence rather than conceding to a victory to the much-feared gun galleys.|$|E

2500|$|It was the Hatfield {{crash on}} 17 October 2000 {{that proved to}} be the {{defining}} moment in Railtrack's collapse. [...] The subsequent major repairs undertaken across the whole British rail network are estimated to have cost in the order of £580 million. According to Christian Wolmar, author of On the Wrong Line, the Railtrack board panicked in the wake of Hatfield. Because most of the engineering skill of British Rail had been sold off into the maintenance and renewal companies, Railtrack had no idea how many Hatfields were <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> nor did they have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions they were ordering – restrictions that brought the railway network to all but a standstill.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic noted her {{contribution}} {{to the success of}} black artists on the pop scene, commenting, [...] "Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity" [...] and that [...] "the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson's wake". The New York Times stated that [...] "Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions". Richard Corliss of Time magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:Of her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [...] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [...] She was a phenomenon <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1942, Halder told Hitler that he was underestimating the number of Soviet {{military}} units. Hitler argued that the Red Army was nearly broken. However, Halder had recently read a book about Stalin's defeat of Anton Denikin between the Don bend and what was then Tsaritsyn during the Russian Civil War. That battle resulted in Tsaritsyn being renamed Stalingrad. Halder was convinced the German Sixth Army {{was in the same}} position that Denikin was back then. Furthermore, Hitler did not like Halder's objections to sending General von Manstein’s 11th Army (then finishing the siege of Sevastopol, {{at the other end of}} the front) to assist in the attack against Leningrad. Halder also thought that an attack into the Caucasus was ill-advised. Finally, because of Halder’s disagreement with Hitler’s conduct of the war, Hitler concluded that the general no longer possessed an aggressive war mentality. The final straw came after Halder learned of an intelligence report showing Stalin could muster as many as 1.5 million men north of Stalingrad and west of the Volga. He told Hitler that the situation along the Don was a disaster <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> if Stalin turned that force loose on Stalingrad. In response, Hitler gave a speech announcing that he intended to find a replacement for Halder. Halder walked out stating [...] "I am leaving", and was retired into the [...] "Führer Reserve" [...] on 24 September 1942.|$|E
