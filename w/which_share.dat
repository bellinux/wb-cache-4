5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with lead and tin, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} portable art {{from what is}} now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the Neolithic period, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from Links of Noltland, including the Westray Wife, which is the earliest known depiction of a human face from Scotland.|$|E

5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites <b>which</b> <b>share</b> some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Beeston {{was built}} by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power. The siting of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take {{advantage}} of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of <b>which</b> <b>share</b> similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers.|$|E
5|$|By 2010, Marysville {{had grown}} to a {{population}} of 60,020 and surpassed Lynnwood and Edmonds to become the second-largest city in Snohomish County.

5|$|Haiti and the Dominican Republic, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> {{the island}} of Hispaniola, were spared much of the hurricane's force, as it passed 170mi (270km) to their south. However, 15people were killed among the island's two nations. Heavy rain flooded the streets of Santo Domingo and rough surf pounded the coast. Rain also caused {{landslides}} in Haiti, destroying several hundred homes and forcing 5,154people into temporary shelters, and compromising the temperamental water system {{in the town of}} Bainet.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High shares its {{heritage}} {{with several}} other institutions in Singapore with the same founder. The name of the institution is a direct phonic translation of the term “南侨” in Chinese which meant the Overseas Chinese of the Southeast Asian region (南洋华侨), particularly the Malayan Peninsula. The name of the institution {{is a reflection of}} its mission to empower youths through education, shared along {{with several other}} institutions <b>which</b> <b>share</b> the same identity, such as The Chinese High School (presently Hwa Chong Institution) as well as Nanyang Girls' High School.|$|E
5|$|The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) {{are also}} by Bruegel <b>which</b> <b>share</b> the same wedding theme and {{elements}} and were {{painted in the}} same period in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E

They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E

The intended purpose of the builders of Bara Gumbad is unclear: {{it may have been}} intended as a free-standing tomb, but no tombstone has been identified. The area in which Bara Gumbad is situated was formally called Khairpur village.|$|E
5|$|Unofficial {{versions}} of the game, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> {{some of the same}} playing features, but also incorporate changes so as not to infringe on copyrights, have been created by firms such as Late for the Sky Production Company and Help on Board.

Others have non-geographical themes such as Wine-opoly and Chocolate-opoly. There is also a version called Make Your Own -OPOLY, which allows you to customize all the game equipment and rules to your liking.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Norte Chico has also shifted {{the focus of}} research away from the highland areas of the Andes and lowlands adjacent to the mountains (where the Chavín, and later Inca, had their major centers) to the Peruvian littoral, or coastal regions. Norte Chico {{is located in a}} north-central area of the coast, approximately 150 to 200 km north of Lima, roughly bounded by the Lurín Valley on the south and the Casma Valley on the north. It comprises four coastal valleys: the Huaura, Supe, Pativilca, and Fortaleza; known sites are concentrated in the latter three, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> a common coastal plain. The three principal valleys cover only 1,800km², and research has emphasized the density of the population centers.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray {{is closely}} related to H. undulata and H. leoparda, <b>which</b> <b>share</b> much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and color pattern, resulting in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E
5|$|There are 22 {{stations}} in the Copenhagen Metro, a driverless rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. Nine of these metro stations are underground, twelve are elevated, and one is street-level. Christianshavn Station offers transfer between the system's two metro lines (M1 and M2), <b>which</b> <b>share</b> track between Vanløse and Christianshavn stations. From Christianshavn, M1 branches south traveling to Vestamager Station, while M2 heads southeast to Lufthavnen Station, which serves Copenhagen Airport. Flintholm, Nørreport and Vanløse stations offer transfer to the S-train, the city's other rapid transit system which the Copenhagen Metro was built to supplement. Transfer from the Copenhagen Metro to regional trains is possible at Lufthavnen, Nørreport and Ørestad stations. The City Circle Line, which is under construction and {{scheduled to open in}} 2019, is planned to have 17 stations, with transfer between the current and new lines at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv stations. The new lines will have a stop at Copenhagen Central Station (København H), the largest train station in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of <b>which</b> <b>share</b> the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Strawberry Panic! {{revolves}} around {{the lives of the}} adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools <b>which</b> <b>share</b> a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story {{revolves around}}, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.|$|E
