5|$|The route was {{primarily}} flat, {{although it did}} contain a few major ascents. The third stage contained ascents to Macerone, Rionero Sannitico, and Roccaraso. The Giro's sixth stage contained only one pass, the Passo Bracco. The seventh stage <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> contain any major ascents: the climbs of the Colle di Nava and the ascent to San Bartolomeo.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success.

By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E

5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to digital ink and paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. As men scrambled {{down the side of}} the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

5|$|Honorius (died 30 September 653) was {{a member}} of the Gregorian mission to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism in 597AD who later became Archbishop of Canterbury.

The mono version of The Beatles was made available worldwide on 9 September 2009, as part of The Beatles in Mono CD boxed set.

5|$|Jackson {{collaborated with}} filmmakers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 3D film Captain EO, which debuted in September 1986 {{at both the}} {{original}} Disneyland and at Epcot in Florida, and in March 1987 at Tokyo Disneyland. The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at Euro Disneyland after that park opened in 1992. All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> close, in 1998. The attraction would later return to Disneyland in 2010 after Jackson's death. In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses, in response to their disapproval of the Thriller video.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{garrison}} in Montevideo, {{the capital}} of Cisplatina (then Brazil's southernmost province), <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> surrender. In 1825, secessionists in the province rebelled. The United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina) attempted to annex Cisplatina. Brazil declared war, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor's Battalion, to which Luís Alves was attached, was sent to guard Montevideo, then besieged by rebel forces. Luís Alves fought in engagements against the insurgents during 1827 (7 February, 5 July, 7 July, 14 July, 5 August and 7 August).|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in the 2008 TNA Xscape match by Jay Lethal against {{five other}} competitors. TNA held {{qualification}} matches on Impact! {{leading up to}} Lockdown to determine the five other participants besides Lethal. The first to qualify was Curry Man by defeating Petey Williams on the March 13 episode. Sonjay Dutt defeated Homicide on the March 20 episode to qualify.

Consequences Creed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> qualify by defeating Jimmy Rave on the April 10 episode.|$|E
5|$|The entire Homicide cast {{returned}} {{for the second}} season. The uncertainty over Homicides future was stressful for the cast and crew, and the logistics of scheduling the filming around the actors' schedules was difficult. Daniel Baldwin publicly criticized NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield over the matter, and it was initially reported Ned Beatty would not return at all. The second season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> include original cast member Jon Polito, who was reportedly dismissed because NBC officials were unhappy with his physical appearance. Polito was publicly critical of the show after his dismissal.|$|E

5|$|The quark {{model was}} {{independently}} proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced {{as parts of}} an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The top quark <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> be discovered at Fermilab in 1995.|$|E

5|$|A star in Stan Kenton's famous {{orchestra}} in the 1940s and 1950s, {{as well as}} that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and {{winner of}} numerous awards, Manne slipped from public view as jazz became less central in popular music. In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he helped keep jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard. There, the house band was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others. Stan Getz <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> be featured (at a briefly occupied second location at Tetou's restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard), when, late in 1973, Manne was forced to close the club for financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|Additional AFC squadrons began {{forming in}} Australia for {{service on the}} Western Front, with No. 2, 3 and 4 Squadrons {{arriving}} in France between August and December 1917. No. 2 Squadron, equipped with DH5s, was subsequently involved in the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November 1917, conducting patrol duties, ground strafing and bombing enemy troops and positions. Casualties were high with 7 of the squadrons 18 aircraft shot down, and 2 pilots lost. No. 3 Squadron, equipped with RE8s, was supporting {{the final phase of}} the Battle of Passchendaele in Flanders, conducting mainly artillery spotting duties. No. 4 Squadron, equipped with Sopwith Camels, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> arrive in France, and was assigned to the First Army around Lens. Notably during March 1918 the squadron was engaged in aerial combat with aircraft commanded by Manfred von Richthofen—known as the 'Red Baron'—shooting down two German aircraft for the loss of one of their own. The Lens sector had been relatively quiet until 21 March 1918 when the Germans launched a major offensive, with No. 4 Squadron heavily engaged in low-level bombing to support the 4th Australian Division.|$|E
