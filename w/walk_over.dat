5|$|In 2015, the {{behaviour}} of an Epaulette shark {{was filmed}} in detail by the BBC {{for the first}} episode of a new documentary series named Shark, released around the 40th anniversary of Jaws. The documentary shows an Epaulette shark's ability to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> land, and its hunting behaviours in the ebbing tide.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} {{was very difficult to}} create. He explained that the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle does not have a flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new one had to be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E
5|$|The North Front defences, still {{following}} the course {{laid out by}} the Moors in the 11th century, are still substantially intact. A {{significant portion of the}} original Spanish and Moorish walls can still be seen, rising in a saw-tooth (en crémaillère) fashion from the Grand Battery. Although gaps have been cut in the walls to allow vehicle traffic to enter the city centre, pedestrians can still <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> the wooden drawbridge over the North Front ditch to pass through the Landport Gate into the city. The Moorish Tower of Homage continues to stand above the Grand Battery on the lower slopes of the Rock. It is now open to the public as part of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.|$|E

They {{competed in the}} preliminary rounds of the 2010 CAF FIFA U20 World Cup. In the preliminary round, {{they did not have}} to play as Guiena withdrew from the tournament. In the first round, they were supposed to play Nigeria but withdrew from the tournament. They were supposed to compete in the 2010 African Women U-20 Championship Qualifying competition meeting Togo in the first round, but Togo earned a <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> win against Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone eventually withdrew from the competition. The announcement was made a week after the under-17 lost 0–3 to Gambia.|$|E
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to <b>walk</b> <b>over.</b> Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

5|$|Norfolk Coast Path, {{an ancient}} long {{distance}} footpath, cuts {{across the south}} eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way. The tip of Blakeney Point {{can be reached by}} walking up the shingle spit from the car park at Cley Beach, or by boats from the quay at Morston. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4km (1.5mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a look-out for smugglers, it was used in succession as a coast guard station, by the Girl Guides, and as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, {{watching}} for insects {{and other small}} invertebrates in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.|$|E

25|$|After opening, {{operations}} {{settled down}} to a schedule of three mixed return services for daily runs between Lyttelton and Christchurch.

25|$|When {{a female}} comes to mate, she {{lands on the}} perch site. The male will then either lunge or walk slowly toward the female. The male mounts the female for {{approximately}} 8 seconds and extends its curled antennae and draws the female antennae upward in a behavior called lassoing. Following mating, females will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> {{the surface of the}} perch site, dragging their abdomens, before flying off.|$|E
25|$|The site {{first became}} popular with {{tourists}} {{during the nineteenth}} century, particularly after {{the opening of the}} Giant's Causeway Tramway, and only after the National Trust took over its care in the 1960s were some of the vestiges of commercialism removed.

25|$|Apparently {{many people}} have {{experienced}} spectacular allergic reactions when they have {{come into contact with}} both live and dead tick products. Having a tick simply <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> a person's hand produces in some people an intense discomfort and itching – what particular components of the tick body cause these reactions is unknown, but it could be a water-soluble component that is excreted through the cuticular canals.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{surprising}} hunting behaviour occurs among the araneophagous Salticidae, and it varies greatly in method. Many of the spider-hunting species quite commonly will attack other spiders, whether fellow salticids or not, {{in the same way}} as any other prey, but some kinds resort to web invasion; nonspecialists such as Phidippus audax sometimes attack prey ensnared in webs, basically in acts of kleptoparasitism — sometimes they leap onto and eat the web occupant itself, or simply <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> the web for that purpose.|$|E
