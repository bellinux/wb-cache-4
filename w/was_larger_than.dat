5|$|Beckett {{engaged in}} {{protracted}} {{negotiations with the}} Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 million signing bonus.

5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number is said to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the other number. If a number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> another number, and if the other number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> a third number, then the first number <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the third number. Example: five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> four, and four <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three, therefore five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three. But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three. But seven <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> six, therefore seven <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three... therefore eight <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three... therefore nine <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three, etc.|$|R

5|$|P. l. fossilis, P. fossilis or P. spelaea fossilis, {{known as}} the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been {{recovered}} from Germany and Italy.

5|$|The {{director}} assigned was Rudolph Cartier, {{with whom}} Kneale {{had a good}} working relationship; the two had collaborated on the previous Quatermass serials, {{as well as the}} literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). The budget of £17,500 allocated for Quatermass and the Pit <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> that of the previous Quatermass productions.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen horses {{entered the}} Derby, {{which could have}} at most twenty participants. Horse owners had to pay a final entry fee of $2,500 to have their horses officially entered. The field <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> {{anticipated}} because of new entries following Secretariat's loss at the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York.|$|E

5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E
5|$|Cairo protesters had {{gathered}} {{in the morning in}} front of the High Court in the centre of Cairo. The demonstration <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> expected. It broke through the security cordon and moved to Tahrir Square. Thousands protested in Cairo, with 15,000 occupying Tahrir Square (Liberation Square). Police used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who in turn threw stones at police, eventually forcing them to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Due to First World War losses, Cunard began a post-war {{rebuilding}} programme including eleven intermediate liners. It {{acquired the}} former Hapag Imperator (renamed the Berengaria) {{to replace the}} lost Lusitania as the running mate for Mauretania and Aquitania, and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three-ship express service. By 1926 Cunard's fleet <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> before the war, and White Star was in decline, having been sold by IMM.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 a large hoard of third-century Roman coins was {{unearthed}} {{in a field}} {{near the}} town. Frome {{was one of the}} largest towns in Somerset until the Industrial Revolution, and <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Bath from AD 950 until 1650. The town originally grew due to the wool and cloth industry. It later diversified into metal-working and printing, although these have declined. The town was enlarged during the 20th century but still retains {{a very large number of}} listed buildings, and most of the centre falls within a conservation area.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> at any other time in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status until 2006.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance.
