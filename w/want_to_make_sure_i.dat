Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me.

Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E

5000|$|After Fall Out Boy's hiatus in late 2009, Stump {{embarked}} on a solo side project. His first solo album, Soul Punk, was tentatively scheduled for release in February 2011, with Stump saying in November 2010, [...] "the album should be out in February 2011 and as can be inferred from the long delay, it's changed dramatically from the album I alluded to a year ago ...

I have a lot of ideas that could eat up immense amounts of time and I'm trying to weigh out - just think it through. I don't want to pull the trigger on something and go, 'Man, I should have done it in this way.' And I just haven't had a chance to be in a calm place where I can think it through completely and make that decision.|$|E

Seeing this connection and the change of atmosphere in his music; Lennox says: A lot of the songs on Person Pitch are kind of sugary. ... It's really mellow and sunny here Portugal and I feel like the album really sounds like that to me. Also the stuff that's {{happened to me in}} the past two years, like getting married and having a kid and all that, has had a pretty profound impact on the kind of music I play and the kind of subjects I address. My approach to being a musician has drastically changed from having a kid and being a provider. It was kind of terrifying at first, I won't lie to you. It's made me feel like I don't want to fuck up, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> cover all my bases.

In the first qualifying I was P1 but I had an accident with Felix Rosenqvist and because of that accident I had a seven-place grid penalty. Then this morning I had a crash in San Francisco, and because of that crash I wasn't pushing so hard in this corner. I was taking care every time. But I was P1 in qualifying and all the time I was battling with Marco Wittmann. He did a good job to improve on my best time and put me down to P2, but it has been all year like this, and it is nice to come here again to be P1 and P2." [...] Roberto Merhiprovisionally qualified second on the grid, but was demoted to eighth for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Merhi on top, again with a margin of over 1.5 seconds to the field. However, his session came to an early end in deteriorating track conditions as he misjudged his braking for Lisboa and ran into the back of Rosenqvist, ending the session for both drivers. Wittmann ended up second ahead of Nasr, Juncadella and Alexander Sims. Sekiguchi finished the session in sixth place ahead of top-placed rookie Hannes van Asseldonk and António Félix da Costa with William Buller and Rosenqvist rounding out the top ten. Following them were Foresti, Kimiya Sato with Richie Stanaway and Magnussen provisionally lining up on row seven. Daniel Abt, who held the lead of the Grand Prix before crashing out in 2010, was next ahead of Jazeman Jaafar, Marko Asmer, Laurens Vanthoor and Jimmy Eriksson. Adderly Fong ended the session in 20th, ahead of Carlos Muñoz, Huertas, Hideki Yamauchi, Carlos Sainz Jr., Hywel Lloyd, Evans, Valtteri Bottas, Pietro Fantin, Richard Bradley and Yasuda. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. For earlier free practice incidents, Magnussen and Rosenqvist were sent to the back of the field. Rosenqvist was also given a three-place grid penalty for illegally crossing the pit lane exit line, along with session pacesetter Merhi, Asmer and Signature team-mates Vanthoor, Muñoz and Sainz. Yasuda was given a six-place grid drop for crossing the line on two occasions. Merhi was then given another grid penalty for running into Rosenqvist, taking his total drop for the qualification race to ten places. Prior to second qualifying, Merhi, Rosenqvist and van Asseldonk - whose original penalty had not been announced - had their penalties rescinded.|$|E

30|$|Hilary {{also showed}} {{significant}} shifts toward more student-centered responses on several questions (Figs.  2 and 3). During the initial interview, Hilary described how she assessed student understanding, “There {{are always the}} assessments, and with assessments I do try {{to mix it up}} a little bit…” This suggests a focus on measures given by the instructor. She went on to say, “If they actually come to a…some kind of solution [correct] to this problem…” and here she was not only focusing on assessments but on the correct solutions to those assessments to gauge understanding. Together, these two responses align with a transitional pedagogical belief system. However, in the post-development interview Hilary’s response shifted to a more student-centered view, stating “when they {{can come up with a}} very…an original idea or thought” and “when they [students] are getting the information and maybe making comments on how this is useful or important to them…” The question about determining what to teach in class received the most traditional responses (Fig.  4). During her initial pre-development interview, Hilary responded in an instructor-centered way where she stated “time is always a constraint…I do have topics that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> cover over the course of the semester. Her response on the post-development interview shifted toward student-centered where she stated that she chooses topics “that they can internalize and see the importance of those things, whether you are a geologist, a teacher, or construction worker things that are going to affect their everyday life”. This response showed a student-centered focus on science literacy and she elaborated further when asked why she chooses topics in this way “It’s not because they are students, but because they are humans”. When asked during the pre-development interview how she assesses learning in the class, Hilary stated “I kind of have these bigger assessments at the end of three or four chapters”. Initially, she has an instructor-centered focus on summative assessments given after she covered topics in class. This view changed during the post-development interview where she responded in a more student-centered manner by stating that she assessed learning by “the discussions really, again they [students] give me a very good idea of what’s going on during a week to week basis”. She was focusing on interactions among students to determine if learning occurred and she was continually doing this as opposed to focusing on summative assessments given after the fact.|$|E
