40|$|The {{solar wind}} {{provides}} a unique natural "laboratory" in which plasma turbulence may be investigated in-situ. Turbulence is statistically reproducible. Thus, {{in this thesis}} we investigate plasma turbulence in the solar wind through the statistical study of magnetic field observations. In particular, we investigate single-satellite time-series of the magnetic field. We discuss hydrodynamic turbulence, and make parallels between hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In hydrodynamic turbulence a unique scaling relation may be determined from dimensional analysis. Importantly, one may not derive a unique scaling relation for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from dimensional analysis. Therefore, comparison of observations and turbulence models are key to determining the underlying physics for specific plasma parameters. The inertial range is a range of scales over which energy cascades from large to small temporal-spatial scales. This thesis <b>will</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>be</b> focused on the anisotropy and scaling of the inertial range within the solar wind. We investigate how sampling a solenoid field, i. e.. B = 0, with a single satellite produces an apparent nonaxisymmetry {{with respect to the}} background magnetic field. We also investigate how time-series discontinuities produced by non-turbulent structures alter the statistical analysis of various anisotropy measures. We will find that the commonly held picture of the solar wind, that specific temporal-spatial scales have a distinct physical origin, is an over simplified model. We will show that non-turbulent structures must be removed from the observations in order to analysis the statistics of the turbulence accurately. The work in this thesis helps to constrain theories of plasma turbulence where there is a background magnetic field with a greater magnitude than the root-mean-square magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} the presence of farmland birds during recent decades has provoked much attention in agri-environmental policy and ecological research. However, the still limited understanding of the socio-economical mechanisms that govern the decline in bird presence hampers the formulation of effective adjustments in land-use and farming practices that could support the return of birds to farmland, i. e. the required fine-tuning of management practices. As a consequence, the existing agri-environmental schemes that offer financial compensation to farmers for implementing generally simple and rather crude measures to stimulate the presence of birds have been limited in their effectiveness and subject to much debate. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a sociological appraisal of farmers¿ experiences with meadow bird protection in a mainly dairy farming area in the Netherlands. The methodology combined visual map analysis, surveys, interviews with farmers and experts, and monitoring farmers¿ discussions. The results allowed an assessment of (i) farmers¿ views on historical changes in bird numbers in the area and the current distribution of bird nests, (ii) locally adjusted, fine-tuned management practices that were considered to be promising for protecting bird nests, (iii) the importance of farm management with `an eye for birds¿, i. e. farmers and/or birdwatchers paying additional attention to the presence of nests and chicks before carrying out farming activities, and (iv) the views of key experts in the socio-institutional network in the case study area. The paper concludes that there are various promising options for fine-tuning farm management so it offers better bird protection, but it is expected that such measures <b>will</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>be</b> adopted on less intensively managed farms...|$|E

Based on statistical analysis, upper limits on the production cross section are observed to be between 0. 01 pb and 0. 006 pb for colour octet particles (gluinos) with masses ranging from 300 GeV/c^ 2 to 1400 GeV/c^ 2, and 0. 01 pb to 0. 004 pb for colour triplet particles (stops and sbottoms) with masses ranging from 200 GeV/c^ 2 to 900 GeV/c^ 2. In the context of Supersymmetry with decoupled sfermion and sboson sectors (Split-SUSY), this gives a lower limit on the gluino mass of 989 GeV/c^ 2, and 683 GeV/c^ 2 for the stop mass and 618 GeV/c^ 2 for the sbottom mass. In addition, a new method is presented that improves the speed (β) estimation for long-lived particles in the ATLAS tile calorimeter with a factor of 7 improvement in resolution at low-β and a factor of 2 at high-β.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether Buddhist {{beliefs and}} practices serve to reinforce and/or promote a Korean and/or Canadian cultural prism for next-generation Korean Buddhist practitioners in Toronto, Canada. I define Korean and Canadian cultural prisms based on the cross-cultural psychological framework of Individualism-Relational Collectivism (I-RC) and Analytical-Holistic (A-H) cognition. The aim of my research is to problematize culture {{in the construction of}} religious meaning and behaviour for relatively bicultural individuals. My research question can thus be summarized as follows: How is religious meaning and behaviour culturally constructed by next-generation Korean Buddhist practitioners in Canada? What role do individual cultural orientations and the different Buddhist cultural traditions play in this cultural construction and how does Buddhism compare to the other religions (namely Protestantism) practiced by younger-generation Korean-Canadians in this regard? By answering these questions, I ultimately hope to show whether the meaning system of Korean culture is preserved through religion among the younger generation of Korean Buddhist practitioners. I hypothesize that, due to the relatively non-authoritarian nature of Buddhism, the light of Buddhist {{beliefs and practices}} <b>will</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>be</b> refracted through the a priori cultural prism of the individual in question, and the role of Buddhist doctrine and institutions in promoting a particular orientation (individualistic/relationally collectivistic and analytic/holistic) will be minimal and subordinate to the individual. The particular cultural orientation of this prism will, in turn, be dependent upon individual levels of monoculturalism (Korean or Canadian) or biculturalism (Korean and Canadian). In this way, Buddhism may serve to both preserve and undermine the Korean cultural meaning system. By comparison, I hypothesize that the relatively authoritarian nature of (Protestant) Christianity will likely encourage younger-generation Korean Christians to relate to their religion in a predominantly uniform way, regardless of the individual’s cultural orientation...|$|E

It contains more than 30 000 records, covering a period of more than 100 years. This large amount of information, combined with the co-operation with ZOBODAT (Linz, Austria), made it possible to conduct some statistical and biogeographical analyses. The county of Salzburg covers 7153 km 2, less than 1 % of the area of central Europe. It was almost completely covered with ice during the last ice age period until 18 000 years ago. Despite this, 3750 beetle species have been found in the area. The main cause for this relatively high number of species is the high degree of heterogenity of the landscape in the county of Salzburg. Besides, the analysis of the distributional ranges of the beetles of Salzburg reveals that most of them occupy a very large range, which indicates a high dispersal capacity. This faunistic study of beetles was published in the German language, because it <b>will</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>be</b> used by colleagues from German speaking countries. Nevertheless, the book can also be used by entomologists without or with very little knowledge of the German language. The general chapters are richly illustrated and the distribution in Salzburg of 154 beetle-species is figured in grid maps. The recording sites are registered in an index, containing precise data on the locality including the coordinates according to a small scale grid.

40|$|Energy is {{increasingly}} becoming an exclusive commodity in next generation wireless communication systems, where even in legacy systems, the mobile operators operational expenditure is largely {{attributed to the}} energy bill. However, {{as the amount of}} mobile traffic is expected to double over the next decade as we enter the Next Generation communications era, the need to address energy efficient protocols will be a priority. Therefore, we will need to revisit the design of the mobile network in order to adopt a proactive stance towards reducing the energy consumption of the network. Future emerging communication paradigms will evolve towards Next Generation mobile networks, that will not only consider a new air interface for high broadband connectivity, but will also integrate legacy communications (LTE/LTE-A, IEEE 802. 11 x, among others) networks to provide a ubiquitous communication platform, and one that can host a multitude of rich services and applications. In this context, one can say that the radio access network <b>will</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>be</b> OFDMA based, providing the impetus for further research studies on how this technology can be further optimized towards energy efficiency. In fact, advanced approaches towards both energy and spectral efficient design will still dominate the research agenda. Taking a step towards this direction, LTE/LTE-A (Long Term Evolution-Advanced) have already investigated cooperative paradigms such as SON (self-Organizing Networks), Network Sharing, and CoMP (Coordinated Multipoint) transmission. Although these technologies have provided promising results, some are still in their infancy and lack an interdisciplinary design approach limiting their potential gain. In this thesis, we aim to advance these future emerging paradigms from a resource allocation perspective on two accounts. In the first scenario, we address the challenge of load balancing (LB) in OFDMA networks, that is employed to redistribute the traffic load in the network to effectively use spectral resources throughout the day. We aim to reengineer the load-balancing (LB) approach through interdisciplinary design to develop an integrated energy efficient solution based on SON and network sharing, what we refer to as SO-LB (Self-Organizing Load balancing). Obtained simulation results show that by employing SO-LB algorithm in a shared network, it is possible to achieve up to 15 - 20...|$|E

If the attractive forces are too strong, particle <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>predominantly</b> in one of the two length scales and no density of diffusion anomaly is observed. The structural anomalous region is present for all the cases...|$|R
