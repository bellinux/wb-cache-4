40|$|One of {{the most}} popular test methods for the {{evaluation}} of thermally sprayed coatings and substrate pre-treatment is the bond strength test in accordance to the standard EN 582 (in Europe) or ASTM C 633 - 79 (in the U. S.). An interlaboratory test, carried out in 2003, has shown that bond strength tests of samples that were joined by different institutions in accordance to DIN EN 582 lead to bond strength values that varied by the factor 2, even if the same adhesive was used. The test not only made clear that the adhesives used to join the loading block to the substrate block but also many other parameters have a tremendous influence on the results of the bond strength tests. It was also clarified that the DIN standard needs to be supplemented in order to improve the comparability and the reproducibility of the bond strength test results. The first aim of this work was to identify the influencing parameters by carrying out Failure Mode and Effect Analyses (FMEA) together with namable institutions. Based on these results, a <b>work</b> <b>instruction</b> based on the DIN standard will be composed in order to avoid its weak spots. Later, a second interlaboratory test will be carried out to evaluate the quality of the <b>work</b> <b>instruction...</b>|$|R

In order to prove that, I implemented a lesson plan in a secondary school in which the main goal is using specific vocabulary in real usage.

When designing the lesson plan, I had in my mind not only the acquisition of the specific vocabulary but the improvement of all the learning skills, but most of all, speaking. The main objectives of this paper are: on the one hand, to show the benefits of project <b>work</b> <b>instruction</b> in the acquisition of vocabulary and on the other hand, to assess the implementation of the lesson plan.
