5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

25|$|Figures such as agent Max Clifford {{have advised}} gay players {{to keep their}} {{sexuality}} a secret {{for the sake of}} their careers, saying that to be openly gay would potentially damage their playing prospects. This would also apply abroad, where even if accepted in England a gay player might face a new barrier if he wished to play in a country less accepting of homosexuality. Coming out <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> bring a gay player abuse from the terraces, and perhaps elsewhere too; this would affect some players more than others.|$|E
25|$|The River Shannon {{served as}} an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of Connacht and Meath. Both Brian's father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin {{and his older brother}} Mathgamain {{conducted}} river-borne raids, in which the young Brian <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have participated. This was probably the root of his appreciation for naval forces in his later career. Thus an important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the Hiberno-Norse city of Limerick on an isthmus around which the Shannon River winds (known today as King's Island or the Island Field). The Norse had made many a raid themselves from the Shannon, and the Dalcassians likely benefited from some interaction with them, from which they would have been exposed to innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.|$|E

25|$|After the fiasco of the Cherson expedition, the {{citizens}} there proclaimed a new man, Bardanes (an exiled General) the Basileus of Byzantium. Justinian was enraged at these turn of events. Once more he began redirecting resources to another expedition under the Patriarch Maurus against Cherson, resources {{that could have}} been better spent against the Arabs or the Bulgars. The Khazars appeared at the scene preventing the expedition from destroying no more than two defense towers before being obliged to make terms. The Patriarch realized that returning to the capital in defeat <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> lead to a violent retirement at the hands of Justinian. Therefore, in a similar case to Leontius and Tiberius' usurpation, he defected and, with the army and navy under his command, declared his support for the renegade Bardanes, who changed his name to Philippicus.|$|E
25|$|London has {{proposed}} Games based on providing world-class facilities {{and services for}} the athletes, and a legacy for sport and the community. Whilst the Olympic Park <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> leave a strong sporting and environmental legacy for London, {{the magnitude of the}} project, including the planned upgrade and expansion of transport infrastructure, would require careful planning to ensure all facilities and rehabilitation projects were completed on time. Air quality in London at proposed Games-time is generally satisfactory. Increasing levels of ozone pollution are however a concern, but legislation and actions now in place are aimed at correcting that trend. With its rich history, the capacities of UK Paralympic Sport are {{among the best in the}} world. Athletes have been closely involved in the planning of the Olympic Village. The east side of the village would appear to be somewhat crowded.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that because snowball Earth <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have {{decimated}} the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see founder effect), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces {{as a result of the}} differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.|$|E

25|$|Taksin took {{important}} {{steps to}} show that he was a worthy successor to the throne. He was said to take an appropriate treatment to the remnants of the ex-Royal Family, arranged a grand cremation of the remains of Ekatat, and tackled the problem of locating the capital. Possibly, Taksin realized that Ayutthaya city had suffered such vast destruction that to restore it to its former state <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have strained his resources. The Burmese were quite familiar with the various routes leading to Ayutthaya, and in the event of renewal of a Burmese attack on it, the troops under the liberator would be inadequate for the effective defence of the city. With these considerations in mind, he established his capital at Thonburi, nearer to the sea than Ayutthaya. Not only would Thon Buri be difficult to invade by land, it would also prevent an acquisition of weapons and military supplies by anyone ambitious enough to establish himself as an independent prince further up the Chao Phraya River. As Thonburi was a small town, Prince Tak's available forces, both soldiers and sailors, could man its fortifications, and if he found it impossible to hold it against an enemy's attack, he could embark the troops and beat a retreat to Chantaburi.|$|E

500|$|Tyler {{was sworn}} in on March 4, 1841, in the Senate chamber, and {{delivered}} a three-minute speech about states' rights before swearing in the new senators and attending President Harrison's inauguration. Following Harrison's two-hour speech on that freezing March 4, the Vice President returned to the Senate to receive the President's Cabinet nominations, presiding over the confirmations the following day—a total of two hours as President of the Senate. Expecting few responsibilities, he then left Washington, quietly returning {{to his home in}} Williamsburg. Seager later wrote, [...] "Had William Henry Harrison lived, John Tyler <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have been as obscure as any vice-president in American history." ...|$|E
500|$|Struthers {{published}} about 70 {{papers on}} anatomy. He {{set up a}} popular series of lectures for the public, held on Saturday evenings. Many of the methods he used remain relevant today. He had a powerful effect on medical education in Britain, in 1890 establishing the format of three years of [...] "pre-clinical" [...] academic teaching and examination in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. His system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. His 21st century successors at the anatomy school in Aberdeen write that [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> be greatly dismayed at the drastic reduction {{in the teaching of}} basic medical sciences, and the subsequent perceived decline in the anatomical knowledge of medical students and practicing clinicians," [...] and they quote one of Struthers' sayings to his students: ...|$|E
500|$|As sole emperor (361-3), Julian succumbed, as many Roman leaders {{before him}} (e.g. Crassus, Trajan, Septimius Severus) to [...] "Alexander the Great syndrome": {{the desire to}} emulate the Macedonian general and conquer the Persian empire. He invaded Mesopotamia {{at the head of}} an {{enormous}} army of 65,000. But the campaign was a disaster: Julian lost his own life and his army was forced to retreat with huge losses. [...] Although most of these would have been from the eastern comitatus and from the emperor's own escort army, the comitatus of Illyricum and Gaul <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have been stripped of troops to fill the gaps. The result was that in 366 Gaul was again overrun by Alamanni hordes and Julian's painstaking work of restoration undone. This forced Julian's successor, Valentinian I, to spend years carrying out a virtual replay of Julian's Gallic campaign.|$|E

No man could escape from his obligations, and Captain Parsons owed it to his fellow-countrymen of Little Primpton to let them show their appreciation of his great deed.|$|R

500|$|He kicked 28 {{goals in}} the 1912 SAFL season. During a game against Norwood at Norwood Oval, Oliver {{got into a fight}} with Ed Edwards of Norwood with both players {{reported}} by umpire Dollman. As a result both Oliver and Edwards were suspended thereby meaning the Magarey Medal favourite would be disqualified from winning the award. Despite this, {{at the end of the}} 1912 SAFL season he would be awarded his second consecutive Port Adelaide Best and Fairest. Oliver polled first in the clubs best and fairest for almost every round and won the award by over 500 votes. The Register, a local Adelaide newspaper, said regarding the Magarey Medal that [...] "While giving full credit to the winner, however, it is only fair to state that had not Oliver (the brilliant young Port Adelaide player) been disqualified through a regrettable occurrence in a match at Norwood he <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have been the medallist this time.

500|$|In {{the initial}} Persona 4 game, the main player-controlled {{character}} is {{known simply as}} the [...] "Protagonist" [...] or [...] "Hero", whose name is decided by the player. The name [...] "Yu Narukami" [...] was first given to the character in the 2011 anime adaptation, , and has since been used in official games where the character is unable to be named by the player, beginning with Persona 4 Arena. Prior to this, {{he was given the}} name of Sōji Seta in the game's manga adaptation. In an interview, game director Katsura Hashino drew attention {{to the way in which}} the Protagonist remains silent and emotionless throughout the game. This leaves the player to interpret the Protagonist's emotional reactions subjectively at any particular point. Hashino elaborated on this particular character trait becoming an obstacle for Persona 4: The Animations director Seiji Kishi, since the character <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have to speak and show some level of emotion. In the same interview, Kishi admitted the difficulty of transitioning the silent Protagonist into the anime without destroying what Hashino had already established.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{said that}} the arrest of criminals before {{they have a chance}} to commit their crimes in the movie had some {{real-world}} background in post-9/11 America, saying that [...] "e’re giving up some of our freedom so that the government can protect us." [...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it <b>would</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|E

Two alternatives presented themselves: either the British could, “abandon the attempt to keep up an effective control over Chitral or they could put a sufficient garrison there”. As far as Shuja was concerned, a sudden pull out by the British would create a power vacuum {{and set the stage}} for further belligerence in the state of which he had just assumed rulership.
