5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
25|$|Hobblebush and {{serviceberry}} {{are common}} shrubs {{at the higher}} elevations. Vascular plants {{to be found in}} the forest understorys include several fern varieties (predominantly woodfern and hay-scented), stinging nettle and jewelweed. trillium, <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel,</b> clintonia, bunchberry, starflower and foamflower round out the biome for the flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel,</b> bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii.

These wetlands are also the most interesting areas for mosses and lichens; Fulufjället is one of the richest sites in all Sweden, with 394 species of moss and over 500 species of lichens found.

The Lambroughton woods beyond (until recently the property of the Montgomery / Southannan Estate) are not shown on the older maps including the 1911 OS, they are shown in the 1960 OS map as a pine plantations amongst what was scrub or partial woodland cover containing elder, gean, ash, etc. Before this time the area above the river was not even fenced off at the top where it becomes 'level' with the field.|$|E
500|$|As {{elevation}} increases, {{the forest}} is subjected to colder temperatures, increased moisture, and acidic, infertile soils. As a result, conifers, or [...] "softwoods" [...] become the dominant species. Two trees, red spruce and balsam fir, are present throughout this zone, with paper birch, striped maple and mountain ash present in its lower levels. Like the hardwood forest below it, the spruce-fir forest also holds understory plants; commonly found are <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel,</b> Indian pipes, Canada mayflowers, and bluebead lilies.

50|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the front line on 10 May {{in the region of}} Hill 60 and began preparations for the attack. These preparation were observed by the Germans on the higher ground who assaulted the line on 13 May, which was repulsed, this attracted counter raiding by the 70th Brigade on 16 and 20 May. During this time the division's easily observed artillery attracted heavy German counter battery fire with serious casualties resulting. The division was to form the left flank of the advance on a front ~2000 yards wide, with its furthest advance ~1400 yards deep. After the artillery bombardment and the detonation of 19 mines on 7 June, the 69th and 70th brigades (the 69th reinforced with the 11th Northumberland Fusiliers and 12th Durham Light Infantry) advanced over the ridge and down each side of the valley on the southern flank of the Klein-Zillebeke spur, with fresh battalions leap-frogging the others when the second phase line had been reached. The new line was held until the 24th Division relieved them on 13 June.The division {{returned to the}} line between 26 and 28 June in the area of Battle <b>wood</b> and Mt <b>Sorrel</b> and began preparations for the next phase of the planned assault.

5000|$|Oxalis acetosella (<b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> or common <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel)</b> is a rhizomatous {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Oxalidaceae, common in most of Europe and parts of Asia.

50|$|The {{situation}} {{regarding the}} identity of the shamrock was further confused by a London botanist James Ebenezer Bicheno, who proclaimed in a dissertation in 1830 that the real shamrock was Oxalis acetosella or <b>Wood</b> <b>Sorrel.</b> Bichino falsely claimed that clover was not a native Irish plant and had only been introduced into Ireland {{in the middle of the}} 17th century, and based his argument on the same comments by Elizabethan authors that shamrock had been eaten. Bicheno argued that this fitted the <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> better than clover, as <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> was often eaten as a green and used to flavour food. Bicheno's argument has not been generally accepted however, as the weight of evidence favours a species of clover.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{mention of}} {{shamrock}} in the English language occurs in 1571 {{in the work}} of the English Elizabethan scholar Edmund Campion. In his work Boke of the Histories of Irelande, Campion describes the habits of the [...] "wild Irish" [...] and states that the Irish ate shamrock: [...] "Shamrotes, watercresses, rootes, and other herbes they feed upon". The statement that the Irish ate shamrock was widely repeated in later works and seems to be a confusion with the Irish word seamsóg or <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Oxalis). There is no evidence from any Irish source that the Irish ate clover, but there is evidence that the Irish ate <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel.</b> For example, in the medieval Irish work Buile Shuibhne (The Frenzy of Sweeney), the king Sweeney, who has gone mad and is living in the woods as a hermit, lists <b>wood</b> <b>sorrel</b> among the plants he feeds upon.|$|E
