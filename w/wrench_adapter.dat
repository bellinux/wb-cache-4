30|$|The {{head of an}} {{abutment}} screw is {{cut into}} a hexagon and pushed into and fixed to the hexagonal hole (for multi-unit abutments) of a machine driver. With this, a torque <b>wrench</b> <b>adapter</b> and torque wrench are assembled. A hand driver is rotated clockwise to the limit, and the torque value is read.|$|E
40|$|Adapter for {{torque wrench}} {{tightens}} nuts in confined spaces. Allows full rotation of nuts with minimum clearance of <b>wrench.</b> <b>Adapter,</b> spanner-type attachment that fits on end of standard torque wrench. Pair of dowel pins centers and locks wrench onto nut. Used to apply torque of 40 lb-in, also withstands torques up to 100 lb-ft...|$|E
40|$|Space {{technology}} utilization {{for developing}} tools, adapters, and fixtures {{and procedures for}} assembling, installing, and servicing electrical components and equipment are discussed. Some of the items considered are: (1) pivotal screwdriver, (2) termination locator tool for shielded cables, (3) solder application tools, (4) insulation and shield removing tool, and (5) torque <b>wrench</b> <b>adapter</b> for cable connector engaging ring. Diagrams of the various tools and devices are provided...|$|E
50|$|Spin disks {{are usually}} a flat round disk, {{commonly}} of plastic, with a square {{hole in the}} middle to fit over the socket <b>wrench's</b> male <b>adapter</b> plug. The edges are grooved for a solid grip.|$|R
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque <b>wrench</b> tool <b>adapter</b> that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R
