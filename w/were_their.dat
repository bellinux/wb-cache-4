5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes <b>were</b> <b>their</b> own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
5|$|Dalmatian cities {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Mary and Sigismund, not least {{thanks to the}} couple's alliance with Venice. A notable exception was Klis, which supported the rebellious nobleman John of Palisna. Tvrtko {{took control of the}} Klis Fortress in July 1387, which enabled him to launch attacks on Split. Although the Bosnian army laid waste to the areas of Split and Zadar, the cities refused to capitulate. Their officials were willing to honour King Tvrtko but insisted that Queen Mary and King Sigismund <b>were</b> <b>their</b> legitimate sovereigns. Ostrovica Fortress submitted to Tvrtko in November, followed by Trogir.|$|E

During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written. The styles <b>were</b> <b>their</b> most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, who was in a soul band.|$|E

Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
