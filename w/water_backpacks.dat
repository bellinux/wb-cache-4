50|$|The Moscow Times {{wrote on}} 17 August 2010:Volunteers, widely snubbed by {{professional}} firefighters {{because of their}} lack of experience, have saved several villages by using basic shovels and buckets of water and sand. Even after a larger fire is suppressed with a fire hose, the underbrush often continues to burn, and {{a gust of wind}} can ignite it into a blaze once again. Using shovels and <b>water</b> <b>backpacks,</b> volunteers in Yuvino isolated burning groundcover, cleared a fire line around the village, and loaned firefighters a pump to fill their trucks.|$|E
40|$|Access to safe {{drinking}} water is an important health factor in many developing countries. Studies have shown that un{{safe drinking}} water and poor sanitation practices leads to diarrheal disease, {{which is one of}} the leading causes of death of children under five in developing countries. Provision and proper use of household water filters have been shown to effectively improve health. This thesis is focused on the refinement and validation of algorithms for data collected from pressure transducer sensors that are used in household water filters (the Vestergaard Frandsen LifeStraw Family 2. 0) deployed in Rwanda by the social enterprise DelAgua Health. Statistical and signal processing techniques were used to detect the use of the LifeStraw water filters and to estimate the amount of water filtered at the time of usage. An algorithm developed by Dr. Carson Wick at Georgia Institute of Technology was the baseline for the analysis of the data. The algorithm was then refined based on data collected in the SweetLab at Portland State University, which was then applied to field data. Laboratory results indicated that the mean error of the improved algorithm is 11. 5 % as compared with the baseline algorithm mean error of 39 %. The validation of the algorithm with field data yielded a mean error of 5 %. Errors may be attributed to real-world behavior of the water filter, electronic noise, ambient temperature, and variations in the approximation made to the field data. This work also presents some consideration of the algorithm applied to soft-sided <b>water</b> <b>backpacks...</b>|$|E

40|$|The “Gârla Pasarea” was {{a former}} flood plane {{watercourse}} in connection with Vedea River discharged in Danube River. The floodplane was embanked for agriculture polder, Vedea River was redirected to discharge direct into Danube River and Gârla Pasarea was cut in several sectors, connected through underground tubes. Fish fauna inventory of Gârla Pasarea was performed in august 2007, using for shallow <b>water</b> <b>backpack</b> electrofisher and deep large water by Nordic gillnets. The species richness includes 15 fish species with a gradient of increasing from upstream to downstream. The most frequent species (very abundant) are two exotic respectively, Pseudorasbora parva and Carassius gibelio that survive in extreme condition. Four species are included in Annexes of Emergency Order of Romanian Govern No. 57 / 2007, concerning regime of natural protected area,conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna, respectively Aspius aspius, Cobitis danubialis (elangoides) and Misgurnus fossilis are included in Annex 3 that need designate of Special Protected Area for conservation (SPA), andProterorhinus marmoratus (semilunaris) is included in Annex 4 B, for species of national interest that need strict protection. Recovering and conservation of fish fauna need ecological restoration based on rebuilding of longitudinal connectivity of Gârla Pasarea sectors, reconnect with Vedea River and lateral connectivity of Danube River with it former floodplane...|$|R

5000|$|Gene A. Vance Jr. was {{described}} as a 6-foot-4 inches tall [...] "mountaineer"- an avid outdoorsman and physical fitness, mountain biking, white <b>water</b> rafting, <b>backpacking,</b> kayaking, snowboarding and chess enthusiast. He kept much of his military life a secret from friends and family who believed he led what {{was described}} as two lives - a different life than people saw.He loved the Grateful Dead, John Prine and became well known to Dick Dale as one of his fans. He liked to wear Birkenstock sandals and Deadhead T-shirts in sharp contrast to his military life and secret government missions. The reason for Gene's secrecy was believed to be in part due to his modest nature and also to the secretive nature of his elite training as both a cryptologic linguist and a US Special Forces Reservist. Gene had specialty skills in translating intercepted foreign state communications and was honored by the US National Security Agency.|$|R

At [...] per [...] water is exceptionally heavy. [...] It is impossible to carry {{more than a few}} days' supply. [...] Thus provisions for adequate <b>water</b> on a <b>backpacking</b> trip must be made in advance, whether that is knowing of potable sources such as lakes, streams, and springs en route or a means of filtering or purifying tainted water supplies as encountered.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{officials}} {{believed they}} needed more manpower, so CCC crews from Bighorn National Forest, 165 mi to the east, and other districts of Shoshone National Forest started responding by {{the morning of}} August 21. By 12:30 pm, more than 200 firefighters were on duty and involved in digging fire line or {{in support of the}} firefighting effort. Along one of the small creeks flowing into Blackwater Creek, a small dam was constructed to pocket water supplies for use in <b>backpack</b> <b>water</b> pumps. Due to a long overnight journey, the CCC members from the Tensleep District of Bighorn National Forest did not commence response to the fire until after noon on August 21. As they arrived, the Tensleep CCC unit were told to relieve the Wapiti CCC unit that had been fighting the fire since the previous evening. More than 50 firefighters commenced construction of a new fire line along Clayton Creek and Clayton Gulch, a ravine extending east from Blackwater Creek. The construction was led by USFS Rangers Alfred Clayton and Urban Post, and their crews consisted mainly of the Tensleep CCC camp and some from other entities.|$|R
