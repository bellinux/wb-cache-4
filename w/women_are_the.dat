5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> physiological and emotional changes {{associated with the}} cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most anxious, Asian <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most stoic.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to most intestinal helminthiases, where the heaviest parasitic loads tend {{to occur in}} children, hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males.

However, in most endemic areas, adult <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most severely affected by anemia, mainly because they have much higher physiological needs for iron (menstruation, repeated pregnancy).|$|E

25|$|Arguments favoring {{discrimination}} against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western misogynist writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from Formicarius (1435), Preceptorium divinae legis (1475) and Lectiones super ecclesiastes (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.|$|E
