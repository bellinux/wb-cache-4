25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E

2500|$|Nungesser {{complained that}} he had not been allowed to {{introduce}} Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages {{in the days and weeks}} after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: [...] "I feel like we need to have some real time where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> life and thingz, because we still haven't really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr." [...] Sulkowicz says she sent the messages because she was upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.|$|E

Also I feel like we need to have some real time where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> life and thingz [...] because we still haven’t really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr". Sulkowicz confirmed the authenticity and time stamps of the messages, but included her annotations. Sulkowicz believed that Paul sent the message to avoid suspicion and said her response was so that Nungesser would not be scared to discuss the incident.|$|E
2500|$|In a January 4, 2007, {{appearance}} on The Situation Room, Webb articulated {{his position on}} the Iraq War: [...] "What we really {{need to do is to}} get into the arena where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a strategy, talk about the pluses and the minuses of the Baker-Hamilton Commission and work toward a solution that, on the one hand, will allow us to remove our combat troops, but on the other, will increase the stability of the region, allow us to continue to fight against international terrorism and allow us, as a nation, to address our strategic interests around the world. And this is – this is one of the drawbacks that we've had with so many troops having been put into this constant rotational basis inside one country when we have a war against international terrorism that's global." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{point that}} Wittgenstein makes against the {{possibility}} of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside of which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word [...] "beetle". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a [...] "beetle" [...] is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word [...] "beetle" [...] could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object [...] "drops out of consideration as irrelevant". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> something, then it is not private, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot talk about it.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in {{an email}} {{that he did}} not expect {{completion}} of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} I put the {{question}} whether libertarianism has its own ethics, and so <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> libertarian ethics, or rather, it refers to other, existing ethical positions, and that therefore {{we have to deal}} only with the ethics of libertarianism. The subject of discussion will libertarianism in the narrow sense, and I will discuss two of the most representative of the so-understood ethical concepts of libertarianism: Murray N. Rothbard and ans-Hermann Hoppe. As regards ethics we will understand it as an art of individual happy life (eudaimonia). Considerations will lead us to the conclusion that libertarian ethics does not exist, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> only <b>about</b> the ethics of libertarianism, which either refers to the doctrine of natural law, or to the ethics of communication...|$|R
