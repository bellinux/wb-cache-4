5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact <b>with</b> <b>European</b> explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called fa‘atete, a single-headed hand drum called pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed bass drum called tariparau.|$|E
5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz <b>with</b> <b>European</b> classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations {{on the album}} with rhythms and melodies from rock, R, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact <b>with</b> <b>European</b> culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact <b>with</b> <b>European</b> Americans.|$|E
5|$|Balink {{began work}} on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers.

The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success <b>with</b> <b>European</b> audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers.|$|E

5|$|In general, Atlus publishes Megami Tensei {{games in}} Japan and North America, {{but as they}} lack a European branch, they publish titles in the region through {{third-party}} companies such as Ghostlight and NIS America.

5|$|Rupert's contemporaries {{believed}} {{him to have}} been involved in some of the bloodier events of the war, although later histories have largely exonerated him. Rupert had grown up surrounded by the relatively savage customs of the Thirty Years' War in Europe. Shortly after his arrival in England he caused consternation by following similar practices; one of his early acts was to demand two thousand pounds from the people of Leicester for the King as the price of not sacking Leicester. Although in keeping <b>with</b> <b>European</b> practices, this was not yet considered appropriate behaviour in England and Rupert was reprimanded by the King.|$|E
5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms <b>with</b> <b>European</b> beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, and tend {{to appear in the}} summer and autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune pine forests. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, India, Japan, and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore <b>with</b> <b>European</b> influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact <b>with</b> <b>European</b> colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction <b>with</b> <b>European</b> seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion.
