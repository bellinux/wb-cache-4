500|$|Later reviews towards Sex {{have become}} more positive. The authors of The Porning of America: The Rise of Porn Culture, What It Means, and Where <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>from</b> <b>Here</b> (2008) have commented that [...] "the book is {{particularly}} interesting in the way that, like many of Madonna's works, it portrays sex in terms of domination and power", whereas Jane Raphaely, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan praised Madonna's [...] "liberated behavior on Sex [...] {{the fact that she}} takes all forms of pornography and systematically demystifies it by putting it under her control", in an article in 1996. Brian McNair, author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire (2002) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had [...] "porno elegance" [...] and that [...] "Sex is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence". Priya Elan from The Guardian, wrote: [...] "That the Sex book came after a record-breaking album and tour felt like a shrinkwrapped curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique". Elan felt that the book was part of a [...] "slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as 'Oh Father' (from 1989's Like a Prayer) and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in [...] In Bed With Madonna".|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to show {{intergovernmental}} relations at a crossroads. For two decades, the net costs of the federal interaction with state and local governments in the criminal area were absorbed nationally, with the benefits felt locally. Now, the federal commitment to terrorism prevention, and the role federal authorities envision state and local agencies playing in this endeavor demand certain sacrifices and offer uncertain rewards.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Spinoza {{does not take}} {{extension}} in space to be a fundamental property of physical things. This means that when Spinoza calls either substance or a mode “an Extended thing”, he {{does not mean that}} it is a thing extended in three dimensions. The argument proceeds by showing, first, that Spinoza does not associate extension in space with substance, and second, that finite bodies, or physical things, are not understood through the intellect when they are conceived as extended in space. I conclude by articulating some suggestions about where <b>we</b> should <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> in trying to understand Spinoza’s account of the attribute of extension and of the physical world...|$|R

One of these flexibility mechanisms is emissions trading (ET). However, experience is lacking on how such a complex trading system will {{be put in place}} domestically and internationally. National governments and the private sector are beginning to explore ET opportunities. This paper provides an overview of progress in domestic GHG emissions trading {{as well as some of}} the major private sector initiatives, both in Australia and internationally. It concludes with some general observations on where <b>we</b> might <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> to establish a workable and effective ET pilot in Australia...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{diseases}} {{discussed in the}} context of stem cell therapy, those concerning the heart account for almost one-third of the publications in the field. However, the long-term clinical outcomes have been disappointing, in part because of preclinical studies failing to optimize the timing, number, type, and method of cell delivery and to account for shape changes that the heart undergoes during failure. In situations in which cardiomyocytes have been used in cell therapy, their alignment and integration with host tissue have not been realized. Here we review the present status of direct delivery of stem cells or their derivative cardiomyocytes to the heart and the particular challenges each cell type brings, and consider where <b>we</b> should <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{crowdsourcing}} {{has created a}} variety of new opportunities for improving upon traditional meth-ods of data collection and annotation. This in turn has created intriguing new opportunities for data-driven ma-chine learning (ML). Convenient access to crowd work-ers for simple data collection has further generalized to leveraging more arbitrary crowd-based human compu-tation (von Ahn 2005) to supplement automated ML. While new potential applications of crowdsourcing con-tinue to emerge, a variety of practical and sometimes unexpected obstacles have already limited the degree to which its promised potential can be actually realized in practice. This paper considers two particular aspects of crowdsourcing and their interplay, data quality control (QC) and ML, reflecting on where we have been, where we are, and where <b>we</b> might <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here...</b>|$|R

The title of my essay gives away the key questions that I believe we must answer. How have economies in the past developed institutions that have provided the credible commitment that has enabled more complex contracting to be realized; and what lessons can we derive from that experience that will be of value today in the on going process of building or rebuilding economies?...|$|R

It does not cover every area or every finding of GEO- 4, nor does it attempt to summarize these, instead it focuses on some key issues (at global and regional levels) that resonate with challenges faced in forging sustainable paths to development.

40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} the detailed empirical {{results of the}} volume. We have found very strong evidence that {{the basic principles of}} liberal democracy are universally endorsed across Europe, and that Europeans also embrace direct and social democracy. The legitimacy in terms of liberal and direct democracy is high across Europe, the real democratic deficit in Europe concerns the social democratic vision of democracy. It concludes with a few ideas about where <b>we</b> could <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> in the empirical analysis of the ESS dataset on which it is based and which is available to the general public. Future research should analyze the individual items in more detail, study the consequences of the various views and evaluations and link our data to those on personal and social well-being in the same dataset. Finally, our data should be expanded by introducing comparable items in national surveys allowing for country-specific comparisons over time...|$|R
