I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know) that General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made all his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies.

6000|$|These remarks {{are almost}} the {{necessary}} preface to {{a consideration of}} the existence of Shelley and Landor at Oxford--the Oxford of 1793- 1810. Whatever the effects may be on Shelleyan commentators, it must be said that, to the donnish eye, Percy Bysshe Shelley was nothing more or less than the ordinary Oxford poet, of the quieter type. In Walter Savage Landor, authority recognised a noisier and rowdier specimen of the same class. People who have to do with hundreds of young men at a time are unavoidably compelled to generalise. No don, that was a don, could have seen Shelley or Landor as they are described to us without hastily classing them in the category of poets who would come to no good and do little credit to the college. Landor went up to Trinity College in 1793. It was the dreadful year of the Terror, when good Englishmen hated the cruel murderers of kings and queens. Landor was a good Englishman, of course, and he never forgave the French the public assassination of Marie Antoinette. But he must needs be a Jacobin, and wear his own unpowdered hair--the Poet thus declaring himself at once in the regular recognised fashion. [...] "For a portion of the time he certainly read hard, but the results he kept to himself; for here, as at Rugby, he declined everything in the shape of competition." [...] (Now competition is the essence of modern University study.) [...] "Though I wrote better Latin verses than any undergraduate or graduate in the University," [...] says Landor, [...] "I could never be persuaded by my tutor or friends to contend for any prize whatever." [...] The pleasantest and most profitable hours that Landor could remember at Oxford [...] "were passed with Walter Birch in the Magdalen Walk, by the half-hidden Cherwell." [...] Hours like these are indeed the pleasantest and most profitable that any of us pass at Oxford. The one duty which that University, by virtue of its very nature, has never neglected, is the assembling of young men together from all over England, and giving them three years of liberty of life, of leisure, and of discussion, in scenes which are classical and peaceful. For these hours, the most fruitful of our lives, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Oxford, as long as friendship lives; that is, as long as life and memory remain with us. And, [...] "if anything endure, if hope there be," [...] our conscious existence in the after-world would ask for no better companions than those who walked with us by the Isis and the Cherwell.|$|E
