5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where {{developers}} {{showed off}} {{a demonstration of}} the game.

Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E

5|$|Keynes {{himself had}} only limited {{participation}} in the theoretical debates that followed {{the publication of the}} General Theory as he suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring him to take long periods of rest. Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS–LM model (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas). Keynes began to recover in 1939, {{but for the rest of}} his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods Conference.|$|E

Lent flew Dornier Do 215B-5 code R4+DC regularly on Himmelbett missions because of its five-hour endurance. Lent claimed at least four victories in this machine.|$|E
