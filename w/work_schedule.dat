We additionally analyse the effects of sabbaticals because sabbaticals are also increasingly offered by organizations and unlike flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> and telecommuting, sabbaticals do not refer to flexibility in daily work routines (Society for Human Resource Management 2015; Bal and de Lange 2015).|$|R
40|$|In a copper-molybdenum {{open pit}} mine in Chile, a {{collective}} labor dispute in April 2012 halted {{work on the}} site; the main problem was the negotiation of unified <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> for contractors, subcontractors and their own staff. To avoid conflicts that could delay this project, the parties agreed to submit to arbitration by an external agency, to determine and quantify the existence of lost productivity caused by the change of <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> The external agency considered three basic elements: a) the temporal dimension to allow the comparison of two <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> b) the acceptable range of productivity losses associated with these schedules; and c) an unbiased mechanism to allocate a productivity loss within the range associated with each schedule. This paper presents the analysis of productivity loss when <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> are extended, the method utilized, and the results obtained. This probabilistic model randomly assigns discrete values of productivity loss for {{each day of the}} <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> and uses inefficiency ranges from industry research; this allows a non-biased, easy to implement, comparison of <b>work</b> <b>schedules...</b>|$|R
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{school in}} 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey {{tried to get}} a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he {{intended}} to become a greengrocer. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the Co-op, delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique, but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> About a year later, during the 1937–38 season, Ramsey was spotted by Ned Liddell, a scout from Portsmouth, then a well-established top-flight club. Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post. Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again. He spent the next two years working at the Co-op while playing cricket in the summer and football in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The macOS client debuted on June 23, 2015 to {{coincide}} with the release of the first expansion pack. The port was handled by TransGaming. Unlike console and Microsoft Windows PC versions of the expansion, the Mac release is only available in a two-in-one bundle containing the base game and the Heavensward expansion, titled Final Fantasy XIV Online. Current players of other versions of the game, including Mac players running the PC version via Boot Camp, are required to purchase this bundle in order to play using the native Mac client. On July 3, 2015, Square Enix suspended sales of the Mac version because of widespread reports of poor technical performance and offered refunds to those who purchased it. Yoshida observed that the performance issues could be attributed to difficulties in transposing the game from Microsoft's proprietary DirectX graphical rendering libraries to OpenGL as well as a clerical error resulting in publishing the wrong minimum system requirements, both compounded by the hectic <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> demanded by the release of an expansion pack. After new rounds of testing and optimization, sales of the Mac version resumed on February 23, 2016, accompanying the release of Patch 3.2.|$|E
30|$|A {{comparison}} of the effect sizes shows that the effect sizes of sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on organizational attachment are similar. However, the fact that sabbaticals have a significantly stronger effect on organizational attachment than telecommuting indicates that employees consider telecommuting to be less beneficial than sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> As mentioned above, and in contrast to flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> telecommuting presents various disadvantages for employees, such as social and professional isolation. Hence, although both practices offer regular flexibility, employees prefer flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> to telecommuting, because flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> provide daily working time flexibility without the significant drawbacks of telecommuting. Employees may also value sabbaticals more than telecommuting because they allow employees to fulfil personal dreams, like a trip around the world, while still having job security as they do not lose their legal rights as employees.|$|R

5|$|During {{the years}} he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would {{calculate}} the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at {{the climax of the}} Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved {{at the conclusion of the}} manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{the plans}} for three {{different}} versions of the game appeared, the staff realized {{that it was impossible to}} write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of Awakening provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for Birthright extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for Conquest and Revelation, driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for Birthright and Conquest were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in katakana to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the Revelation storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the Senran Kagura series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for Birthright and Conquest. One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on Awakening.|$|E
