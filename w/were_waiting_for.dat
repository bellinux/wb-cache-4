5|$|Louis {{proposed}} to renounce the Kingdom of Naples if Clement dethroned Joanna. After the pope refused, Louis departed {{for his second}} Neapolitan campaign in April 1350. He suppressed a mutiny that occurred among his mercenaries while he and his troops <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the arrival of further troops in Barletta. While marching towards Naples, he faced resistance at many towns because his vanguards, which were {{under the command of}} Stephen Lackfi, had become notorious for their cruelty.|$|E

The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the 61st Battalion {{took part in the}} surrender ceremony that took place at Torokina. Later, as they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> repatriation back to Australia, the battalion was employed guarding Japanese prisoners of war. In November orders arrived for the battalion to return to Australia and after embarking on the Westralia, they landed at Cairns on 19 November 1945, and moved back to Brisbane by train. As the battalion's strength dwindled {{as a result of the}} demobilisation process and men returned to civilian life, the decision was made to disband the unit. This occurred on 8 January 1946 at Victoria Barracks, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Lutyens' {{designs were}} {{complete}} by 1920 and approved in November of that year, {{but as the}} chosen site {{was part of the}} churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a faculty from the Diocese of Peterborough (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation. The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners. Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the Northampton Independent reported that the obelisks had been carved and <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the flags to be painted before they could be erected.|$|E
5|$|A second scandal {{occurred}} in 1936 when Blamey attempted {{to cover up}} details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order {{to cover up the}} identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E

5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one {{of several}} Allied units {{deployed}} to Greece to help prepare for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's reinforcement battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the reinforcement battalion, along with several thousand other, mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with machine-gun fire and self-propelled 6-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|Nos. 610, 615 and 32 Squadrons were {{guarding}} the air space near Biggin Hill. Operating at about 25,000 feet they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the high-altitude force {{to reach the}} area. Unfortunately, the German escort fighters had climbed much higher and they were taken by surprise. JG 3's Bf 109s had been flying extended cover for the 12 Ju 88s and 27 Do 17s of KG 76. They spotted No. 615 below them and bounced the RAF fighters. Oberleutnant Lothar Keller and Leutnants Helmut Meckel and Helmut Landry each destroyed a Hurricane. While 615 had taken grievous losses, it had served an important purpose by keeping the escorting German fighters busy. While they engaged JG 3, Squadron Leader Michael Crossley led No. 32 Squadron against I. and III./KG 76 bombers without {{having to worry about}} enemy fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, {{most of the}} Union troops {{departed}} Fort Henry, {{where they}} <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the return of Union gunboats {{and the arrival of}} additional troops that would increase the Union forces to about 25,000 men. The Union forces proceeded about 5 miles (8km) on the two main roads leading between the two forts. They were delayed most of the day by a cavalry screen commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest's troops, sent out by Buckner, spotted a detachment from McClernand's division and opened fire against them. A brief skirmish ensued until orders from Buckner arrived to fall back within the entrenchments. After this withdrawal of Forrest's cavalry, the Union troops moved closer to the Confederate defense line while trying to cover any possible Confederate escape routes. McClernand's division made up the right of Grant's army with C.F. Smith's division forming the left. USS Carondelet was the first gunboat to arrive up the river, and she promptly fired numerous shells into the fort, testing its defenses before retiring. Grant arrived on February 12 and established his headquarters near {{the left side of the}} front of the line, at the Widow Crisp's house.|$|E
5|$|Some Australians {{decided to}} delay their {{departure}} and instead joined the British Army {{and went on}} to serve in Northern Russia during the Russian Civil War, although officially the Australian government refused to contribute forces to the campaign. HMAS Yarra, Torrens, Swan and Parramatta served in the Black Sea during the same conflict. Elsewhere, in Egypt in early 1919, a number of Australian light horse units were used to quell a nationalist uprising while they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> passage back to Australia. Despite shortages in shipping, the process of returning the soldiers to Australia was completed faster than expected and by September 1919 there were 10,000 men still left in Britain waiting for repatriation. The last of the main transports conveying Australian troops left England on 23 December 1919, arriving in Australia in early 1920. A year later, on 1 April 1921, the AIF was officially disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The HNC, {{which had}} representatives {{from a wide}} range of social groups, {{selected}} the aging civilian politician Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Suu chose Trần Văn Hương as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Khánh and the senior generals retained the real power. At the same time, a group of Catholic officers were trying to replace Khánh with their co-religionist, General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, and the incumbent was under pressure. During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting. In the meantime, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> stability in the south before starting the air strikes.|$|E
