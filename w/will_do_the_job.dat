25|$|In {{the fifth}} season opener, Max proposes to Naomi after leaving his bride-to-be {{standing}} at the altar. They elope and get married. When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as {{he seems to be}} the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer. Bryce accepts the position but manages to fire Max, which was set up by Alec. He later admits to Naomi that he is in love with Max, who in the meantime has left for a gamer conference in Iceland. Naomi finds out that he had been hiding at his parents' house. The couple seeks the help of a marriage counselor. Max explains he didn't want Naomi to run his life and the counselor says that Naomi lost herself. The pair later agrees to divorce and Max decides to go back to MIT. Naomi finds her and Annie's half brother, Mark Holland (Charlie Weber), a chef who owns a gourmet food truck. After he doesn't {{want anything to do with}} her, Naomi decides to host a band and food truck contest at CU and sabotages it to let Mark win. Mark is initially upset with Naomi but agrees afterwards to open a restaurant with her after Annie talked to him.|$|E

"Now, as {{you write}} a capital hand, {{and know how to}} express {{yourself}} on paper," [...] continued Hardy, [...] "it strikes me that you <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> better than any one else; and, being a friend, I feel that I can talk freely to you on my private affairs. So you'll help me?" ...|$|E
50|$|Some Further Education colleges {{also have}} {{small numbers of}} sabbatical {{officers}} but these are rare, partly due to funding restrictions. Often the executive members of the students' association of these bodies <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> whilst still studying.|$|E
5000|$|... {{means that}} machine [...] <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> three <b>jobs</b> [...] in <b>the</b> order , while machine [...] <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> in <b>the</b> order [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} {{tools for}} thaeng yuak are the sharp carving knives, hammer, and nail. For carving knives, {{each type of}} knife <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> different <b>job</b> and have different properties for the work.|$|R
50|$|The nuclear {{materials}} Ulof needs to better his invisibility machine are extremely rare and kept under guard in government facilities. Krenner arranges the prison break of a notorious safecracker, Joey Faust (Douglas Kennedy), {{to steal the}} materials he needs. Of course Faust <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> while invisible. Krenner offers Faust money for <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> and Faust expresses his grievances against working for him. Faust tells him that he will sing like a canary if he is returned to prison, but Krenner informs Faust that he is wanted dead or alive, so Faust reluctantly complies. However, when he meets Faust’s woman, Laura Matson (Marguerite Chapman), he slowly charms her into a double cross.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a {{swinging}} door that is {{stopped by a}} doorstop placed 2/3 of {{the width of the}} door <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with minimal shaking of the door because the hinged end is subjected to no net reactive force. (This point is also the node in the second vibrational harmonic, which also minimizes vibration.) ...|$|E
50|$|Two men on {{a remote}} space station, which {{receives}} its equipment from Earth unassembled, waste large amounts of time assembling the devices which are shipped to them, {{and they can not}} adequately build their equipment because the shipments are accompanied by vague and confusing instructions. They eagerly await the arrival of a complex and sophisticated assembly robot that <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for them.|$|E
5000|$|The delayed {{reaction}} of the French youth {{has a lot to}} do with President François Hollande. In 2011 and 2012, when Occupy was the rallying cry of many cities, giving rise to political movements such as Podemos in Spain, the French were looking forward to electing a Socialist president instead of the highly unpopular Nicolas Sarkozy. Why occupy when the polls <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job?</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Low-bid {{selection}}: This selection {{focuses on}} the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are <b>willing</b> to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for. Then <b>the</b> owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for them.|$|R
50|$|Devices are {{available}} to convert from composite to other standards such as analog VGA or digital HDMI; such devices may be called upscalers or scan converters, although not all devices with these names will handle composite input. Price and quality vary. A converter with electronics is necessary; a simple cable <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the Balanced Scorecard {{has become}} very popular, {{there is no single}} version of the model that has been universally accepted. The {{diversity}} and unique requirements of different enterprises suggest that no one-size-fits-all approach <b>will</b> ever <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Gamble, Strickland and Thompson (2007, p. 31) list ten financial objectives and nine strategic objectives involved with a balanced scorecard.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} game, a dealer is chosen by an {{arbitrary}} method. A typical method is {{for everyone to}} draw randomly one card from a face down pile to compare ranks, with the highest rank being the dealer. For subsequent games, {{the winner of the}} previous game will be the dealer, and the player {{to the left of the}} winner <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of mixing the played cards to set up the draw pile.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{desirability}} of a given method, the information required may not be collectible due to interfering circumstances. The most desirable platform may not be available; weather and enemy air-defense might limit the practicality of UAVs and fixed-wing IMINT platforms. If air defense is the limitation, planners might request support from a national-level IMINT satellite. If a satellite <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> the orbits of available satellites may not be suitable for the requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the conference room pilot is to {{validate}} a software application against the business processes of end-users of the software, by allowing end-users to use the software to carry out typical or key business processes using the new software. A commercial advantage of a conference room pilot {{is that it may}} allow the customer to prove that the new software <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> (meets business requirements and expectations) before committing to buying the software, thus avoiding buying an inappropriate application. The term is most commonly used in the context of 'out of the box' (OOTB) or 'commercial off-the-shelf' software (COTS).|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In sharp {{contrast}} with the post-war period, over the last 10 years income per head in the EU has begun to decline in comparison {{to that of the}} US. Against this background, the revival of growth and pro-ductivity has become an overriding priority of European policymakers. While fostering innovation has become a necessity in Europe, R&D investments alone <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} {{is in the}} consistency with which common constructs, even those that generalize across cultures, predict across different countries and cultures. For example, those who seem high in Agreeableness can do less well on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in European workplaces. But those high in Agreeableness in the USA or Japan <b>will</b> <b>do</b> better on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> as measured on the same criteria. In some cases the structured Behavior Description Interview (BDI) that predicts who <b>will</b> <b>do</b> well on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in some countries, from their interview scores, fails to predict accurately which applicants to hire in other countries.|$|R
5000|$|Conduct {{is mainly}} about willingness, {{which can be}} failure to use talent through laziness or carelessness, or misbehaviour. In other words, <b>the</b> {{employee}} <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> intransigent type of inflexible employee, or malingerer, could be fairly dismissed on grounds of conduct, capability or SOSR. Misconduct has been distinguished from incapability as being [...] "a failure to exercise to the full such talent as is possessed".|$|R
5000|$|As in Mr. Do!, {{the player}} can earn an extra life by {{collecting}} {{all of the}} letters from the word [...] "EXTRA". Regular monsters can be changed into monsters bearing the EXTRA letters by collecting all three keys distributed around the playfield and then picking up a magic shield from the top floor. Monsters in this state are easier to defeat than normal; a simple hammer strike <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> After a brief interval, they change back into their normal forms. The game also offers a bonus credit for collecting a rare diamond that appears on the playfield at random intervals.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth part are charms {{to counter}} the divine Nagas or their messengers. The charm {{to counter the}} Nagas Anantaka (Ananta), Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkotaka (Karkota), Pulika, Shakha(ka), Padma(ka), Mahapadma(ka), Gulika, Kulika, Paundra, Kalika, Elapatraka (Ela) and Nagaka are told. The charm is {{repeated}} many times starting {{with the name of}} the Naga it counters. The charm which partly appears in the [...] "Incantations" [...] part of the Upanishad. [...] "He moves", referring to Garuda; then [...] "she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> destroy the poison" [...] and the poison is declared destroyed. The destruction of poison is again associated to Indra's weapon (Vajra).|$|E
5000|$|The Boolean set {{operations}} can {{be implemented}} in terms of more elementary operations ( [...] , , and [...] ), but specialized algorithms may yield lower asymptotic time bounds. If sets are implemented as sorted lists, for example, the naive algorithm for [...] will take time proportional to the length m of S times the length n of T; whereas {{a variant of the}} list merging algorithm <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in time proportional to m+n. Moreover, there are specialized set data structures (such as the union-find data structure) that are optimized for {{one or more of these}} operations, at the expense of others.|$|E
50|$|Christian ends up overhearing Dallas tell Rusty that he won't {{go through}} with the plan with Christian, but <b>will</b> still <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with Rubin. Christian follows Dallas and Rubin on their robbery job, {{and it turns out}} that they are robbing Bear. After Rubin goes inside, Dallas decides to go after him to get the proper share of the $150,000. They end up getting killed trying to rob Bear.|$|R
40|$|Proponents of {{free markets}} for {{electricity}} assert that minor fixes to the California market and to FERC 2 ̆ 7 s proposed Standard Market Design would generate lower prices. We disagree. Designing {{a competitive market}} that remedies the problems seen in California and other restructured markets is difficult; emulating even good ISOs like PJM <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Each {{one of the problems}} can be overcome, but <b>the</b> costs of <b>doing</b> so might make full deregulation unattractive...|$|R
25|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} {{are removed from}} residual, crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure. A simpler and less expensive purification system <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same <b>job</b> for light crude and light distillates. A magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present. Fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel-treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable, low-maintenance operation of gas turbines.|$|R
50|$|When {{used as a}} door {{breaching}} system, {{the shotgun}} may be provided with a muzzle extension {{to allow it to}} be pressed firmly against the door while providing the correct standoff distance for optimum performance. While there are specialized rounds for breaching doors with minimal hazard to any occupants of the room, any type of round <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> though with some degradation of effectiveness and increased risk of collateral damage. In operations in Iraq, the shotgun was the preferred method of door breaching by infantry units, ideally with a frangible breaching slug. For the breaching role, shorter barrels are preferred, as they are more easily handled in tight quarters.|$|E
50|$|Walter and Saul meet Jesse at a laser tag arcade; Victor {{is parked}} nearby and watches Walter and Saul enter. Walter informs Jesse of his situation, and {{explains}} that when Gale is {{confident enough to}} take over, they will be disposed of. Walt decides they must kill Gale. Jesse begs Walter {{to go to the}} police or the DEA, but Walt refuses. He reasons that Gus can't stop production, and with Gale out of the picture, Gus would {{have no choice but to}} keep Walt. Jesse says he is not a murderer and can't kill Gale. Walt says he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> and Jesse only needs to find Gale's address, as Walt is being heavily watched and can't manage it. Later that evening, Jesse calls Walt at home with Gale's address.|$|E
5000|$|Following his retirement, Grivas {{focused on}} the idea of ridding Cyprus of British colonial rule and annexing it to Greece (Enosis). As a member of the secret Committee for the Cyprus Struggle he took the oath of Enosis {{together}} with the newly elected Archbishop Makarios III, with whom he collaborated for preparing the armed struggle. He arrived secretly in Cyprus in November 1954 and began immediately the formation of his guerrilla organisation EOKA. On 1 April 1955 with a declaration that he signed as DIGENIS and a number of bombings against various targets in the four major cities and military installations, he announced the beginning of his campaign for Self Determination - Union with Greece.

50|$|In 2011, LivePerson {{was named}} one of Fortune’s 100 Fastest Growing Companies and one of Forbes’ 25 Fastest Growing Tech Companies. LoCascio {{currently}} employs over 1,000 people worldwide, and credits his recruiting philosophy as a main element in the company’s success. He looks for two things: skill and will. In an article for Inc Magazine, he wrote “The most valuable employees {{are the ones that}} have more than the right skills for <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> They have <b>the</b> <b>will</b> to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with passion.|$|R
50|$|After the Germs {{recorded}} for Chris D.'s Tooth and Nail compilation in late 1978, the (GI) sessions {{took place in}} 1979 at Quad Teck recording studio in Los Angeles. Lead singer Crash had originally wanted former Paul Revere & the Raiders vocalist Mark Lindsay to produce, but while Lindsay was <b>willing</b> to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> {{he turned out to}} be too expensive for Slash Records to afford. Joan Jett, a longtime friend and heroine of many of the band members since her time in the Runaways, was asked to produce the album.|$|R
40|$|If society’s {{goal is to}} {{increase}} people’s feelings of well-being, economic growth in itself <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Full employment and a generous and comprehensive social safety net do increase happiness. Such policies are arguably affordable not only in higher income nations but also in countries that account {{for most of the}} population of the less-developed world. These conclusions are suggested by an analysis of a wide range of evidence on happiness in countries throughout the world. (JEL I 31, I 38, O 21, F 20, D 60, E 60) I...|$|R
5000|$|In Tonga, kava is like {{alcohol and}} drunk nightly at kalapu (Tongan for [...] "club"), {{which is also}} called a faikava ("to do kava"). Only men are allowed to drink the kava, {{although}} women who serve it may be present. The female server is usually an unmarried, young woman called the [...] "toua." [...] In the past, this was a position reserved for women being courted by an unmarried male, and much respect was shown. These days, {{it is imperative that}} the toua not be related to anyone in the kalapu, and if someone is found to be a relative of the toua, he (not the toua) will leave the club for that night; otherwise the brother-sister taboo would make it impossible to talk openly, especially about courtship. Foreign girls, especially volunteer workers from overseas are often invited to be a toua for a night. If no female toua can be found, or it is such a small, very informal gathering, one of the men <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of serving the kava root; this is called fakatangata ("all-man").|$|E
5000|$|The {{floppy disk}} drives on these models {{were in the}} unusual 3-inch [...] "compact floppy" [...] format, which was {{selected}} as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives. In the range's early days supplies of 3-inch floppies occasionally ran out, but by 1988 the PCW's popularity encouraged suppliers to compete for this market. There are several techniques for transferring data from a PCW to an IBM-compatible PC, some of which also can transfer in the opposite direction, and service companies that <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for a fee.While all the 3-inch disks were double-sided, the PCW 256's 3-inch drive and the PCW 8512's upper one were single-sided, while the 8512's lower one was double-sided and double-density. Hence there were two types of disk: single-density, which could store 180 KB of data per side, equivalent to about 70 pages of text each; and double density, which could store twice as much per side. The double-density drive could read single-density disks, but it was inadvisable to write to them using this drive. Users of single-sided drives had to flip the disks over to use the full capacity.|$|E

Either one <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> They mount it on a block of wood for a grip, with friction tape, and then they rig a rubber-band-and-metal-firing-pin device that will drive the [...]22 bullet down that percolator stem or antenna shell, and kill another teen-ager. What they don't bother {{to tell you is}} that a zip-gun is the most inaccurate, poorly-designed, dangerous weapon of the streets. Not only dangerous to the victim, but equally dangerous to the assailant, for too often the zip will explode in the firer's hand, too often the inaccuracy of the home-made handgun will cause an innocent bystander to be shot. It is a booby trap of the most innocent-seeming sort, and there are many kids in Brooklyn (or in Queens, Long Island City and Astoria, where the Kicks, another club much given {{to the use of the}} zip, roam) with only two or three fingers on a hand, from having snapped that rubber band against the metal firing pin." ...|$|E
50|$|U.S. paper {{tanks were}} {{developed}} by Col. Bob Shafer and Col. Cass Hough, who spent many hours developing a 110-gallon (416 litre) paper tank, then getting them into series production at Bowater-Lloyds of London, {{only to be told}} by experts at Wright Field paper tanks are absolutely unfeasible and <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for which they are intended.

50|$|Though he {{was less}} {{successful}} in 1902, with only 459 runs {{at an average of}} 20.86, {{before the start of the}} 1903 season he was appointed the Surrey captain following the resignation from the post of Digby Jephson. In those days, the convention was that the captain had to be an amateur, and Surrey were unable to find one <b>willing</b> to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> who had greater experience or who was a stronger player.

50|$|Riverdales was {{recorded}} in January 1995 at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana with producer and engineer Mass Giorgini. Foster later called Billie Joe Armstrong, vocalist/guitarist for the punk rock band Green Day, in February {{and asked him to}} mix the album. Although <b>willing</b> to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Armstrong could not go to Indiana because his wife Adrienne was about to give birth to their son Joey. Schafer decided to travel to Berkeley, California and Armstrong mixed the album at The Catbox Studios. The album was mastered by Stephen Marcussen in April 1995 at Precision Mastering in Hollywood, California.|$|R
