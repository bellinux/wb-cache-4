Based on our studies and theorists we have come to a conclusion that Google does not have any political character, but they have the opportunity to make political choices, because of the amount of users worldwide. We have also come to a conclusion, that not many people are aware of the fact that Google sorts your information based on your previous search history, and that the “filter bubble” society thereby might be reality.

And yet again, they have come out with another {{original}} concept called Kisko Milega Cash- a game show where the contestants need to do just one simple thing, justify why they are in need of cash.Speaking about the concept of the show and what drove him to come up with such a unique concept, Ravinath Menon, EVP and GM, Star One, says, “This show is one of a kind. And Star One has always been known for presenting its viewers with something that is exciting and apart from the norm, and we aim to do the same with Kisko Milega Cash. The whole show is about being for the people and by the people. Hence we decided to make it a in-house production. It is for real people with real needs.The main concept of the show is to award prize money to people who are actually in need of it. Each set of contestants, 3 per episode, are chosen by our creative team and will be judged by the viewers through SMS’s, in totality.”Further on the concept, he adds, “We will give each contestant a minute to tell India their needs and why they should win the money. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be <b>doing</b> an extensive research on each of the contestants to verify the authenticity of the needs by questioning their neighbours, friends and family. It will be a 28 episode show, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be showing the first 20 episodes with three contestants each. The rest of the 8 episodes will be like a bumper episode where-in <b>we</b> <b>will</b> take contestants whose needs cannot be satisfied within five lakhs and here the winning prize will be 25 lakhs. If the show is appreciated by the audience, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> plan on bringing out another season of it. And each episode will showcase contestants from different walks of life.”Vinod Sherawat, the host, says about the show, “There are a lot of talent shows happening on television, but no-one has come up with such a concept for a game show. All other shows have only been about making a rich celebrity richer, but this show is all about helping common man to fulfill his desires and dreams.” ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} {{properties}} of Wigner matrices. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> give proofs for two fundamental limit theorems of random Hermitian matrices. One of them is Wigner's semicircular law which states that {{the distribution of the}} eigenvalues approaches the Wigner's semicircular distribution when the size of the matrix increases. The other, Bai-Yin theorem, tells that the operator norm of such n × n matrix is almost surely (2 +o(1)) √(n). In Chapter 1 we begin by introducing Wigner matrices and deduce the proper normalizing factor. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> consider what <b>does</b> it mean for the distribution of the eigenvalues to converge by demanding that the empirical spectral distribution should converge almost surely in weak topology. In Chapter 2 we introduce the Stieltjes transform, a useful tool for finding the limit measure. We prove some basic properties and prove that the weak convergence of measures is equivalent to the convergence of their Stieltjes transforms. In Chapter 3 we prove the Wigner's semicircular law. The proof is based on using the Stieltjes transform, and contains several steps. First we find the pointwise expectation of the Stieltjes transform by deriving a polynomial equation for it. While deriving this equation we use several techniques and theorems from both probability theory and linear algebra, covered in the appropriate Appendix. After deducing that the expectation converges, we see quite straightforwardly that the pointwise limit is in fact almost sure. From this we deduce that the empirical spectral distribution of the Wigner matrix converges to the Wigner's semicircular distribution. We begin Chapter 4 by concluding the lower bound in Bai-Yin theorem directly by the semicircular law. For upper bound, we can split the matrix into three parts and use triangle inequality. The diagonal part is easily seen to grow slower than √(n). The part with smaller elements is estimated using even moments and combinatorics to see that it has the wanted upper bound. Finally the part containing all large elements is almost surely sparse, and therefore its operator norm grows slower than √(n) ...|$|R

This article aims at not only discuss this long poem in the context of that vanguard, but also to place it in Sá Carneiro’s oeuvre, which was decisively influenced by the friendship, in the last four years of his short life, with Fernando Pessoa, of what an extensive and valuable correspondence is proof of.

This situation can for example be found in an article on interpolation of Hardy-type inequalities by Krugljak, Maligranda and Persson. We will in this paper define functors Jθ,p;Γ such that T 0 and T 1 interpolate to a map T:Jθ,p;Γ(X¯) →Jθ,p(Y¯).

Their results will follow as corollaries to the more general results of this article and our new theory can be thought of as a theory for generalized subcouples of codimension one. In the last section, we apply our theory to a situation considered by Krugljak, Maligranda and Persson in connection with Hardy-type inequalities.

More specifically we will examine how the newspapers have framed the refugee crisis in both periods. The {{first part of this}} project will explain the given notions on framing by professor Robert Entman, and furthermore explain how metaphors affect readers point of view on refugees by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff. Secondly we will present a quantitative content analysis which helps us to examine the frames by the given newspapers and seek the possible differences between the two periods. This part will focus on showing the categorization of certain aspects that work through a selection of the chosen empiricism. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>do</b> an analysis on the metaphors that we have found in our data, we will be using a qualitative textual analysis to examine the metaphors and thereby understand them as ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ regarding refugees. In this examination we have found some differences in Berlingske and Politikens way of framing the two refugee crises. This is expressed by some new specific dominating frames in 2015 compared to 1993. It is also expressed by differences in the way the newspapers frame refugees as subjects or objects. To understand the basis and perspective of framing we have included theory of science to show our reflections on this project. Finally, we will discuss our results and show the limitation on framing by understanding the historical and cultural contexts, furthermore include the ideological aspects of the newspapers...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis we will consider two mathematical models on malaria transmission and patho- genesis. The transmission model is a human-mosquito interaction model that describes the development of malaria in a human population. It accounts for the various phases of the disease in humans and mosquitoes, together with treatment of both sick and partially im- mune humans. The partially immune humans (termed asymptomatic) have recovered from {{the worst of the}} symptoms, but can still transmit the disease. We will present a mathematical model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the evolution of humans and mosquitoes in a range of malarial states. A new feature, in what {{turns out to be a}} key class, is the consideration of reinfected asymptomatic humans. The analysis will include establishment of the basic reproduction number, R 0, and asymptotic analysis to draw out the major timescale of events in the process of malaria becoming non-endemic to endemic in a region following introduction of a few infected mosquitoes. We will study the model to ascertain possible time scale in which intervention programmes may yield better results. We will also show through our analysis of the model some evidence of disease control and possible eradication. The model on malaria pathogenesis describes the evolution of the disease in the human host. We model the effect of immune response on the interaction between malaria parasites and erythrocytes with a system of delay differential equations in which there is time lag between the advent of malaria merozoites in the blood and the training of adaptive immune cells. We will study the model to ascertain whether or not a single successful bite of an infected mosquito would result in death in the absence of innate and adaptive immune response. Stability analysis will be carried out on the parasite free state in both the immune and non immune cases. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>do</b> numerical simulations on the model to track the development of adaptive immunity and use asymptotic methods, assuming a small delay to study the evolution of the disease in a naive individual following the injection of small amount of merozoites into the blood stream. The effect of different levels of innate immune response to the pathogenesis of the disease will be considered in the simulations to elicit a possible immune level that can serve as a guide to producing a vaccine with high efficacy level...|$|E
