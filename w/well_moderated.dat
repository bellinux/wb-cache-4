25|$|Inherent safety. LFTR designs use {{a strong}} {{negative}} temperature coefficient of reactivity to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The first is that thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the graphite moderator, that usually causes a positive contribution to the temperature coefficient. The third effect {{has to do with}} thermal expansion of the fuel. If the fuel overheats, it expands considerably, which, due to the liquid nature of the fuel, will push fuel out of the active core region. In a small (e.g. the MSRE test reactor) or <b>well</b> <b>moderated</b> core this reduces the reactivity. However, in a large, under-moderated core (e.g. the ORNL MSBR design), less fuel salt means better moderation and thus more reactivity and an undesirable positive temperature coefficient.|$|E

40|$|Satellite ocean color {{missions}} {{require an}} abundance of high-quality in situ measurements for bio-optical and atmospheric algorithm development and post-launch product validation and sensor calibration. To facilitate the assembly of a global data set, the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view (SeaWiFS) Project developed the Seafaring Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS), a local repository for in situ data regularly used in their scientific analyses. The system has since been expanded to contain data sets collected by the NASA Sensor Intercalibration and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Project, as part of NASA Research Announcements NRA- 96 -MTPE- 04 and NRA- 99 -OES- 99. SeaBASS is a <b>well</b> <b>moderated</b> and documented hive for bio-optical data with a simple, secure mechanism for locating and extracting data based on user inputs. Its holdings are available {{to the general public}} {{with the exception of the}} most recently collected data sets. Extensive quality assurance protocols, comprehensive data and system documentation, and the continuation of an archive and relational database management system (RDBMS) suitable for bio-optical data all contribute to the continued success of SeaBASS.

40|$|Online {{communities}} are fast becoming a major {{aspect of the}} daily lives of {{millions of people around the}} world. Determining what makes an online community successful is therefore crucial for developers and designers. Why do some succeed and some fail? In order to study these questions, an online academic community was created for students in an interdisciplinary doctoral program at a major university in the United States. Because the program serves working adults with a variety of research interests, it is difficult for members to get together to discuss ideas and socialize. Students expressed the desire for an online community with a discussion board to facilitate communication. A community-centered design approach (Preece, 2000), that involved the students in all aspects of community design and development, was used to create the community. An action research approach, using quantitative and qualitative methods, was used to assess the success of the community. Data was collected through surveys, observations, and interviews and indicated that 25. 6 % of all members actively participate in discussions, 12. 7 % never visit the discussion board and 61. 7 % are occasional readers. Most participants indicate that the purpose of the community should be narrowly focused to fit their particular interest. They emphatically indicate that the discussions should relate to their own specific area, be lively and <b>well</b> <b>moderated.</b> This study reveals that a narrow purpose appears to be the strongest indicator of success for an online community. The purpose brings them in to the community, but lively, interesting discussions keep them coming back...|$|E

The purpose of the experiment reported here was to measure the increase in {sup 235 }U critical concentration and, hence, the increase in critical mass due to the increase in the {sup 238 }U content in the 69. 2 -cm-diam sphere. The U(37) O{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } concentration in an aqueous solution was adjusted to that when an aluminum spherical vessel was completely filled and the multiplication factor was greater than unity and the excess reactivity was measured by means of a positive reactor period.

40|$|Background: CDX 2 is a caudal {{homeobox}} gene essential for intestinal differentiation and is specifically expressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Its role in colorectal carcinogenesis {{is not fully}} elucidated. Aims and Objectives: To study the expression pattern of CDX 2 and Ki- 67 in different grades of colorectal adenocarcinomas and to observe the relationship of their staining patterns in various tumor stages and to look for correlation if any, between Ki- 67 labeling index (Ki- 67 LI) and CDX 2 expression. Materials and Methods: A total of 74 cases were enrolled. Detailed clinical profile, peroperative findings, histological grading and staging were noted. Immunohistochemistry for CDX 2 and Ki- 67 was done, and Ki- 67 LI was calculated. CDX 2 staining was graded semi-quantitatively, and statistical analysis was done. Result: Age of presentation ranged from 20 to 75 years, and the male:female ratio was 1. 83 : 1. There were 8, 47 and 13 cases of <b>well,</b> <b>moderate</b> and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, respectively. The mean Ki- 67 LI of <b>well,</b> <b>moderate</b> and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas were 14. 25, 31. 34 and 43. 08 respectively, and their difference was statistically significant, correlation was also noted with stage. CDX 2 expression appeared to be stronger in poorly differentiated cases, {{but there was no}} significant difference in its expression in the different grades and stages. There was no correlation between Ki- 67 LI and CDX 2 immunostaining pattern. The lymph node metastasis showed CDX 2 positivity in all the cases. Conclusion: Expression of CDX 2 does not significantly change with the grade of colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, it is an important diagnostic marker in metastatic colonic lesions. The Ki- 67 LI, on the other hand, showed a strong correlation with histopathological grades...|$|R
