50|$|I {{think that}} was one of the first real {{differences}} that set McDibb’s apart - it was, by David Peele's design, a true “listening room”, as opposed to a bar with music in the background, and performers really dug it. Word got out regionally, probably in large part thanks to Fred and the dance community, and people started coming from Atlanta, Tennessee and beyond. And performers heard and responded - all of a sudden we were able to see Norman Blake, Doc Watson, Taj Mahal, John Sebastian and John Hartford on a regular basis! And since the place only held about 150 seats, there was no bad seat in the house. Plus, there was no “Green Room” for the performers, so they pretty much had to hang out and visit with the fans. It was truly unbelievable, and many a legendary night was experienced.Of course, it wasn’t all folk music and gentle listening. I used to rock the place, with as many as 250 people crammed into that tiny space. I remember exchanging nervous glances <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>dad</b> as the speaker cabinets, placed precariously on top of beer boxes, would sway and rock, as the floor sagged and groaned under so many happy feet. Several times we drank the place dry, but it was really rare for there to be any unpleasant drunkenness or weirdness. Women brought their babies and nursed them on the dance floor, then lined them up on blankets behind the speakers to sleep through the ruckus. Good dogs were always welcome - mine would sleep on the stage to avoid being trampled by dancers. Many winter nights were so cold outside and so hot inside that the windows would drip with condensation, and on more than one occasion the evening would end with a snake line of dancers flooding out onto Cherry Street. It was all very groovy.|$|E
