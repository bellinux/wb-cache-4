5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong {{and that the}} vast distances <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

Marchon started {{producing}} {{some of the}} first detergents in the world. The new detergents <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> success as soap was in short supply due to the war. The company continued producing their own detergents as well as bulk detergent ingredients for other companies after the war. It was taken over by Albright and Wilson, often referred to as 'all bright and shiny', in 1955. The Marchon Works became the town's largest employer when the mines closed down.

25|$|From December 2003 to {{the fall}} of 2004, Weezer {{recorded}} {{a large amount of}} material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. Despite commercial success, Make Believe got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review collator Metacritic. Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to Pinkerton, others, among them Pitchfork's score of 0.4 out of 10, panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.|$|E

Further to the graphical aspects, both facial animation and the animation of characters, such as Nate's [...] "fluid" [...] animations as he performs platforming sections were noted, although the wilder animations of enemies reacting to being shot were over-animated [...] "to perhaps a laughable degree".|$|E

500|$|Antonio Cafiero, a rival of Menem in the PJ, {{was unable}} to amend the {{constitution}} of the Buenos Aires province to run for a re-election. Duhalde stepped down from the vice presidency and became the new governor in the 1991 elections, turning the province into a powerful bastion. Menem also selected famous people with no political background to run for office in those elections including the singer Palito Ortega and racing driver Carlos Reutemann. The elections <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> success for the PJ. After these elections, all of the PJ was aligned with Menem's leadership, {{with the exception of a}} small number of legislators known as the [...] "Group of Eight". The opposition from the UCR was minimal, as the party was still discredited by the 1989 crisis. With such political influence, Menem began his proposal to amend the constitution to allow a re-election. The party did not have the required super majority in the Congress to call for it. The PJ was divided, as other politicians intended to replace Menem in 1995, or negotiate their support. The UCR was divided as well, as Alfonsín opposed the proposal, but governors Angeloz and Massaccesi were open for negotiations. The victory in the 1993 elections strengthened his proposal, which was approved by the Senate. Menem called for a non-binding referendum on the proposal, to increase pressure on the radical deputies. He also sent a bill to the Congress to modify the majority requirements. Alfonsín met with Menem and agreed to support the proposal in exchange for amendments that would place limits on presidential power. This negotiation is known as the Pact of Olivos. The capital city of Buenos Aires would be allowed to elect its own chief of government. Presidential elections would use a system of ballotage, and the president could only be re-elected once. The electoral college was abolished, replaced by direct elections. The provinces would be allowed to elect a third senator; two for the majority party and one for the first minority. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation would have the power to propose new judges, and the Necessity and Urgency Decrees would have a reduced scope.|$|E

[...] Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated. [...] A potlatch would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased. [...] It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting.|$|E
