5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} chronometers stopped. <b>Without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> correct time, {{it was impossible for}} them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches on the basis of Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E
5|$|The French {{mathematician}} Louis Bachelier used a Wiener {{process in}} his 1900 thesis {{in order to}} model price changes on the Paris Bourse, a stock exchange, <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> work of Thiele. It has been speculated that Bachelier drew ideas from the random walk model of Jules Regnault, but Bachelier did not cite him, and Bachelier's thesis is now considered pioneering {{in the field of}} financial mathematics.|$|E
5|$|The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, {{meaning that}} it is not {{designated}} as an integer, character, or any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL {{might not be able to}} automatically resolve to the correct function <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> data types of all parameters, including those for which Null is passed.|$|E

5|$|During {{a period}} of ill health, Susan hits Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) with her car after passing out. Susan is unaware that she has struck Bridget and she leaves the scene. When she realises that she is responsible, Susan confesses and it causes a bitter feud between the Kennedys and the Parkers. However, during Susan's trial, Bridget remembers falling {{into the path of}} the car and that the {{collision}} was unavoidable. Soon afterwards, following a series of incorrect diagnoses, Susan is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Susan is shocked and scared, and Karl and Libby try to help her. Susan collapses at Toadie and Steph's wedding rehearsal and she goes to a multiple sclerosis retreat for professional help. Susan takes sick leave from the school and becomes a journalist for the Erinsborough News. After Libby is told she cannot have any more children, she and Dan decide to try surrogacy. Susan offers to be their surrogate, despite Karl's objections. Paul Robinson finds out about the surrogacy and writes a newspaper article about it, <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> identity of the family involved. When he finds out that Susan is the surrogate, he makes it public. The family face abuse and the hospital board decide to end the programme.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings {{on the left and}} entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists {{to keep an eye on}} their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edward's call. As night fell, Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of silence, the Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.|$|E

25|$|<b>Without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> exact {{measurement}} technique and mathematical method {{used to determine}} thrust for each different rocket, comparisons are often inexact. As the above shows, the specified thrust often differs significantly from actual flight thrust calculated from direct measurements. The thrust stated in various references is often not adequately qualified as to vacuum vs sea level, or peak vs average thrust.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> meaning of scarlet, but understanding scarlet <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
25|$|Hassan-i Sabbah {{was born}} into a Twelver family living in the {{scholarly}} Persian city of Qom in 1056 CE. His family later relocated to the city of Tehran, which was an area with an extremely active Ismāʿīlī Daʿwah. He immersed himself in Ismāʿīlī thought; however, he did not choose to convert until he was overcome with an almost fatal illness and feared dying <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> Imām of his time.|$|E

25|$|In January 2011, the British singer Boy George {{returned}} an 18th-century icon of Christ to the Church of Cyprus {{that he had}} bought <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> origin. The icon, which had adorned his home for 26 years, had been looted from the church of St Charalampus {{from the village of}} New Chorio, near Kythrea, in 1974. The icon was noticed by church officials during a television interview of Boy George at his home. The church contacted the singer who agreed to return the icon at Saints Anargyroi Church, Highgate, north London.|$|E
25|$|In Windows 2000, XP or later, the user's RSA {{private key}} is {{encrypted}} using a hash of the user's NTLM password hash plus the user name – {{use of a}} salted hash makes it extremely difficult to reverse the process and recover the private key <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> user's passphrase. Also, again, setting Syskey to mode 2 or 3 (Syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate this attack, since the local user's password hash will be stored encrypted in the SAM file.|$|E

25|$|Operation Queen was {{not able}} to meet its {{sophisticated}} goals. At the beginning of the offensive, Allied planners envisioned for the offensive to be just a staging point for a deep penetration over the Rur into Germany to the Rhine. After one month of heavy fighting the Americans had barely made it to the Rur. No bridgehead over the river had been made, the Germans still held some portions west of the river and the important Rur dams were still in German hands, threatening any further offensive operations. Even <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> upcoming German offensive, Allied planners estimated the earliest date for a large thrust into Germany for mid-January.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} similarities to the 1996 shelling of Qana, in which over 100 civilians were killed by Israeli anti-personnel shells on a UN compound. In the first case, Israel alleged that it fired <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> compound harbored civilians. The allegation was put into question after evidence came out that, {{at the time of}} the strike, Israel was spying on the compound with two helipcoters and a drone. Both incidents resulted in increased pressure on Israel to declare a cease-fire. Qana's strategic location at the confluence of five major roadways and on the northern edge of Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon may have contributed as to its repeatedly being caught in the crossfire.|$|E
25|$|His {{father taught}} him the {{rudimentary}} elements of music {{theory and the}} basic notions of Solfège, along with his first piano lessons. Despite his manifested precociousness, and even <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> most basic rules of harmony, he began arranging some of Haydn and Mozart's musical compositions for flute, clarion, and cornet, once he was already becoming familiar with some wind instruments such as the clarinet, horn, and oboe, which he learned to play on his own. But without a firm understanding of piano method or further training in composition, his technique became flawed, a problem that persisted throughout his career. Oudrid was then brought by his father {{to the attention of}} composer Baltasar Saldoni, then director of Teatro del Príncipe. Still very young, he was musical director of the Liceo de Badajoz.|$|E
