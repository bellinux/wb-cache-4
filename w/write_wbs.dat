Each MMU contained a 32-entry fully associative {{translation lookaside buffer}} (TLB) that can map 4 KB, 64 KB or 1 MB pages. The <b>write</b> buffer (<b>WB)</b> has eight 16-byte entries. It enables the pipelining of stores. The bus interface unit (BIU) provided the SA-110 with an external interface.|$|R
500|$|All modern {{processors}} have multi-{{stage in}}struction pipelines. Each {{stage in the}} pipeline corresponds to a different action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an N-stage pipeline can have up to N different instructions {{at different stages of}} completion and thus can issue one instruction per clock cycle (...) [...] These processors are known as scalar processors. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a RISC processor, with five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and register <b>write</b> back (<b>WB).</b> The Pentium 4 processor had a 35-stage pipeline.|$|R

However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the characters being brothers. He decided to have the brothers be from Lawrence, Kansas, because of its closeness to Stull Cemetery, a location famous for its urban legends.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{ways to save}} power with Solid-State Drive (SSD) caching. We devise an on-line power {{monitoring}} scheme using the Watts Up? Pro power meter to evaluate our implementation. Our frame-work offers high performance by keeping {{a portion of the}} working set of processes in a local cache, where data can be accessed faster than when it is stored on the storage server disk. Our results indicate that an SSD cache uses less power in <b>Write</b> Back (<b>WB)</b> mode for both cache hits and cache misses. To improve on the initial power sav-ing, we implement a management policy with Least Re-cently Used (LRU) as the replacement policy for work-loads. We also implement a spin down policy to save power on the storage server when there is low disk activ-ity, such as when the cache is large enough to hold the entire working set of running programs. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 42) The aim of {{this project}} is to design a 5 -stage pipelined MIPS processor, using Verilog HDL. The 5 stages being used are Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory (MEM) and <b>Write</b> Back (<b>WB).</b> The instruction set being used is of 32 -bits. The various modules being used are Instruction Memory, Data Memory, ALU, Registers etc. I also have implemented a Forwarding Unit and a hazard detection unit {{for the detection of}} Data hazards. The main goal is to do the complete ASIC flow (RTL to GDS II), using Synopsys design tools. VCS is used for simulation, Synopsys DC Compiler for Synthesis (timing and area are optimized in this step) and Synopsys IC Compiler for Clock tree Synthesis and Place and Route. This report focuses upon, basics of RISC and CISC, MIPS Processor, Hazard detection in MIPS processor and also the simulation and synthesis based results and deductions...|$|R

30|$|In our practice, {{we built}} a {{simulator}} to measure {{the performance of the}} proposed DAWP cache. The simulation is done with 16, 32, and 64 KB cache sizes and six different cache structures, i.e., direct-mapped, 2 -way, 4 -way, 8 -way, 16 -way, and 32 -way set-associative caches. It is assumed in the simulation that the cache uses <b>WB</b> (<b>write</b> back) and write-allocation mechanisms on write-hit and write-miss, respectively. Our simulation model is based on SimpleScalar [15] and CACTI [16], and WP and DAWP cache modules are implemented and ported into the simulator. For performance measurement, we use nine SPEC 2000 programs, which are art, ammp, equake, mesa, mcf, vpr, vortex, gcc, and gzip.|$|R

This is a scholarly and original study constituting a detailed exploration and synthesis of this very important and dynamic field of Australian law. This text reinterprets the conventional focus of administrative law study, judicial review, but also integrates an equally scholarly and discursive study of merits review, freedom of information and ombudsman investigation. Employing a predominantly Federal focus, this book also ensures that relevant State and Territory differences are addressed. The end result is an accessible and unique contribution to public law discourse in Australia, one that crosses {{beyond the confines of}} conventional legal study in this field to present a more comprehensive examination of public sector accountability, and one that crosses jurisdictional boundaries to present a new and illuminating comparison...|$|R

Its first writer was the New Zealand-born Charles Rous-Marten (1844-1908). One of those who shared authorship of the series after his death was the Great Eastern Railway engineer Cecil J. Allen (1886-1973) who became sole author from 1911 until succeeded by O. S. Nock in 1958, when Cecil J. Allen moved his performance column to Trains Illustrated (later renamed Modern Railways), edited by his son, G. Freeman Allen. From 1981 to 2004 the performance series was <b>written</b> by Peter <b>W.B.</b> Semmens (1927-2007), who also served as Chief correspondent from 1990, notably reporting on the Channel Tunnel construction. Authorship of the series, now called just [...] "Practice & performance", has subsequently been shared by Keith Farr and John Heaton.|$|R

Zoonooz first appeared as a column in the San Diego Sun in 1924, <b>written</b> by <b>W.B.</b> France; in 1926 he granted the palindrome title to the Society, who expanded it into a bi-monthly magazine that was free to Society members. To this day, membership in San Diego Zoo Global includes a subscription to Zoonooz, which has now expanded to digital distribution as well as print. In April 1924 Wegeforth created the National Association of Zoological Executives (NAZE), an affiliate of the American Institute of Park Directors, to bring together zoo directors {{from around the country}} to exchange information and animals so they would not have to go through animal dealers. [...] "It seemed preposterous to me", he wrote, [...] "that a group of intelligent zoo directors could not get together and work out a plan whereby they would all know what surplus stock each had available. This thought blossomed in my mind: to have them contact foreign zoos for their mutual benefit, relative to importing such animals as they wanted. And that led me logically to the hope that a number of zoos would collaborate on expeditions, prorating the animals among them ... In addition to saving affiliated zoos tidy sums by eliminating the middlemen, the discussions and exchange of experiences proved of inestimable value." [...] In 1966 NAZE became the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA), a branch of the National Recreation and Park Association, and later became the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the number of cores and nodes in high performance computing (HPC) has made petascale computing a reality with exascale on the horizon. Harnessing such computational power presents a challenge as system reliability deteriorates with the increase of building components of a given single-unit reliability. Today’s high-end HPC installations require applications to perform checkpointing if they want to run at scale so that failures during runs over hours or days can be dealt with by restarting from the last checkpoint. Yet, such checkpointing results in high overheads due to often simultaneous writes of all nodes to the parallel file system (PFS), which reduces the productivity of such systems in terms of throughput computing. Recent work on checkpoint/restart (C/R) has shown that incremental C/R techniques can reduce the amount of data written at checkpoints and thus the overall C/R overhead and impact on the PFS. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it presents the design and implementation of two memory management schemes that enable incremental checkpointing. We describe unique approaches to incremental checkpointing that do not require kernel patching in one case and only require minimal kernel extensions in the other case. The work is carried out within the latest Berkeley Labs Checkpoint Restart (BLCR) as part of an upcoming release. Second, we evaluate the two schemes in terms of their system overhead for single-node microbenchmarks and multi-node cluster workloads. In short, this work is the final showdown between page <b>write</b> bit (<b>WB)</b> protection and dirty bit (DB) page tracking as a hardware means to support incremental checkpointing. Our results show savings of the DB approach over WB approach in almost all the tests. Further, DB has the potential of a significant reduction in kernel activity, which is of utmost relevance for proactive fault tolerance where an immanent fault can be circumvented if DB-based live migrations moves a process away from hardware about to fail. ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the project}} is {{simulation}} and synthesis of the 32 -bit RISC CPU based on MIPS. The project involves design of a simple RISC processor and simulating it. A Reduced Instruction Set compiler (RISC) is a microprocessor that had been designed to perform a small set of instructions, {{with the aim of}} increasing the overall speed of the processor. In this work, we analyze MIPS instruction format, instruction data path, decoder module function and design theory based on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU instruction set. Furthermore, we use pipeline design process to simulate successfully, which involves instruction fetch (IF), instruction decoder (ID), execution (EXE), data memory (MEM), <b>write</b> back (<b>WB)</b> modules of 32 -bit CPU based on RISC CPU instruction set. Function of IF module is fetches the instruction from memory. The function of ID stage is sends control commands i. e., instructions are sending to control unit and decoded here. The EXE stage executes arithmetic. Main component of the EXE stage is ALU. The MEM stage is to fetch data from memory and store data to memory, if instruction is not memory/IO instruction, result is sent to WB stage. At last WB stage charges of writing the results, stores data and input data to register file. The purpose of WB stage is to write data to destination register. The idea of this project was to create a RISC processor as a building block in VHDL than later easily can be included in a larger design. It will be useful in systems where a problem is easy to solve in software but hard to solve with control logic. However at a high level of complexity it is easier to implement the function in software. In this project for simulation we use Modelsim for logical verification, and further synthesizing it on Xilinx-ISE tool using target technology and performing placing & routing operation for system verification. The language we used here is VHDL, and tools required here are MODELSIM III SE 6. 4 b – Simulation XILINX-ISE 10. 1 – Synthesis. The applications are automatic robot control, bottling plant. &# 13; &# 13; Keywords: RISC, MIPS,Simulation Synthesis,Instruction Set,MODELSIM. ...|$|R
