50|$|In words, {{to count}} the number of {{elements}} in a finite union of finite sets, first sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> more than one set, then add back the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> more than two sets, then subtract the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> more than three sets, and so on. This process naturally ends since there can be no elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> more than the number of sets in the union.|$|R

By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.|$|E
