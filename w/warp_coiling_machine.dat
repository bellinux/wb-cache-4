40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the FEM {{analysis}} of the forming process of automotive suspension coil springs. Nowadays in automotive industry great efforts are spent in achieving weight reduction of cars components. The coil springs are not exempt. For this component weight reduction {{can be obtained by}} reducing the spring wire diameter. However, to assure that springs maintain the required mechanical properties, it is necessary to adopt material with high strength [1]. Concerning the manufacturing process of coil springs, the trend is to produce springs by cold forming of strain hardened wires. In this case the wires are subjected to heat treatments of hardening and tempering before the coiling process. This leads to an improvement of productivity since it is not required an heat treatment after forming. However forming a high strength material already hardened and tempered is critical. The material has a very low ductility that can lead to coil's failure during forming process. The process is sensitive both to the process conditions (such as friction), and to the set up of the spring making machine. Aim of this work is the numerical investigation of the coiling process. Different friction conditions and different configurations of the <b>coiling</b> <b>machine</b> are considered. The main target is the determination of a satisfactory lubricant condition and a configuration of the <b>coiling</b> <b>machine</b> which allows the correct production of the spring without any breakage of the wire...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A Fusion Development Facility (FDF) is {{proposed}} {{to fill the}} technological gaps between ITER and a Fusion DEMO. FDF is a steady state copper, water-cooled <b>coil</b> <b>machine</b> with a primary goal to test multiple blanket configurations in its lifetime. For efficient remote exchange of the breeding blankets, it is planned to exchange them through vertical motions in large segments. Two principal remote handling approaches are under study, one exchanging large rings and the second poloidal wedge sections. For either scenario, a joint is required in the toroidal coils {{to allow for the}} vertical blanket exchange. Two approaches to making the joint are under study along with the respective structural models for reacting the magnetic loads. Initial stress analysis is reported showing the structural feasibility of either concept. Coolant flow is important in such a steady state device and manifold and piping layout concepts are developed as part of the remote handling study. The base machine design parameters are reported including size and cooling requirements. The different machine configuration options are presented which consider the design aspects for the machine including alignment of the first wall and divertor, coolant access, and exchange of the blankets...|$|R
