Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{elements}} of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by battle deaths, combat injuries, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of further offensive action and would fight as a defensive force {{for the rest of}} the campaign. Later in November, U.S. forces drove Shoji's soldiers from Koli Point back to the Kokumbuna area, with a battalion-sized Marine patrol attacking and harassing them almost the entire way. Only about 700 of Shoji's original 3,000 men ultimately returned to Kokumbuna.|$|E

At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, {{and for the last}} few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of his}} fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E

The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers.

5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E

In 1963, American support for Diệm collapsed during the Buddhist crisis as Washington concluded that Diệm <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of offering a solid alternative to the communists, and he was overthrown in a US-backed military coup and executed after being captured.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location {{at the crossroads of}} three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August, Porto Alegre {{received}} {{instructions from}} Mitre {{to attack the}} Paraguayan fort at Curuzú. The operation would be carried out {{under the command of}} Tamandaré. Porto Alegre not only refused to defer to his cousin, arguing that both held the same rank, but also warned that he would operate by himself at Curuzú. Porto Alegre <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. Nor was the situation among the allied forces improved once Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa). Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for {{being a member of the}} Conservative Party, while Porto Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff was {{a central}} battery ship {{designed}} by Chief Engineer Josef von Romako. The ship's namesake, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, victor of the Battle of Lissa, had proposed building four new ironclads. These were {{to be completed by}} 1878, but poor economic conditions in the early 1870s forced the Austro-Hungarian government to cut back the naval budget. Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, who succeeded Tegetthoff as the head of naval administration, had attempted to secure funding for two new ships, to be named Tegetthoff and Erzherzog Karl from 1871. Pöck finally succeeded in convincing parliament to allocate funds for the first ship in 1875. He continued to try to convince the parliament to build a sister ship for Tegetthoff until 1880, without success. Austro-Hungarian industry <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of supporting the construction of the ship, and significant components had to be ordered from foreign manufacturers, including guns from Germany and armor plating from Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Stavka {{developed}} {{two major}} operations {{to be conducted}} against Axis forces near Stalingrad, Uranus and Saturn, and also planned for Operation Mars designed to engage German Army Group Center {{in an effort to}} distract reinforcements and to inflict as much damage as possible. Operation Uranus involved the use of large Soviet mechanized and infantry forces to encircle German and other Axis forces directly around Stalingrad. As preparations for the offensive commenced, the attack's starting points were positioned on stretches of front {{to the rear of the}} German Sixth Army, largely preventing the Germans from reinforcing those sectors quickly where Axis units were too overstretched to occupy effectively. The offensive was a double envelopment; Soviet mechanized forces would penetrate deep into the German rear, while another attack would be made closer to the German Sixth Army in an effort to attack German units there directly in the rear. While the Red Army prepared, the German high commanders—influenced by their belief that the Red Army, building up opposite Germany Army Group Center to the north, <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of mounting a simultaneous offensive in the south—continued to deny the possibility of an impending Soviet offensive.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new {{hope that the}} Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal {{to take over the}} running of the south docks. Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Emden {{was assigned to}} training duties once again. She continued in this role until June 1942, by which time a major overhaul was in order. The refit was completed in Wilhelmshaven, after which Emden returned to training cadets. In September 1944, she was deployed to Norway, where she served as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. While in Norway, she participated in several minelaying operations through October, when she was transferred to convoy escort duty; her primary task was to protect convoys {{in and out of}} Oslo. This lasted until December, when she ran aground in the Oslofjord off the island of Flateguri. Her guns were removed while repairs were partially effected in the Schichau-Werke. Before departing East Prussia, she took on the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife to carry them to mainland Germany. They had been disinterred to prevent them from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. The repair work on the ship was not yet completed, and so she was towed to Pillau, where the Hindenburgs' remains were taken off. Emdens engines were put back in working order, though she <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of reaching top speed, and her guns were reinstalled.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} the Dutch Army poorly equipped, it was also poorly trained. There had {{especially}} been little experience gained in the handling of larger units above the battalion level. From 1932 until 1936, the Dutch Army did not hold summer field manoeuvres in order to conserve military funding. Also, the individual soldier lacked many necessary skills. Before the war {{only a minority of}} young men eligible to serve in the military had actually been conscripted. Until 1938, those who were enlisted only served for 24 weeks, just enough to receive basic infantry training. That same year, service time was increased to eleven months. The low quality of conscripts was not compensated by a large body of professional military personnel. In 1940, there were only 1206 professional officers present. It had been hoped that when war threatened, these deficiencies could be quickly remedied but following the mobilisation of all Dutch forces on 28 August 1939 (bringing Army strength to about 280,000 men) readiness only slowly improved: most available time was spent constructing defences. During this period, munition shortages limited live fire training, while unit cohesion remained low. By its own standards the Dutch Army in May 1940 was unfit for battle. It <b>was</b> <b>incapable</b> of staging an offensive, even at division level, while executing manoeuvre warfare was far beyond its capacities.|$|E
