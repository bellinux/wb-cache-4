5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{employed}} {{an active}} and aggressive foreign policy towards strengthening Norwegian ties in the west. His policy relied on friendship and trade with the English king; the first known Norwegian trade agreements were made with England in the years 1217â€“23 (England's first commercial treaties were also made with Norway), and the friendship with Henry III of England was a cornerstone in Haakon's foreign policy. As they had become kings around the same time, Haakon wrote to Henry in 1224 that he <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> could maintain the friendship that had existed between their fathers. Haakon sought to defend the Norwegian sovereignty over the islands in the west, namely the Hebrides and Man (under the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles), Shetland and Orkney (under the Earldom of Orkney), and the Faroe Islands. Further, the Norse community in Greenland agreed {{to submit to the}} Norwegian king in 1261, and in 1262 Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when he managed to incorporate Iceland into his kingdom by utilising the island's internal conflicts in his favour. The dependency on Norwegian maritime trade and their subordination to the Nidaros ecclesiastical province were some of the key reasons which allowed Haakon to assert sovereignty over the islands. The Norwegian kingdom was at the largest it has ever been by the end of Haakon's reign.|$|E

Accompanying Stone at this meeting was her daughter Alice Stone Blackwell, who also was {{an officer of the}} AWSA. Stanton, who was in England at the time, did not attend. The meeting explored several aspects of a possible merger, including the name of the new organization and its structure. Stone had second thoughts soon afterwards, telling a friend she <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had never offered to unite, but the merger process slowly continued.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Wilkinson {{defeated}} Harper {{by a vote}} of 504,674 to 273,141. By capturing 65% of the vote, he broke Julian Carroll's record of 62.8%. Low voter turnout prohibited him from setting the record for most votes received by a candidate in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and he received several thousand fewer votes than Brereton Jones, the victorious Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. He carried 115 of Kentucky's 120 counties [...] besting Carroll's old record of 99 [...] but lost in Fayette, his county of residence. A poll conducted by a Louisville television station after the election showed that 76% of voters <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had another candidate to vote for.|$|E
500|$|Burton biographer Ken Hanke {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of Dolores Fuller. [...] "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," [...] Hanke said, [...] "while Parker's performance presents her {{as a kind of}} sitcom moron for {{the first part of the}} film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes." [...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous.

[...] He called the ending scene [...] "heartbreaking." [...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 9/10, giving particular praise to Jamie Dornan's ability to be [...] "magnetic in every scene." [...] Ratcliffe called his backstory her favorite fairytale of the series up to that point. Television Without Pity's Cindy McLennan <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had not killed Graham, but gave credit to the writers for making her care about him. She concluded, [...] "Episodes like this give me strong hope for {{the second part of}} this season, one-nighters and all. Bring on the pain, boys." [...] She graded the episode with an A.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Cog {{appeared}} on television, Wieden+Kennedy {{received a letter}} from Peter Fischli and David Weiss, creators of the 1987 art film Der Lauf der Dinge. The film was well known in the advertising industry, and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept, but had always declined. The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and [...] "Cog", and warned the agency that they were considering legal action {{on the basis of the}} [...] "commercialisation and simplification of the film's content and the false impression that [...] might have endorsed the use". When interviewed by Creative Review magazine, the pair made clear that they <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had been consulted on the advertisement, and that they would not have given permission if asked. Media publications quickly picked up the story, and asserted that Fischli and Weiss were already in the process of litigation against the car manufacturer.|$|E

He specified [...] "documentary" [...] in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been. The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film. The interviews ran for about ten minutes on {{what it is like to}} lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would [...] "fire" [...] them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> had responded.|$|E
500|$|The Dragon Quest Slime has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans, {{being called the}} [...] "most prolific" [...] of all the [...] "memorable" [...] monsters from the series {{and is one of}} the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the [...] "equivalent of training wheels" [...] due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not feel guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the [...] series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that [...] "The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do." ...|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which {{underlies}} his misbehavior {{and rarely}} leads to any punishment, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children.

500|$|Frusciante {{joined the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988, {{at the age}} of 18, and {{released}} his first album with the group, Mother's Milk the following year. The follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was recorded in an empty mansion that the band decided to live in for the duration of recording. Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up {{the first half of the}} album, Niandra Lades. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991 and was an instant success. The album peaked at number three in the U.S. and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide. Soon after the album's release, Frusciante developed a dislike of the band's newfound popularity. He felt that the band was too famous, and <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he joined the group. By his own admission, the band's rise to popularity took Frusciante by surprise, and he could not cope with it. During Blood Sugar Sex Magik's promotional tour, Frusciante began using heroin and cocaine heavily. He and vocalist Anthony Kiedis often argued before and after performances. According to Kiedis, Frusciante purposely sabotaged the Saturday Night Live performance of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] by playing the wrong intro for the song and out of key. His relationship with the band had become progressively more strained, and he abruptly quit during the Japanese leg of their world tour in 1992.|$|E
