50|$|On {{the north}} side of campus, 29 {{evergreen}} trees stand in two columns forming Memorial Row along {{what used to be the}} path of Van Buren Avenue. The trees, running from the corner of the Oval to Eddy Avenue, were planted in 1919 following the end of the Great War to honor UM students, alumni, and faculty who died in the war, some to combat and many more to the influenza epidemic. The trees are Pinus ponderosa (<b>Western</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Pines</b> or Ponderosa Pine), the state tree of Montana. Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors; in 1925, these were replaced with 35 brass nameplates atop concrete markers. At the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row. It lists 21 of the 31 honorees from 1919. By 1925, the university had increased the number of names on the official list to 35, and sometime later, it grew to 37.|$|R

A variety of other pines, such as Pinus nigra, P. mugo, P. palustris, P. banksiana, P. muricata, and P. radiata have also been reported as hosts to pine-pine gall rust (E. harknessii), but these pine species are considered less valuable. Because E. harknessii is an autoecious short-cycle rust lacking telial a host, {{there is no alternative}} hosts. The pathogen can infect actively growing shoots of any age very quickly without infecting an alternative host, making the disease cycle more destructive that typical rust species that switch between hosts.

40|$|While {{the genus}} Pinus {{has been the}} subject of {{extensive}} mycorrhizal studies there are only a few scattered references to <b>western</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> P. ponderosa, and no detailed descriptive literature on the mycorrhizae of this species. P. ponderosa is indigenous to Nebraska and the one species most extensively grown in local nurseries for windbreaks and farm plantings. Similarly, there is little information on mycorrhizae in the Great Plains between the forested regions of the Mississippi River states and the Rocky Mountains. Because this predominantly grassland area is sparse in natural tree growth the individual tree as an ornamental or in groups as windbreaks becomes of great importance. Under the diverse soil conditions, and with relatively low rainfall and high evaporation and transpiration rates, the survival of transplants is relatively low. The possible role of mycorrhizae in influencing the survival rate has never been investigated in Nebraska. The present study was undertaken to determine in a preliminary way the occurrence and significance of mycorrhizae on the production and survival of ponderosa pine in virgin grassland soils...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} unusual {{interest}} and {{significance in the}} application of ecological principles to the solution of an economic problem has recently been completed. It deals with the causes for the absence of <b>western</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> in brush vegetation of various types that occur throughout the mountainous portions of northern Utah, eastern Idaho, and western Wyoming, and, in fact, form a much interrupted and fragmented belt whose center extends from the Gulf of California to west-central Montana.

40|$|Nearly all {{the ruins}} of {{southern}} Arizona and New Mexico have eluded the efforts {{of those who have}} attempted to date them on the basis of tree-rings. This is due, in the main, to the low altitude in which the ruins occurred and to the consequent distance from the forests where datable trees grew. The trees accessible to the builders of these southern villages were mesquite, ironwood, cottonwood, sycamore, etc., none of which have as yet shown themselves usful in tree-ring studies.
