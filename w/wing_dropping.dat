2500|$|British {{test pilot}} Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown flew Fw 190A-4/U8 jabo version. Brown commented {{the view from}} the cockpit was better than in the Spitfire, P-51 Mustang and the Bf 109 owing to the nose down {{position}} of the aircraft in flight. The sloping frontal windscreen provided 50mm of protection. [...] A further 8mm armoured seat and 13mm head and shoulder armour afforded the Fw 190 pilot great protection. Take off was easy; 10° of flap and power to 2,700rpm and 23.5lb in. boost made the run very similar to the Spitfire IX. Un-stick was found to be 112mph and the fighter had a habit of swinging to port. Speed in the climb was set at 161mph, a rate of 3,000 feet per minute. Brown praised the lack of trimming requirements in flight. However, Brown criticised the lack of trim controls. If a member of the ground crew had moved the tab, or it had been adjusted from another source, it could result in an out-of-trim flight performance at high speeds. Brown praised the high rate of roll. Aileron response was excellent from stall up until 400mph (644km/h), when they became heavy. The elevators were heavy at all speeds, particularly above 350mph (563km/h) when they became heavy enough to impose tactical restrictions on the fighter as regards to pullout from low-level dives. The heaviness was accentuated because of nose down pitch which occurred at high speeds when trimmed for low-speeds. Brown praised the fighter overall; its control harmony [...] was superb. The solid gun platform also made it a potent dogfighter. Brown listed some limitations; it was difficult to read and fly on instruments (why is not explained) and it had harsh stall characteristics. Stall speed was a high 127mph (204km/h). Stall came without warning. The port wing drops violently that the 190 almost inverts itself. If it was pulled into a G-turn it would spin into the opposite banking turn and an incipient spin was the result. Landing stall on the Fw 190 was much more easily dealt with; the intense buffeting resulted in the <b>wing</b> <b>dropping</b> to starboard gently, at roughly 102mph (164km/h).|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{present state}} of {{knowledge}} concerning the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, and several examples {{of the importance of}} the interaction in high-speed flight were described in a previous report 1. It was shown that the major effects arose from, and could be explained in terms of, separation of the boundary layer at or ahead of the shock wave. The present note gives further examples of the consequences in flight of shock-induced separation of the boundary layer; these examples have been derived from data obtained in NACA and British flight tests, and from high-speed wind tunnel experiments. The variation of the pressure coefficient at the trailing edge of the wing has been used to deduce the onset of separation from tile results of the flight tests. It is found that separation occurs on straight wings at approximately the same value of the local Mach number just ahead of the shock as for two-dimensional aerofoils with turbulent boundary layers. For swept wings the available data are inadequate for a detailed comparison. Various features in the "steady-flow " characteristics and buffeting behaviour of the aircraft considered are then shown to be closely associated with boundary-layer separation. These features include <b>wing</b> <b>dropping,</b> loss of control effectiveness, and the "pitch-up " instability which has bee...|$|E
40|$|The Abrupt Wing Stall (AWS) Program has {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} uncommanded lateral motions, such as <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> and <b>wing</b> rock, at transonic speeds. The genesis of this Program was {{the experience of the}} F/A- 1 8 E/F Program in the late 1990 's, when <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> was discovered {{in the heart of the}} maneuver envelope for the pre-production aircraft. While the F/A- 1 8 E/F problem was subsequently corrected by a leading-edge flap scheduling change and the addition of a porous door to the wing fold fairing, the AWS Program was initiated as a national response to the lack of technology readiness available at the time of the F/A- 18 E/F Development Program. The AWS Program objectives were to define causal factors for the F/A- 18 E/F experience, to gain insights into the flow physics associated with <b>wing</b> <b>drop,</b> and to develop methods and analytical tools so that future programs could identify this type of problem before going to flight test.

40|$|Three rocket-propelled buffet-research {{models have}} been flight tested to {{determine}} the buffeting characteristics of a swept-wing- airplane configuration with the horizontal tail operating near the wing wake. The models consisted of parabolic bodies having 45 deg sweptback wings of aspect ratio 3. 56, at aspect ratio of 0. 3, NACA 64 A 007 airfoil sections, and tail surfaces of geometry and section identical to the wings. Two tests were conducted with the horizontal tail located in the wing chord plane with fixed incidence angles of - 1. 5 deg on one model and 0 deg on the other model. The third test was conducted with no horizontal tail. Results of these tests are presented as incremental accelerations in the body due to buffeting, trim angles of attack, trim normal- and side-force coefficients, wing-tip helix angles, static-directional-stability derivatives, and drag coefficients plotted against Mach number. These data indicate that mild low-lift buffeting was experienced by all models over a range of Mach number from approximately 0. 7 to 1. 4. It is further indicated that this buffeting was probably induced by wing-body interference and was amplified at transonic speeds by the horizontal tail operating in the wing wake. A longitudinal trim change was encountered by the tail-on models at transonic speeds, but no large changes in side force and no <b>wing</b> <b>dropping</b> were indicated...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] Control {{effectiveness}} tests, {{using the}} ground-launched rocket-boosted model technique, {{have been made}} on rectangular wings of aspect ratio 4, EC. 1250 section, and fitted with a 25 per cent chord concave control flap. Tests were done from M= 0. 73 to M = 1 - 5, and at R = 3. 5 × 106 and 7 × 106 at M=I. There is a sudden and large reversal in control effectiveness at M = 0. 9, but the measured effectiveness below M = 0. 8 and above M = 1. 1 is in good agreement with theory. These tests confirm and extend to higher Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers previous tunnel tests on the same section, which are reported in R. & M. 2436. 1. Intro&~ction. [...] On a number of aircraft the pursuit of high Mach numbers has been halted by more or less sudden and uncontrollable <b>wing</b> <b>dropping.</b> Wind-tunnel tests by Shaw on an EC. 1250 section with 25 per cent concave control (R. & M. 24361) have suggested a possible explanation in sudden changes in the flow pattern and associated pressure distributions in the neighbourhood of a deflected control. The tests were done at a Reynolds number of about 2 × 106, and the highest Mach number reached was 0. 88. Qualitatively similar results have also been obtained by G 6 thert (Ref. 2) at R = 7 × 106, to a maximum also of about M = 0. 88. The development of the Royal Aircraft Establishment ground-launched rocket-boosted model technique 3 offers a convenient method of confirming Shaw's results and also of extending them t...|$|E

Background {{to the establishment of}} the AWS program is given as well as program objectives. In order to understand the fundamental flow mechanisms that caused the undesirable motions for a pre-production version of the F/A- 18 E, steady and unsteady flow field details were gathered from dedicated transonic wind-tunnel testing and computational studies. The AWS program has also adapted a free-to- roll (FTR) wind-tunnel testing technique traditionally used for low-speed studies of lateral dynamic stability to the transonic flow regime. This FTR capability was demonstrated first in a proof-of-concept study and then applied to an assessment of four different aircraft configurations. Figures of merit for static testing and for FTR testing have been evaluated for two configurations that demonstrated <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> susceptibility during full-scale flight conditions (the pre-production F/A-l 8 E and the AV- 8 B at the extremes of its flight envelope) and two configurations that do not exhibit <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> (the F/A-l 8 C and the F-l 6 C). Design insights have been obtained from aerodynamic computational studies of the four aircraft configurations and from computations quantifying the impact of the various geometric wing differences between the F/A- 18 C and the F/A-l 8 E wings. Finally, the AWS program provides guidance for assessing, in the simulator, the impact of experimentally determined lateral activity on flight characteristics before going to flight...|$|R

50|$|When {{suffering}} from white muscardine, an insect larva may become inactive and stop eating. The elasticity of its cuticle is lost {{and it may}} experience vomiting and diarrhea. As it dies it hardens. The fungus leaves the body of its host covered in powdery white conidia. The fungal layer is tough due to oxalate crystals, and this slows the decay of the body.

50|$|Wingtip stall is {{unlikely}} to occur symmetrically, especially if the aircraft is maneuvering.

Also, roll control may be reduced if the airflow over the ailerons is disrupted by the stall, reducing their effectiveness.|$|R
