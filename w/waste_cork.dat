These granules have a density of about 300 kg/m³, lower than most lightweight aggregates used for making lightweight concrete. Cork granules do not significantly influence cement hydration, but cork dust may. Cork cement composites have several advantages over standard concrete, such as lower thermal conductivities, lower densities and good energy absorption characteristics.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to cork the first idea, the natural cork stopper which protects the best wines in the world, still remains the best known application. History shows that in 3000 BC cork was already being used in regions {{as far away as}} China, Egypt, Babylon and Persia, in {{applications}} designed for fishing, in burial artifacts, in decorative items and also in containers to store food. Despite this history, today there is constant research, development and exploitation of new applications for this noble material and its derivatives before and after production. In this article, a review of the research developed around the use of <b>waste</b> <b>cork</b> materials for the production of activated carbons used for adsorption in both gas and liquid phases is presented. The results shown by some of the samples show the possibility of producing carbon adsorbents with a set of characteristics, not only structural but also surface chemistry, which are very interesting and comparable to those of commercial carbons, and therefore capable of application in real systems. In the gas phase there is the possibility of adsorption and separation of gases such as N 2, O 2, CH 4, CO 2 and volatile organic compounds, while in the liquid phase the removal of phenolic compounds and pharmaceutical compounds present interesting results. Another avenue relates to the production of composites and monoliths from activated carbons or even from recycled cork aglomerates...|$|E
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{possibility}} of using cork wastes form cork processing for energy production. In cork processing operations an important waste is produced, cork powder, the main waste of the cork industry, which is estimated to reach over 30000 tons/year. There are various types of cork powders with higher calorific values ranging from 4, 000 - 7, 000 Kcal/kg. This powder is commonly burned to produce steam or heat used in the factories themselves, given the high energy content of this material. As an example, a cork company of a large industrial group that produces cork products for construction meets 60 % of its energy needs using <b>waste</b> <b>cork.</b> Cork boiling wastewater (CBW) is an aqueous and complex effluent of the cork industry which is produced during the boiling of the cork planks. CBW contains organic materials such as phenolic. This boiling wastewater has no utility, being a serious environmental hazard. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for the treatment of organic effluents and for the simultaneous recovery of its energetic potential through methane production. Its application to cork effluents was studied. An anaerobic assay was conducted. The resultant methane potentials were 0. 126 - 0. 142 m 3 CH 4 kg- 1 COD. The calculated total volume of CBW produced yearly in Portugal is 30 374 m 3. As 1 m 3 of CBW (6, 5 COD kg m- 3) in cogeneration can produce in average 1, 72 kWh of electric energy and 3, 73 kWh of thermal energy, the total CBW volume produced in Portugal in one year corresponds to a total energy value of 165 400 kWh...|$|E
40|$|Cork powder, {{the major}} <b>waste</b> from <b>cork</b> {{processing}} industries, is generated from grinding, cutting and finishing operations throughout the industrial cork process. Cork powder {{has been used}} mainly as fuel in <b>cork</b> industries. <b>Cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash is usually landfilled but if efficiently used in cement based construction materials it could contribute to sustainability. Strength and durability testing was undergone on mortar with 10 and 20 % cement replacement with <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash. Although strength is acceptable for 10 % cement replacement with cork ash (5 % loss at 90 days, compared to control), most durability properties (tested up to 6 months according to test type) reduced performance probably due to a broader pore structure caused by coarse particles in the ash which tested non pozzolanic. Moreover, <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash does not present the necessary requirements in terms of chemical properties considering several standards. Present work has revealed that this <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> cannot {{be used as a}} pozzolan or as a filler in cement based materials. In fact it is known that chemical composition of biomass ash is highly variable due to moisture variations, ash yield and different genetic types of inorganic matter in biomass and therefore it is important to pinpoint which types of biomass waste are adequate or not to use as cement replacement in construction...|$|R
40|$|The cork {{industry}} {{presents itself}} {{as one of}} the most entrepreneurial in the Portuguese industrial sector, contributing significantly to the increase of exports. However, it’s an industry in which the use of raw materials is maximised leaving a large volume of <b>waste.</b> The <b>cork</b> industry has tried to take advantage of these residues, mainly through direct energy recovery, despite the technical and safety difficulties presented by the use of such low density material, which complicates and hinders its transportation for industrial uses outside the area in which it is produced. The densification process opens new doors for such use and also for its storage, because it produces better results when compared with other more common products, such as wood sawdust or even forest and agricultural <b>waste.</b> Thus, <b>cork</b> pellets emerge as a safer and more easily transportable alternative for energy recovery from cork dust and other granulated types of <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> which offer the prospects for wider use. The results demonstrate that cork pellets have higher calorific value when compared with other biomass pellets; typically, approximately 20 MJ/kg with 3 % volume of ashes, which is equivalent to that obtained from the combustion of pellets produced from combined forest and agricultural waste with a bulk density of 750 kg/m 3, which offers real advantages in terms of logistics...|$|R
40|$|Two {{vegetable}} <b>wastes,</b> <b>cork</b> {{bark and}} grape stalks, were investigated {{for the removal}} of methylene blue from aqueous solution. The effects of contact time, dye concentration, pH, and temperature on sorption were studied relative to adsorption on a commercially-activated carbon. The highest adsorption yield was obtained within the pH range 5 to 10 for grape stalks and 7 to 10 for cork bark. The sorption kinetics of dye onto activated carbon and grape stalks was very fast. Kinetics data were fitted to the pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, and the values of the pseudo-second-order initial rate constants were found to be 1. 69 mg g- 1 min- 1 for activated carbon, 2. 24 mg g- 1 min- 1 for grape stalks, and 0. 90 mg g- 1 min- 1 for cork bark. Langmuir maximum sorption capacities for activated carbon, grape stalks, and cork bark for methylene blue estimated by the Orthogonal Distance Regression method (ODR) were 157. 5 mg g- 1, 105. 6 mg g- 1, and 30. 52 mg g- 1, respectively. FTIR spectra indicated that carboxylic groups and lignin {{play a significant role in}} the sorption of methylene blue. Electrostatic forces, n-p interactions, cation-p, and p-p stacking interactions contribute to methylene blue sorption onto grape stalks and cork bark.

In this work, an analysis of pelletizing of granulometric separation powder, {{which is one of the}} major <b>wastes</b> in <b>cork</b> industries and which presents suitable properties (as an raw material) for its thermal use, is studied. However, its characteristic heterogeneity, along with its low bulk density (which makes its storage and transportation difficult) are restrictive factors for its energy use. Therefore, its densified form is a real alternative in order to make the product uniform and guarantee its proper use in boiler systems. Thus, the cork pellets (from granulometric separation powder) in the study met, except for ash content specification, the specifications in standard European Norm EN-Plus (B) for its application as fuel for domestic use...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic voltammetry is {{proposed}} {{for evaluating the}} ability of <b>cork</b> <b>wastes</b> to remove Mn(II) ions by sorption from waters {{to be used for}} public supply. As the first stage, the concentration of several naturally occurring cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+ and Na+) were analyzed in the acid washings that were performed to remove them from the cork. The obtained results were then related to the total concentrations of cations released, as measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy of solutions made by dissolving ashed samples. Cyclic voltammetry {{is proposed}} to measure the manganese concentration in the uptake solutions because it allows the metal oxidation state to be controlled, and was determined to be suitable for use with standard addition methods.

40|$|Cork oak {{ecosystems}} play a {{very important}} environmental and socio-economic role in the Mediterranean basin. Their maintenance relies highly on the cork industry, which in turn, is dependent on these ecosystems. Despite the positive impacts of the cork industry, this is an energy-intensive sector, with a strong need for process heat. Therefore, a careful management of heat consumption is important to minimize its impacts. Being Portugal the world leader in the cork industry, this paper characterizes the Portuguese cork industry and gathers information on the production processes of cork products, with special focus on the generation of residues, heat consuming processes, heat production technologies and energy sources. The study relies on a compilation of data from several sources: statistic offices, industrial companies and associations and scientific literature. Cork powder is the main <b>waste</b> of the <b>cork</b> industry.

40|$|Solid waste {{forecast}} volumes to {{be generated}} or received;at Westinghouse Hanford Company`s Solid Waste program {{over the life}} cycle of the site are described in this report. Previous forecast summary reports have covered only a 30 -year period; however, the life-cycle approach was adopted for this FY 1996 report to ensure consistency with waste volumes reported in the 1996 Multi-Year Program Plans (MYPP). The volume data were collected on a life-cycle basis from onsite and offsite waste generators who currently ship or plan to ship solid waste to the Solid Waste program. The volumes described in detail are low-level mixed waste (LLMW) and transuranic/transuranic-mixed (TRU(M)) waste. The volumes reported in this document represent the external volume of the containers selected to ship the waste. Summary level information pertaining to low-level waste (LLW) is described in Appendix B. Hazardous waste volumes are also provided in Appendices E and F but are not described in detail since they will be managed by a commercial facility. Emphasis is placed on LLMW and TRU(M) waste because it will require processing and storage at Hanford Solid Waste`s Central <b>Waste</b> Complex (<b>CORK)</b> prior to final disposal. The LLW will generally be sent directly to disposal. The total baselines volume of LLMW and TRU(M) waste forecast to be received by the Solid Waste program (until 2070) is approximately 100, 900 cubic meters. This total waste volume is composed of the following waste categories: 077, 080 cubic meters of LLMW; 23, 180 cubic meters of TRU(M); 640 cubic meters of greater-than-class III LLMW.

40|$|Natural {{cork stopper}} {{manufacturing}} produces {{a significant amount}} of <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> which is granulated and combined with synthetic glues for use {{in a wide range of}} applications. There is a high demand for using biosourced polymers in these composite materials. In this study, xanthan gum (XG) and chitosan (CS) were investigated as possible natural binders for cork. Xanthan gum was oxidized at two different aldehyde contents as a strategy to improve its water resistance. This modification was studied in detail by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and the degree of oxidation was determined by the hydroxylamine hydrochloride titration method. The performance of the adhesives was studied by tensile tests and total soluble matter (TSM) determinations. Xanthan gum showed no water resistance, contrary to oxidized xanthan gum and chitosan. It is hypothesized that the good performance of oxidized xanthan gum is due to the reaction of aldehyde groups—formed in the oxidation process—with hydroxyl groups on the cork surface during the high temperature drying. Combining oxidized xanthan gum with chitosan did not yield significant improvements...|$|R

In this work we show {{the possibility of}} using these activated carbons for the adsorption of phenolic compounds from the aqueous phase. The materials present a different response to the adsorptives used (p-nitrophenol, p-chlorophenol, p-cresol and phenol), {{depending on the type of}} activation and the parameters (burn-off, absolute concentration) used in each case. All the samples were capable of retaining the contaminants, with the best result being reached by the sample with higher burnoff and the worst with the carbonised, while intermediate values were reached with the remaining samples. The experimental isotherms were analysed with two and three parameters equations (Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin–Radushkevich–Kaganer and Redlich–Peterson). The results obtained from the application of the equations are similar in some aspects, but the degree of confidence is quite different. The best fit was achieved with the Redlich–Peterson equation, which can be explained by the fact that this has three adjustable parameters. However, overall the Freundlich and DRK equations appear to be more useful and provide parameters which can be correlated with the structural characteristics of the solids obtained from N 2 adsorption measurements...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{patented}} {{process for the}} treatment and reprocessing of waste and effluents from olive oil and cork industries (such as two-phase olive husks cork powder), new research {{has been carried out}} incorporating other industrial waste. In previous research, using only olive oil and <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> biomass pellets were obtained having high calorific values (20. 6 MJ/kg and 22. 2 MJ/kg), low moisture (8. 9 %) and relatively a low ash percentage (3. 9 %). Several new formulations and their relevance to the calorific value were now tested using other waste or by-products. The potential inclusion of olive leaves from the olive oil industry, grape husks and grape seeds from the winery industry and chestnut shells (outer shell and inner skin) from the chestnut industry has been analysed. This process will contribute to solving environmental problems resulting from the discharge of those waste and effluents and to create a viable and profitable alternative to their storage and/or deposition in landfill. The increase of other biomass sources for these types of process is extremely important from an environmental and economic management point of view. This research shows that the use of different types of raw materials as biomass sources (giving different pellets formulations) results in a different final product with different physical and chemical characteristics that may improve its quality...|$|R

Biodegradation of contaminated cork using filamentous fungi {{could be a good}} alternative for detoxifying cork to facilitate its final processing. For this purpose, the degradation {{efficiency of}} anthracene by three ligninolytic white-rot fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Irpex lacteus and Pleurotus ostreatus) and three non-ligninolytic fungi which are found in the cork itself (Aspergillus Niger, Penicillium simplicissimum and Mucor racemosus) are compared. Anthracene degradation by all fungi was examined in solid-phase cultures after 0, 16, 30 and 61 days. The degradation products of anthracene by P. simplicissimum and I. lacteus were also identified by GC-MS and a metabolic pathway was proposed for P. simplicissimum. Results show that all the fungi tested degraded anthracene. After 61 days of incubation, approximately 86 %, 40 %, and 38 % of the initial concentration of anthracene (i. e., 100 μM) was degraded by P. simplicissimum, P. chrysosporium and I. lacteus, respectively. The rest of the fungi degraded anthracene to a lesser extent (< 30 %). As a final remark, the results obtained in this study indicate that P. simplicissimum, a non-ligninolytic fungi characteristic of cork itself, could be used as an efficient degrader of PAH-contaminated corkThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación as part of the project CTM 2009 - 07162 and CTM 2010 - 1518...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the potencial of <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> to remove Cu (II) and Cr (VI) from aqueous {{solutions}} has been studied. Raw cork and biochar prepared by pyrolysis of the cork, were used. Kinetic and equilibrium batch sorption experiments were performed {{in order to}} compare the sorption efficiency of each material. Adsorption isotherms were expressed by Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium models. Moreover the batch kinetic experiments were fitted to the commonly pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations. The {{results showed that the}} metal removal using raw cork as the sorbent is pH-dependent with the uptake of 61. 5 % for chromium at pH 3 and 55. 6 % for copper at pH 6. Two types of cork size (0. 5 mm and 2 mm particle size) showed the same adsorption potential. Biochar with high specific surface area (300 m 2 g- 1) can be easily prepared from the raw cork. The raw cork results show that pseudo-second-order describe better kinetic data for both metals. According to kinetic data the adsorption of chromium using biochar is the best option for removing this metal from water. Biochar is able to sorb copper and chromium. The Langmuir model is not able to fit the experimental values for Cr, nevertheless is able to fit Cu, where the maximum adsorption was 13. 4 mg kg- 1.

40|$|Cork is {{the bark}} of the tree Quercus suber L. which ï¬ nds use in diverse applications. However, a signiï¬ cant {{percentage}} is still rejected and burned for energy production, despite containing valuable molecules for materials processing and with important biological activities. Herein, the optimization of the extraction process to obtain these molecules, using mild solvents and conditions, is described within a bioreï¬ nery perspective. The extracts were obtained by direct contact solvent extractions with water, ethanol and its mixtures for different time and temperatures, and evaluated for chemical composition, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant properties [by DPPH radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays]. The {{results showed that the}} extraction process is accelerated and higher yields are achieved with the increase in temperature without chemical degradation or compromising the antioxidant capacity. For all solvents, at reï¬ ux temperature, more than 90 % of the extractable material is obtained within 6 h (80 % within 1 h). The highest TPC and antioxidant capacity are observed for the extracts obtained with mixtures of water and ethanol of similar volumes. The antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays was found to be proportional to the extract TPC, while ORAC is favored for higherÂ percentages of ethanol on the extracting solvent. The main constituents of these extracts are the ellagitannins, vescalagin, castalagin and b-O-ethylvescalagin, along with other phenolic acids (mainly ellagic and gallic acids) and various ï¬ avonols. The extracts stability was monitored up to 1 year of storage with neither reduction in the antioxidant capacity nor chemical degradation. These results show that extracts with strong antioxidant potential and high content of bioactive molecules can be obtained from the processing of <b>waste</b> streams. <b>Cork</b> is a sustainable forest product and the development of new ï¬ elds of application contributes toward a zero waste cycle for a complete material bioreï¬ nery.

40|$|Novel {{processes}} for sterilization and deodorization of cork stoppers and cork barks {{have been developed}} and evaluated. Cork sterilization targets to microbial load reduction, either for bacteria or yeasts-moulds, while the reduction of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -Trichloroanisole (2, 4, 6 -TCA) of cork is achieved via their deodorization. The determination of microbial load and rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA οf cork {{was carried out by}} appropriate developed and evaluated analytical techniques, while the corks were subjected to artificial microbial or chemical contamination in many cases. The application of the plain ozonation process (ozone dosage= 1500 g?min/m 3) proved to be particularly efficient on microbial load removal of cork barks (98 %) and their 7 day preservation, without causing any remarkable degradation of cork quality characteristics. At once, three times higher ozone dosage (4500 g?min/m 3) resulted to a deodorization degree varied from 45 to 82 % and this variation is probably due to the local distribution of 2, 4, 6 -TCA in cork and to the restricted ozone access in cork internal structure. Despite the application of plain and pulsed steam processes, under the experimental conditions, resulted to lower sterilization efficacy of barks (76 %), showed comparable deodorization percentages (75 - 85 %) accompanied with lower remaining values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA. The steam pulsed process (SPP) was selected as the optimum process based on techno economical criteria, for the treatment of artificially contaminated cork stoppers, because during its application, a 99 % sterilization degree and a comparable deodorization efficacy was achieved, resulted to a rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA sufficiently lower to the acceptable quality limit of 5 ng/L. Ozone usage, showed once more its excellent sterilizing action, but its contribution to cork stopper deodorization seemed to be negligible. Consequently, taking into account the high cost required for ozone production, its use wasn’t desirable. During a more detailed insight of the optimum process SPP, naturally contaminated cork stoppers were tested and sporadic resistance phenomena to deodorization were observed probably due to thermal collapsing of cork cells and 2, 4, 6 -TCA content release from these cells. Based on a statistical analysis using Gamma distribution was demonstrated that SPP treatment of naturally contaminated cork stoppers contributed to an increase of the possibility to find an untainted cork stopper from a bale from 0, 54 to 0, 74. In the sequel, an appropriate mathematical model describing the deodorization of artificially and naturally contaminated cork stoppers was constructed and its critical parameters were determined by obtained experimental data simulation In the second part, the deodorization of cork stoppers through the liquid or gas phase, using commercially available adsorbents was studied. The majority of the tested materials showed significant adsorption capacity against 2, 4, 6 -TCA and Tygon was chosen for further study. The simultaneous presence of Tygon in cork aqueous extracts, during a time period of 16 h, conduced to values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 - TCA of cork stoppers significant lower than the limit of 5 ng/L, delimiting 97 % deodorization, while the 20 day residence of Tygon with artificially contaminated cork stoppers in an enclosed gas atmosphere was proved sufficient in order to achieve a 95 % deodorization degree. The estimated operational cost of the deodorization process with Tygon was 200 times lower than the corresponding cost of SPP. Finally, 2, 4, 6 -TCA management as a <b>waste</b> amount during <b>cork</b> deodorization processes in liquid or gas phase, was included the usage of oxidizing agents, as ozone and the photocatalytic degradation on titania film. The latter process resulted to faster and more efficient 2, 4, 6 -TCA reduction in gas phase (99 %), providing a potential solution. ...|$|R
