What will ensue? Hearing him attacked, my Cousin Angela's womanly heart will be as sick as mud. The maternal tigress in her will awake. No matter what differences they may have had, she will remember only that he is the man she loves, and will leap to his defence. And from that to falling into his arms and burying the dead past will be but a step. How do you react to that?" ...|$|E

50|$|The zoo of Lubumbashi {{is one of}} {{the most}} visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is {{considered}} the nicest zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo. AZLU is keeping the zoo “for education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,” as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, <b>wart</b> <b>hogs,</b> crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.|$|R

The endangered pygmy hippopotamus has territories around the islands on the Moa River and is {{widespread in the}} Gola Forest area.

40|$|Piglets {{appear to}} lack brown adipose tissue, a {{specific}} type of fat that is essential for nonshivering thermogenesis in mammals, and they rely on shivering as the main mechanism for thermoregulation. Here we provide a genetic explanation for the poor thermoregulation in pigs as we demonstrate that the gene for uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) was disrupted in the pig lineage. UCP 1 is exclusively expressed in brown adipose tissue and plays a crucial role for thermogenesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. We used long-range PCR and genome walking to determine the complete genome sequence of pig UCP 1. An alignment with human UCP 1 revealed that exons 3 to 5 were eliminated by a deletion in the pig sequence. The presence of this deletion was confirmed in all tested domestic pigs, as well as in European wild boars, Bornean bearded pigs, <b>wart</b> <b>hogs,</b> and red river hogs. Three additional disrupting mutations were detected in the remaining exons. Furthermore, the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions was clearly elevated in the pig sequence compared with the corresponding sequences in humans, cattle, and mice, and we used this increased rate to estimate that UCP 1 was disrupted about 20 million years ago.

5000|$|Ivory is a hard, white {{material}} from the tusks (traditionally elephant's) and teeth of animals, {{that can be used}} in art or manufacturing. It consists mainly of dentine (inorganic formula Ca10(PO4)6(CO3)·H2O)), one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks. The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin. The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, [...] "ivory" [...] can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. It has been valued since ancient times for making a range of items, from ivory carvings to false teeth, fans, dominoes and joint tubes. Elephant ivory is the most important source, but ivory from mammoth, walrus, hippopotamus, sperm whale, killer whale, narwhal and <b>wart</b> <b>hog</b> are used as well. [...] Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 535 sera from eight species of {{wildlife}} {{were collected from}} different game areas in Tanzania between 1987 and 1989. These sera were tested for antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease, bovine herpes virus types 1 and 2, lumpy skin disease, bovine viral diarrhoea, Akabane, bovine ephemeral fever, bluetongue, enzootic bovine leucosis, African horse sickness and African swine fever viruses and Brucella abortus based on the expected species susceptibility. Sera from buffalo Syncerus caffer, wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and topi Damaliscus korrigum contained antibodies against {{the majority of the}} pathogens tested. Antibodies to fewer pathogens were detected in sera from the other species. No antibodies to lumpy skin disease virus were detected in any of the sera examined. African horse sickness antibodies were detected in sera from Zebra and African swine fever antibodies were detected in <b>wart</b> <b>hog.</b> The occurrence of antibodies to these agents suggests that wild species act as reservoirs of infection for some of these pathogens. However, until the susceptibility of individual species is proven by isolation of the aetiological agents their role must remain speculative...|$|E
40|$|Writers from Central African Republic are {{virtually}} unknown abroad. This study {{focuses on the}} place and functions of the folktale in Goyemide’s two novels published in France in 1984 and 1985, Le silence de la forêt and Le Dernier survivant de la caravane. In both novels, folktales clearly belong to oral literature. Le dernier survivant is divided into four chapters, each offering an unusual mix of literary genres: Narratives, speeches, songs, chants, legends and folktales. Folktales are used as thread, an umbilical cord linking individuals to their past: the two folktales inserted into the first novel help the main protagonist find the meaning of life, {{and those of the}} dernier survivant reinforce the villagers’ ancestral ties of the villagers. The five folktales about the tortoise and gorilla, the wren, the toad and the lizard, are directly inspired by age-long traditions and offer words of wisdom. Those folktales are there as another way of telling life experiences; they have symbolic and prophetic functions, proclaiming the victory of the underdog and the slaves’ ultimate liberation. At the very moment the story-teller leaves the scene, readers remember his first prophetic words: Africans will eventually free themselves from the colonial yoke, the same way Tortoise got rid of the <b>wart</b> <b>hog,</b> the same way the wren signals the end of the storm, the same way African slaves ran away from the Tuareg slave masters...|$|E
