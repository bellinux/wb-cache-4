5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply.

5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> equator and on a passive margin.

An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E

5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E

The men of the 1st Battalion, Charlie Company, Malay Regiment, led by Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi fought bravely to the last. Many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The guns from Labrador assisted the Malay Regiment in their 48-hour struggle against the Japanese by firing high-explosive shells at enemy troops. However, with Japanese reinforcements, the Malay Regiment were finally surrounded and massacred. Three lucky ones, together with Lieutenant Abbas Abdul-Manan managed to escape and later rejoined 30 surviving soldiers of a British battalion in the nearby area.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953.

5|$|Learning from {{a runner}} that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks. Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas {{resolved}} {{to stay at}} the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end <b>was</b> <b>near,</b> <b>the</b> Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> action, so he led it in that direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana <b>was</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
