25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable tau neutrino.|$|E

He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving {{an example of how}} he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach.

[...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, {{and you have a}} picture of Horror Planet." [...] He added his opinion that brutal violence does not guarantee narrative suspense, punning on the name Run Run Shaw in his downbeat conclusion that [...] "Horror Planet is a film to run, run away from—fast." ...|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{noted that}} the ending was {{genuinely}} unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving [...] "from a twee period piece to <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's [...] "secret weapon", [...] "very fitting", [...] "suitably macabre", and [...] "fantastically nasty". For Hughes, it [...] "was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved". Two reviews in The Times, however—one unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd—were more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before the end, as [...] "the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of [...] "shocking {{for the sake of}} shocking", he argued that the episode's [...] "half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed". In i, an unsigned review of [...] "The Bill"—the second episode of the third series—suggested that viewers may have been put off the programme by the [...] "rather nasty final couple of minutes" [...] of [...] "The Devil of Christmas".|$|E

2500|$|The Michigan Stadium crowd, sensing a major upset, began {{screaming}} and chanting. Michigan {{tried to run}} down the clock, but Ohio State stalled with timeouts and got the ball back after a Wolverine punt. With 29 seconds left, Maciejowski fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Cecil Pryor. The Buckeyes had committed an unheard-of seven turnovers on the day, six interceptions and a fumble. Moorhead took a knee as the crowd counted down the final seconds, then rushed the field in ecstasy.

[...] Coleman went on, [...] "you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies" [...] and [...] "the record reflects that you didn't get it or you didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be done until way after it should have been done." [...] Brown responded combatively, [...] "well, Senator, that's very {{easy for you to say}} sitting behind that dais and not being there in the middle of that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying to deal with those structural dysfunctionalities" [...] and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman's charges to a [...] "drive-by shooting." [...] Brown had recently stated that he notified Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.|$|E

2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E
