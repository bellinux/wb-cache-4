The <b>w-index</b> {{can be defined as}} follows: If w of a researcher's papers have at least 10 w citations each and the other papers have fewer than 10 (w+ 1) citations, his/her <b>w-index</b> is w. It is a significant improvement of the h-index. Comment: 7 pages, 3 tables, small changes from v...|$|E

40|$|We used {{segregation}} analysis {{to investigate the}} genetic basis of variation in dystopia canthorum, {{one of the key}} diagnostic features of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS 1). We sought to determine whether the <b>W-index,</b> a quantitative measure of this craniofacial feature, is influenced primarily either by allelic variation in the PAX 3 disease gene or other major loci, by polygenic background effects, or by all of these potential sources of genetic variation. We studied both WS 1 -affected individuals and their WS 1 -unaffected relatives. After adjustment of the <b>W-index</b> for WS 1 disease status, segregation analyses by the regression approach indicated major-locus control of this variation, although residual parent-offspring and sib-sib correlations are consistent with additional (possibly polygenic) effects. Separate analyses of WS 1 -affected and WS 1 -unaffected individuals suggest that epistatic interactions between disease alleles at the PAX 3 WS 1 locus and a second major locus influence variation in dystopia canthorum. Our approach should be applicable for assessing the genetic architecture of variation associated with other genetic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{from the}} {{existing}} literature on risk and inequality measurement, we implement the notion of ‘‘certainty equivalent citation’’ in order (i) to generalize most of the h-type citation indexes (h-, g-, ~g; t-, f-, <b>w-index),</b> and (ii) to highlight {{the centrality of the}} decision-maker’s preferences on distributive aspects (concentration aversion) for the ranking of citation profiles. In order to highlight the sensitivity of citation orderings with respect to concentration aversion, an application to both simulated and real citation profiles is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{planetary}} {{ionospheric storm}} index, Wp, is deduced from the numerical global ionospheric GPS-IONEX {{maps of the}} vertical total electron content, TEC, {{for more than half}} a solar cycle, 1999 &ndash; 2008. The TEC values are extracted from the 600 grid points of the map at latitudes 60 &deg; N to 60 &deg; S with a step of 5 &deg; and longitudes 0 &deg; to 345 &deg; E with a step of 15 &deg; providing the data for 00 : 00 to 23 : 00 h of local time. The local effects of the solar radiant energy are filtered out by normalizing of the TEC in terms of the solar zenith angle &chi; at a particular time and the local noon value &chi; 0 . The degree of perturbation, DTEC, is computed as log of TEC relative to quiet reference median for 27 days prior to the day of observation. The <b>W-index</b> map is generated by segmentation of DTEC with the relevant thresholds specified earlier for foF 2 so that 1 or &minus; 1 stands for the quiet state, 2 or &minus; 2 for the moderate disturbance, 3 or &minus; 3 for the moderate ionospheric storm, and 4 or &minus; 4 for intense ionospheric storm at each grid point of the map. The planetary ionospheric storm Wp index is obtained from the <b>W-index</b> map as a latitudinal average of the distance between maximum positive and minimum negative <b>W-index</b> weighted by the latitude/longitude extent of the extreme values on the map. The threshold Wp exceeding 4. 0 index units and the peak value Wpmax&ge; 6. 0 specify the duration and the power of the planetary ionosphere-plasmasphere storm. It is shown that the occurrence of the Wp storms is growing with the phase of the solar cycle being twice as much as the number of the magnetospheric storms with Dst&le;&minus; 100 nT and Ap&ge; 100 nT...|$|E
40|$|The Ionospheric Weather Assessment and Forecast (IWAF) {{system is}} a {{computer}} software package designed to assess and predict the world-wide representation of 3 -D electron density profiles from the Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). The unique system products include daily-hourly numerical global maps of the F 2 layer critical frequency (foF 2) and the peak height (hmF 2) generated with the International Reference Ionosphere extended to the plasmasphere, IRI-Plas, upgraded by importing the daily-hourly GIM-TEC as a new model driving parameter. Since GIM-TEC maps are provided with 1 - or 2 -days latency, the global maps forecast for 1 day and 2 days ahead are derived using an harmonic analysis applied to the temporal changes of TEC, foF 2 and hmF 2 at 5112 grid points of a map encapsulated in IONEX format (- 87. 5 °: 2. 5 °: 87. 5 °N in latitude, - 180 °: 5 °: 180 °E in longitude). The system provides online the ionospheric disturbance warnings in the global <b>W-index</b> map establishing categories of the ionospheric weather from the quiet state (W=± 1) to intense storm (W=± 4) according to the thresholds set for instant TEC perturbations regarding quiet reference median for the preceding 7 days. The accuracy of IWAF system predictions of TEC, foF 2 and hmF 2 maps is superior to the standard persistence model with prediction equal {{to the most recent}} ‘true’ map. The paper presents outcomes of the new service expressed by the global ionospheric foF 2, hmF 2 and <b>W-index</b> maps demonstrating the process of origin and propagation of positive and negative ionosphere disturbances in space and time and their forecast under different scenarios.

40|$|A time {{sequence}} is a discrete sequence of vahtes, e. g. tem-perature measurements, varying over time. Conventional indexes for time sequences {{are built on}} the time domain and cannot derd with inverse queries on a time sequence (i. e. computing the times when the values satis ~ some condi-tions). To process an inverse query the entire time sequence has to be scanned. This paper presents a dynamic indexing technique on the vahte domain for large time sequences which can be implemented using regular ordered indexing techniques (e. g. B-trees). Our index (termed ZP-irtdex) dra-matically improves the query processing time of inverse queries compared to linear scanning. For periodic time sequences that have a limited range and precision on their value domain (most time sequences have this property), the <b>W-index</b> has an upper bound for insertion time and search time. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates new fibre {{technologies}} and their application in nonlinear optical systems, designed mainly for telecommunications. The thesis includes {{a study of}} two different directions in achieving a high nonlinearity in a fibre system, namely holey fibres filled with nonlinear liquids and soft glass, small core microstructured fibres. The challenges arising from the development of liquid-filled structures have made soft glass microstructured fibres the technology of choice for the realisation of highly nonlinear systems Amongst the various soft glasses, commercially available lead-silicate glasses are identified as the material {{for the development of}} highly nonlinear fibres. Small-core, leadsilicate fibres with different designs are considered within this thesis. A solid core holey fibre design as well as two all-solid designs, a multi-ring cladding and a simpler <b>W-index</b> profile, are characterised. The measurements confirm the advantages of the all-solid designs over the holey structures and reveal the possibility to achieve simultaneously a high nonlinear coefficient and a novel dispersion profile in such fibres. Some of the presented fibres are employed in all-optical wavelength conversion schemes based on fourwave-mixing. Numerical simulations and experimental results are combined to study the performance of the fibres and demonstrate their use in wavelength conversion devices. In particular, a lead-silicate <b>W-index</b> profile fibre, showing a high nonlinear coefficient of 820 W− 1 km− 1 with a near zero dispersion profile at telecoms wavelengths, is employed to demonstrate a flat conversion gain in the whole C-band. The same fibre is then employed in FWM-based systems to demonstrate multi-channel wavelength conversion, generation of high repetition rate pulses and all-optical demultiplexing. The experiments presented in this thesis clearly reveal the potential of small-core soft-glass fibres for nonlinear applications. The use of soft glass microstructured fibres in the mid-IR is also investigated. Tellurite holey fibres with different core sizes and hole arrangements are employed in a supercontinuum generation scheme. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{research}} projects funded by various agencies can be evaluated {{by studying the}} research publications generated from those projects and the research publications can be evaluated using impact factors and citation indices. There are several citation indices commonly {{used to assess the}} value/quality of a research publication or the research impact of an author or a journal. Research indices are calculated based on either citation values of research publications of a research scholar or the number of research papers published by a research scholar for a given period. There are many research indices developed by many types of research which include H-index, i 10 -index, G-index, H(2) -index, HG-index, Q 2 -index, AR-index, M-quotient, M-index, <b>W-index,</b> Hw-index, E-index, A-index, R-index, <b>W-index,</b> J-index, etc. Out of these citation based research indices, h-index, G-index and i 10 -index are commonly used in some of the citation databases. Researchers have also studied the problems and limitations associated with these indices. In this paper, we have discussed the most popular research indices presently used which include h-index, G-index, and i- 10 -index along with their advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages. Most of the research indices are calculated based on number of citations a paper receives. The major limitation of this model is that the citations usually increase with an increase in time even after the researcher dies, the citations and hence the indices continue to grow. It is argued that due to various reasons, a research publication may not attract citations initially for some years and after ten to twenty years some papers may attract citations. The best method of identifying the contribution to research is calculating the annual research index for an author by considering the annual research publications. Accordingly, based on annual research index of an author, his average research contribution for five years, or ten years, or twenty years or any desired period can be determined. Here, we have suggested some of the new research indices to be used for calculating research productivity of individuals as well as a team of people in an organization. The paper also contains some of our newly proposed indices including ARP-Index – (Annual Research Publication Index), RC-Index – (Research Continuation Index), RE-Index (Research expansion Index), Project Productivity Index, and Cost Index and the method of calculating these indices along with their advantages and limitations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} hereditary disorder essentially characterised by deafness and pigment disorders of the eyes, {{hair and}} skin. Method: Between October 2010 and December 2011, we identified six patients with WS during an aetiological survey of 582 deaf participants recruited in schools for the deaf and ear, nose and throat outpatient clinics in seven of the ten regions of Cameroon. Two classic characteristics of WS were used as diagnostic criteria: deafness and pigmentation abnormalities (heterochromia iridis, white forelock and depigmented skin patches). In addition, to identify dystopia canthorum, a sign of WS type I, we calculated the <b>W-index.</b> Results: WS comprised 1 % of the whole sample, 7 % of the genetic cases, and 50 % of the genetic syndromic cases. All patients with WS had severe to profound congenital sensorineural and symmetrical hearing loss with flat audiograms. They also had pigment disorders of the eyes and the skin. In the absence of dystopia canthorum, they were all classified as having WS type II. The pedigree was suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance in two cases, and the four others seemed to be de novo cases. Conclusion. The results suggest that WS type II {{is the most common}} syndromic form of hearing loss among Cameroonians. This has implications for retrospective genetic counselling and hearing tests for earlier management in affected families...|$|E
