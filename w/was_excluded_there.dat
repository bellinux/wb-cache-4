40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether hyaluronidase (Hyalase) {{is a useful}} and justified addition to haematoma block for pain relief. METHODS: The study was a randomised double blind trial of 33 consecutive patients attending the {{accident and emergency department}} for manipulation of distal radius fracture under haematoma block. Control patients received 1 % lignocaine; the treatment group received 1 % lignocaine plus 1500 IU hyaluronidase. Manipulation occurred 10 minutes after instituting the block. RESULTS: 16 patients received hyaluronidase, 17 received lignocaine only. One patient with unsuccessful manipulation <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b> <b>There</b> {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups for any of three methods of pain assessment (P > 0. 05, Mann Whitney). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of hyaluronidase does not increase the efficacy of the haematoma block when 10 minutes are allowed to elapse before manipulation, and the increased cost of adding (and risk of allergy) is not justified by any theoretical increased speed of analgesia...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} of body mass index to 5 -year mortality in a cohort of 4317 nonsmoking men and women aged 65 to 100 years. METHODS: Logistic regression {{analyses were conducted to}} predict mortality as a function of baseline body mass index, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and laboratory covariates. RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between body mass index and mortality; death rates were higher for those who weighed the least. Inclusion of covariates had trivial effects on these results. People who had lost 10 % or more of their body weight since age 50 had a relatively high death rate. When that group <b>was</b> <b>excluded,</b> <b>there</b> was no remaining relationship between body mass index and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The association between higher body mass index and mortality often found in middle-aged populations was not observed in this large cohort of older adults. Over-weight {{does not seem to be}} a risk factor for 5 -year mortality in this age group. Rather, the risks associated with significant weight loss should be the primary concern...|$|E
40|$|Brain atrophy {{has been}} used as a marker for disease {{progression}} in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). SIENA, an automated tool for measuring brain volume change, was tested to see whether MRI slice thickness and gap presence affect longitudinal atrophy measures. Isotropic global scan-rescan images were used to simulate 3 mm and 5 mm axial slice thicknesses with 1 and 2 mm gaps, respectively. SIENA remained accurate and precise with increasing slice thickness and gap presence. Furthermore, symmetric pre-registration was crucial for scans with larger slice-thickness and gaps. SIENA was used to observe atrophy in children who have experienced a Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) of the type leading to MS (CIS-MS). Brain atrophy was present within the first three months after a CIS event, and then subsided over the rest of the year.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of psychological therapies for people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature. A comprehensive literature search identified 143 intervention studies. Twenty-two trials were eligible for review, and 14 of these were subsequently included in the meta-analysis. Many studies did not include adequate information about their participants, especially the nature of their IDs; information about masked assessment, and therapy fidelity was also lacking. The meta-analysis yielded an overall moderate between-group effect size, g =. 682, while group-based interventions had a moderate but smaller treatment effect than individual-based interventions.

Methods: A cross-sectional population survey involving a telephone survey technique {{was used to}} identify 1, 222 randomly selected Cantonese-speaking people aged at least 18 years. Standard questions were asked {{on the experience of}} 8 orofacial pain symptoms in the previous month and on treatment-seeking behavior. Results: Orofacial pain symptoms were reported by 41. 6 % of respondents when tooth sensitivity was included and by 24. 2 % when it <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b> <b>There</b> was no gender- or age-related difference in pain prevalence (P >. 010). Tooth sensitivity was the most common symptom (27. 7 %), followed by toothache (12. 5 %), and shooting pain in the face was the least common (1. 1 %). Almost half those with symptoms reported the pain as moderate to severe, and a fifth had frequent pain. Only 20. 3 % with pain symptoms sought professional treatment, and use of self-prescribed medication was very low (12. 4 %). Conclusion: Orofacial pain symptoms appear to affect {{more than a quarter of}} the adult population in Hong Kong, and prevalence estimates were consistent with those in Western countries. A substantial proportion of the pain symptoms were frequent and of moderate to severe intensity, with the potential for significant morbidity. Professional treatment seeking was very low and may be related to specific pain behaviors and effective coping strategies in this ethnic group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Scientific Reports, 5, 8. doi: 10. 1038 /srep 15691 Mutualistic ants can protect their partners from natural enemies in nature. Aenasius bambawalei is an important parasitoid of the the invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis. We hypothesized that mutualism between native ants and mealybugs would favor survival of mealybugs. To test this, we examined effects of tending by the native mutualistic ant Tapinoma melanocephalum on growth of P. solenopsis colonies on Chinese hibiscus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, in a field setting. Ant workers with access to honeydew of mealybugs lived much longer than those provisioned only with water in the laboratory, and number of ant workers foraging increased significantly with growth of mealybug colonies in the field. In later observations, {{there were significant differences}} in densities of mealybugs between ant-tended and -excluded treatments. Survival rate of mealybugs experiencing parasitoid attack was significantly higher on ant-tended plants than on ant-excluded plants. When the parasitoid <b>was</b> <b>excluded,</b> <b>there</b> was no difference in survival rate of mealybugs between ant-tended and -excluded plants.

30|$|We {{calculated}} condensation {{to occur}} much more frequently on the quartz stone surface {{as compared to}} the soil surface (538 vs. 355 h corresponding to 14.0 vs. 9.2 % of the time from May 13 to October 19, 2005). If the influence of precipitation, which may cool down the quartz or soil surface, <b>was</b> <b>excluded,</b> <b>there</b> were still 498 vs. 316 h of condensation conditions. Condensation conditions without rain influence were observed during 50 % of the nights on quartz pebble surfaces, but only 34 % of the nights on soil crust surfaces. This difference is most probably caused by the higher heat transfer rates of quartz stones {{as compared to the}} soil surface, causing the quartz pebbles to cool down more quickly. The condensed water trickles along the quartz stone sides and infiltrates deeper into the soil, as Vogel (1955) observed in an experimental approach. During drying he found that, due to the blocked evaporation, the soil under the stone remained wet for a longer time. This perfectly agrees with our measurements of far higher and also more balanced humidity values under the quartz field as compared to the soil-inhabiting crust. The lower maximum soil moisture may also be caused by a lower pore space of soil below soil-inhabiting crusts as compared to hypolithic crusts. Higher moisture contents under the quartz stones as compared to the surrounding soil were also found by Smith et al. (2000), {{and in the absence of}} rain, Azúa-Bustos et al. (2011) observed humidity values above 90 % in the early morning hours.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the rate of}} recurrence of horizontal laxity or lid malposition and suture-related complications {{associated with the use}} of an absorbable suture in the lateral tarsal strip procedure. DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, consecutive case series. METHODS: A prospective study. SETTING: Institutional. PATIENT POPULATION: One hundred patients with horizontal lid laxity associated with ectropion or entropion. Patients with paralytic ectropion or ocular prostheses were excluded. INTERVENTION: One hundred and five lateral tarsal strip procedures were performed using a 6 - 0 polyglactin suture. These were combined with full-thickness skin grafts (34), internal (55) or external (23) retractor plications, and inverting sutures (4) as required to correct the lid malposition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrence of horizontal laxity or lid malposition and suture related complications were the main outcome measures. Suture related wound infection was diagnosed clinically by the presence of pus associated with wound breakdown. RESULTS: One patient failed to reach 3 -month follow-up and <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b> <b>There</b> was one recurrence of horizontal laxity after a mean follow-up period of 9. 1 months. Four patients developed lateral canthal wound infections, compared with none at the other operative sites. The 95 % confidence intervals for infections in the tarsal strip procedure were 1. 1 % to 9. 6 %, which were significantly greater than zero (P <. 0001), the infection rate for the other procedures. CONCLUSION: A 6 - 0 absorbable suture may be used for the lateral tarsal strip and does not lead to a recurrence of horizontal laxity.

A {{decline in}} the {{abundance}} of this long-lived protogynous hermaphrodite has led to its listing as an endangered species in the Mediterranean, and heightened management concerns regarding its genetic variability and population substructure. To address these concerns, we analysed genetic variation at seven microsatellite and 28 allozyme loci in dusky groupers sampled from seven areas (for microsatellites) and three areas (for allozymes) in the west-central Mediterranean. Levels of genetic variability were higher for microsatellites than for allozymes (mean H-E = 0. 78 and 0. 07, respectively), but similar to those observed in other marine fishes with comparable markers. Both microsatellites and allozymes revealed significant genetic differentiation among all areas analysed with each class of marker, but the magnitude of differentiation revealed by allozymes over three locales (F-ST = 0. 214) was greater than that detected with microsatellites over seven areas, or over the three areas shared with the allozyme analysis (F-ST = 0. 018 and - 0, respectively). A {{large proportion of the}} allozyme differentiation was due to a single locus (ADA*) possibly influenced by selection, but allozyme differentiation over the three areas was still highly significant (F-ST = 0. 06, P < 0. 0001), and the 95 % confidence intervals for allozyme and microsatellite FST did not overlap when this locus <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b> <b>There</b> was no evidence of isolation by distance with either class of markers.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to bring into}} focus certain details which have not been described adequately in textbooks of anatomy. This information is now of considerable significance because of {{its role in the}} genesis and surgical treatment of mitral stenosis. Variations in {{the size and shape of}} the mitral valve are described, with particular reference to the fact that valve commissures, or junctional zones between the leaflets, occur in the normal valve. Measurements of commissures, chordae tendineae and valve leaflets are presented, with a discussion of the significance of some of these measurements. UNTIL recent years, descriptions of the mitral valve in anatomic textbooks were entirely adequate. With the im-petus provided by the work of Murray, 1 of Bailey 2 and of Harken and associates, 3 opera-tions for the relief of mitral stenosis are be-coming commonplace. Because of this, any anatomic factors which might affect the indications for operation, the technic used, or the postoperative prognosis would seem worthy of more careful consideration.

This paper explores the relationship between urban vegetation evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation indices derived from newly-developed high spatial resolution WorldView- 2 imagery. The study site was Veale Gardens in Adelaide, Australia. Image processing was applied on five images captured from February 2012 to February 2013 using ERDAS Imagine. From 64 possible two band combinations of WorldView- 2, the most reliable one (with the maximum median differences) was selected. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were derived for each category of landscape cover, namely trees, shrubs, turf grasses, impervious pavements, and water bodies. Urban landscape evapotranspiration rates for Veale Gardens were estimated through field monitoring using observational-based landscape coefficients. The relationships between remotely sensed NDVIs for the entire Veale Gardens and for individual NDVIs of different vegetation covers were compared with field measured urban landscape evapotranspiration rates. The water stress conditions experienced in January 2013 decreased the correlation between ET and NDVI with the highest relationship of ET-Landscape NDVI (Landscape Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for shrubs (r 2 = 0. 66) and trees (r 2 = 0. 63). However, when the January data <b>was</b> <b>excluded,</b> <b>there</b> was a significant correlation between ET and NDVI. The highest correlation for ET-Landscape NDVI was found for the entire Veale Gardens regardless of vegetation type (r 2 = 0. 95, p > 0. 05) and the lowest one was for turf (r 2 = 0. 88, p > 0. 05). In support of the feasibility of ET estimation by WV 2 over a longer period, an algorithm recently developed that estimates evapotranspiration rates based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS was employed. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between ETMODIS and ETWV 2 (r 2 = 0. 9857, p > 0. 05). This indicates {{that the relationship between}} NDVI using high resolution WorldView- 2 imagery and ground-based validation approaches could provide an effective predictive tool for determining ET rates from unstressed mixed urban landscape plantings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective: Intraarticular or periarticular {{injection}} of ropivacaine (RI) {{is an element}} of current knee surgery practices. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of RI on the mechanical properties of hamstring tendons. We hypothesized that RI would have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of periarticular soft tissuesMethods: A tensile test to failure was performed on 120 hamstring tendon segments harvested during ACL reconstruction surgery in 120 patients. Two sets of tensile tests were done. The first evaluated the effect of RI itself on the mechanical properties of tendons: 30 samples were soaked for 1 hour in a 2 % RI solution and compared to 30 samples soaked in a saline solution (control group). The second evaluated the effect of RI concentration on the mechanical properties of hamstring tendons: 30 samples were soaked for 1 hour in a 2 % RI solution and 30 samples were soaked in a 7. 5 % RI solution. Results: In the first test, 29 samples from each group were analyzed as two samples (one in each group) failed at the grip interface. The specimens exposed to 2 % RI had lower ultimate tensile strength (= 4. 4 MPa, P = 0. 001), strain energy (= 13 MPa, P = 0. 001) and Young's modulus (= 1. 6 MPa, P = 0. 02) than the specimens in the control group. There was no significant difference in the strain at failure between groups (= 5 %, P = 0. 3). In the second test, one specimen from the 7. 5 % RI group failed during the preloading and <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b> <b>There</b> was no significant difference in terms of the load at failure and ultimate tensile stress (= 0. 45 MPa, P = 0. 6) and strain energy (= 0. 49 MPa, P = 0. 49) between the two groups.

Discussion: While local RI injections are widely performed in clinical practice, the results of this in vitro study point to short-term alterations of the mechanical properties of hamstring tendons. If these results hold in vivo, this could lead to weakness of the soft tissues exposed to this product, particularly the tendons and ligaments around the injection area.
