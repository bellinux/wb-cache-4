40|$|HuR, a RNA binding protein, {{is known}} to {{function}} as a tumor maintenance gene in breast cancer and associated with tumor growth and poor prognosis. However, the cellular function of this protein remains largely unknown in normal mammary epithelial cells. Here, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> in immortalized MCF 10 A mammary epithelial cells, HuR knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and enhances premature senescence. <b>We</b> also <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> in three-dimensional culture, MCF 10 A cells with HuR knockdown form abnormal acini with filled lumen and an aberrant expression pattern of the extracellular matrix protein laminin V. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> HuR knockdown increases DNp 63, but decreases wild-type p 53, expression in MCF 10 A cells. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> DNp 63 knockdown partially rescues the proliferative defect induced by HuR knockdown in MCF 10 A cells. Consistent with this, we identified two U-rich elements in the 39 -untranslated region of p 63 mRNA, to which HuR specifically binds. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> HuR knockdown enhances DNp 63 mRNA translation but has no effect on p 63 mRNA turnover. Together, our data suggest that HuR maintains cell proliferation and polarity of mammary epithelial cells at least in part via DNp 63...|$|R

Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> C 57 BL/ 6 macrophages {{do not respond to}} IL- 18, since they do not express IL- 18 R.
