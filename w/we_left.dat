25|$|He {{procured}} me a Chinese interpreter, Fong Shi, {{a pleasant}} and agreeable young Chinaman, who wrote his mother-tongue with ease and spoke Jagatai Turki fluently, and—did not smoke opium. He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even before <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Khotan...........|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>left</b> the town, fleeing this living {{picture of}} Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, after {{finishing}} the tour for their sixth album Hail to the Thief (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. Songwriter Thom Yorke began recording The Eraser, his first solo release, with longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich in late 2004, and continued work throughout 2005 between Radiohead sessions. He told Pitchfork: [...] "I've {{been in the}} band since <b>we</b> <b>left</b> school and never dared do anything on my own ... It was like, 'Man, I've got {{to find out what}} it feels like,' you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jane Austen {{lived there}} from 1801 with her father, {{mother and sister}} Cassandra, and the family resided at four {{different}} addresses until 1806. Jane Austen never liked the city, and wrote to Cassandra, [...] "It will be two years tomorrow since <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Bath for Clifton, with what happy feelings of escape." [...] Bath has honoured her name with the Jane Austen Centre and a city walk. Austen's Northanger Abbey and Persuasion are set {{in the city and}} describe taking the waters, social life, and music recitals.|$|E
500|$|Ray Davies {{has claimed}} that he was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Lola" [...] after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a transgender woman. Davies said of the incident, [...] "In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until <b>we</b> <b>left</b> at {{six in the morning}} and then I said, 'Have you seen the stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [...] to care, I think".|$|E

500|$|Decades later, Simeon Wright, Till's cousin, also {{challenged}} the account given by Carolyn Bryant at the trial. Wright entered the store [...] "less than a minute" [...] after Till was left inside alone with Bryant, {{and he saw}} no inappropriate behavior and heard [...] "no lecherous conversation." [...] Wright said Till [...] "paid for his items and <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the store together." [...] In their 2006 investigation of the cold case, the FBI noted that a second anonymous source, who was confirmed {{to have been in}} the store {{at the same time as}} Till and his cousin, supported Wright's account.|$|E
500|$|Following the Hail to the Thief tour, Radiohead went on hiatus {{to spend}} time with their {{families}} and work on side projects. Jonny Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations between Greenwood and director Paul Thomas Anderson. In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, The Eraser, comprising mainly electronic music. He told Pitchfork: [...] "I've been in the band since <b>we</b> <b>left</b> school and never dared do anything on my own ...

500|$|Bride {{heard the}} band playing {{as he left}} the radio cabin, which was by now awash, in the company of the other radio operator, Jack Phillips. He had just had a fight with a man who Bride thought was [...] "a stoker, or someone from below decks", who had {{attempted}} to steal Phillips' lifebelt. Bride wrote later: [...] "I did my duty. I hope I finished [...] I don't know. <b>We</b> <b>left</b> him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving." [...] The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.|$|E

500|$|At a later banquet {{and public}} rally in Union Square, Victor Deleu {{addressed}} the civilian population, describing the Corps' arrival as a rescue mission: [...] "We had {{the duty of}} coming over here on this day, when you are living through such hardships. <b>We</b> <b>left</b> a foreign country, but did so with just one thought on our minds: coming home. That's why there was only road meant for us, the one leading us ahead. [...] We'll be the victors, for the Carpathians cannot reach as high as our hearts have been elevated!" [...] As politician Ion G. Duca recalled, no other speech left as deep an impression on the public: [...] "Deleu was a pure and simple marvel, something unforgettable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{report said}} that a large {{compound}} was being built at Auschwitz: [...] "Work is now proceeding on a still larger compound {{which is to be}} added later on to the already existing camp.

[...] Miroslav Kárný argues that, long after the war was over, Vrba wanted to testify about the deportations {{out of a sense of}} longing, to force the world to face the magnitude of the Nazis' crimes. The suspicion is that this led to a degree of embellishment in later accounts. Kárný wrote in 1998: ...|$|E
500|$|Beck began {{life in a}} {{rooming house}} near {{downtown}} Los Angeles. As a child, {{he lived in a}} declining neighborhood just off Hollywood Boulevard. [...] "By the time <b>we</b> <b>left</b> there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks," [...] he later recalled. The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, with Beck later remarking that [...] "I think they were kind of concerned" [...] about his [...] "weird" [...] home life. Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. Beck also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather, Al Hansen, a visual collage artist and a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement.|$|E
