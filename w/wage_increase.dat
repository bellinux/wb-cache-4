5|$|Mill {{workers in}} England became {{increasingly}} disenchanted with improper practices by factory owners, long working hours and unsatisfactory conditions. During the early 1850s workers {{throughout the country}} began to campaign for higher wages and strikes were held in several towns and cities; brickmakers in Manchester struck in January while woollen mill operatives in the West Riding of Yorkshire went on strike two months later. Grimshaw himself {{was involved in a}} strike in Stockport, where workers were demanding a ten percent <b>wage</b> <b>increase,</b> in March 1853.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a <b>wage</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the premier's chair Dunderdale {{was faced with}} an ongoing dispute between the province's doctors and government over contract negotiations. In November, 14 doctors announced their resignations over the government's latest offer of a 31percent <b>wage</b> <b>increase</b> that they felt was not enough. At her swearing in as premier Dunderdale stated that earlier that week she had asked Health Minister Jerome Kennedy and Finance Minister Tom Marshall {{to meet with the}} Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (NLMA) later that day to work out a resolution to the dispute. After the meeting Dunderdale announced she hoped to have a deal signed with the province's doctors before Christmas.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} argued that minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> {{can lead to}} {{increased}} inflation. This paper examines the impact of minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> on inflation in Vietnam during the 1994 - 2008 period. Inflation is measured by a monthly overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) and a monthly food CPI. It is found that the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> did not increase inflation. Since the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> often took place one or {{two months before the}} Vietnamese New Year festivals, observed increases in monthly inflation after the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> were caused by increased consumption demand during the New Year festivals, not by the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases.</b> ...|$|R

Using a panel data set of managers in the German chemical industry, we indeed find first evidence.

3000|$|... 5 Most {{collective}} wage agreements {{during the}} period have been {{for two or three}} years. However, the collective agreements, which are concluded at the industry level, mainly concern average <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> in firms. The distribution of <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> between individuals are negotiated each year {{at the level of the}} firm, very often without any guaranteed <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> for individuals. In some collective agreements, no numbers for <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> are specified at all; instead, <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> are determined in annual bargaining between individual union members and the employer. The wage-setting arrangements described could motivate a fairly quick response of individual wages to various changes in the economic environment.|$|R
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a <b>wage</b> <b>increase</b> to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a radical}} public speaker and orator, Grimshaw's early campaigns were centred on the {{improvement}} of working conditions for the mill-workers {{in the village of}} Royton and enforcement of the Factory Acts. He was an outspoken critic of the Whig Party and an advocate of the Chartist movement, in particular of their anti-Whig alliance with the Tory Party. Strikes among mill-workers began to break out during the early 1850s and Grimshaw was one of the leaders, along with George Cowell, of the strike in Preston in 1853. The strikers were fruitless in their demands for a ten per cent <b>wage</b> <b>increase,</b> and Grimshaw found himself with no further role in the workers' unions. He and his fellow conspirators were charged with conspiring to prevent people working in the mills, although the charges were later dropped.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent <b>wage</b> <b>increase</b> in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> on job {{satisfaction}} is explored. First, it is empirically confirmed that current job satisfaction rises with the absolute wage level {{as well as}} with <b>wage</b> <b>increases.</b> Second, a basic job satisfaction function is constructed based on the empirical results, and theoretical implications are analyzed. Myopic maximization of such a function directly implies increasing and concave shaped wage profiles.

25|$|President Truman {{referred}} {{the wage}} dispute to ODM's Wage Stabilization Board (WSB). In March 1952, the WSB recommended a 16.5-cent-an-hour <b>wage</b> <b>increase.</b> The steelmakers lobbied Congress, DOD and defense manufacturers, opposing any <b>wage</b> <b>increase</b> {{unless there was}} an accompanying price increase. The pressure led Congress to threaten to overturn any WSB <b>wage</b> <b>increase.</b> Republicans demanded that the president invoke the Taft-Hartley Act and force the steelworkers back to work. But Truman, needing labor's support in the 1952 presidential campaign, refused to do so.|$|E

30|$|We {{also present}} some {{analyses}} {{that attempt to}} use the synthetic control estimator to identify control observations and then estimate the effects of minimum wages on employment based on those controls. ADRZ criticize our matching estimator because the subset of “clean” minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> – treatments with donors that have no minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> in the previous four quarters and the following three – does not produce a negative and significant minimum wage effect (the estimated elasticity is only around − 0.06 in the state-level data). In particular, since we suggested in our paper {{that the fact that}} we do not replicate the standard panel data estimator using this subset of minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> made this subset of minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> “unusual,” they question whether it is valid to use this subset of increases to assess the plausibility of restricting attention to neighboring states as controls, as we do in our synthetic control analysis. We think it is useful to assess whether ADR and DLR throw out states or counties that are valid controls for the subset of minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> for which the analysis is cleanest. However, the answer does not depend on restricting attention to these minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we examine}} the interrelation between intra-firm <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> and firm performance. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the dispersion of wages in order to examine for the empirical dominance of positive monetary incentive effects compared to adverse effects due to fairness considerations. We argue that the dispersion of <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> rather than <b>wage</b> levels is a crucial measure for monetary incentives in firms. The larger the dispersion of <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> the higher the amount of monetary incentives in firms. In contrast, huge wage inequality without any promotion possibilities does not induce any monetary incentives. Evidence from unique Danish linked employer employee data shows that large dispersion of wage growth within firms is generally connected with low firm performance. The results are mainly driven by white collar rather than blue collar workers. Fairness, Firm performance, Inequality, Monetary Incentives, <b>Wage</b> <b>increases,</b> <b>Wage</b> Dispersion...|$|R

We find little evidence that minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> lead to improvements in overall worker health. In fact, we find some evidence that minimum <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> may decrease some aspects of health, especially among unemployed male workers. We also find evidence that increases reduce mental strain among employed workers...|$|R

25|$|The {{hearings}} {{opened with}} the Steelworkers arguing for a wage and benefit increase estimated between 30 and 50 cents an hour, while the employers claimed no increase whatsoever was possible without price relief. ODM director Charles E.

Office of Price Stabilization economists were disturbed by the union's request. A secret internal memorandum by OPS staff members indicated that the union was actually due a 22-cents-an-hour <b>wage</b> <b>increase,</b> and that the steel companies could absorb up to 40 cents an hour in additional costs without a price hike.
