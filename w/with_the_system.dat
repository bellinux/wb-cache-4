5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E

40|$|Protective {{measurement}} {{is a new}} {{measuring method}} introduced by Aharonov, Anandan and Vaidman (1993). By a protective measure-ment, one can measure the expectation value of an observable on a single quantum <b>system,</b> even if <b>the</b> <b>system</b> is initially not in an eigenstate of the measured observable. Aharonov, Anandan and Vaidman attributed this feature of protective measurements to a physical manifestation of the wave function of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> This interpretation was challenged by Uffink (1999, 2012). He argued that only observables that commute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system’s</b> Hamiltonian can be protectively measured, and a protective measurement of an observable that does not commute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system’s</b> Hamiltonian does not actually measure the observable, but measure an-other related observable that commutes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system’s</b> Hamiltonian. In this paper, we argue that there are several errors in Uffink’s arguments, and his alternative interpretation of protective measurements is untenable. ...|$|R

The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E
5|$|As the cyclone {{reached the}} western {{periphery}} of the ridge that steered it across the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a 105mph (165km/h) tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a baroclinic zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000UTC on September4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle's transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> resulted in large waves {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|Drifting {{generally}} northward, {{the disturbance}} slowly organized within {{a region of}} low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft. The circulation was enhanced by a surge of westerly winds to the south. At 06:00UTC on June29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression. Following further organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22:30UTC <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> located about 345km (215mi) northeast of Pohnpei.

One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program.
