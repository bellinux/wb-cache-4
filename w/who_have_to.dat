5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

25|$|The manga Dance in the Vampire Bund by Nozomu Tamaki {{features}} Mina Tepes as {{the ruler}} of the vampire world. The manga deals in part with her efforts to ease the tensions between the newly revealed vampire race and the humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live alongside them.|$|E
25|$|Cabellera contra cabellera ("hair versus hair"): {{the loser}} {{of the match}} has his head shaved bald.

25|$|Tongyong Pinyin is {{currently}} more useful for visitors and tourists unfamiliar with Mandarin {{than it is}} for residents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn Mandarin.

25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous to people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the Indian Government {{introduced}} in 2005 a five-year plan called the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) {{to bridge the}} vast rural-urban income disparities that have emerged as India’s information technology and service sector has boomed. The program has successfully empowered women and raised rural wages, but has also attracted the ire of landowners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay farm laborers more due to a higher prevailing wage. The projects tend to be highly labor-intensive and low skill, like dam and road construction, and soil conservation, with modest but positive long-term benefits and mediocre management.|$|E
