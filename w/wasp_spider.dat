40|$|The <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope bruennichi (Scopoli, 1772) is of Mediterranean-Pontian origin, but {{for decades}} {{it has been}} {{expanding}} northwards, including into the territory of Poland. Based on well-documented expansion records, we can distinguish "old" (south-eastern and south-western) and "new" populations (north-eastern), respectively, from the 1930 s to the 2000 s. In Poland, some populations of A. bruennichi {{were expected to be}} more genetically isolated from others, due to distance effects or differential times of arrival. We evaluated whether the oldest populations were in a state of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and whether recently founded populations were in an expansion phase. Specimens of A. bruennichi (n = 184) were collected at six localities in Poland and single sampling sites in Italy and Japan. Nine microsatellite loci were amplified although only five were useful in the final analyses. Based on the genotypes obtained, we estimated basic measures of genetic diversity and tested for deviation from HWE. The results showed a low level of polymorphism amongst the investigated markers, and accordingly, we found a low genetic diversity in populations. Only populations from Italy and Japan, and one population from Poland, were in HWE. The level of genetic differentiation among sampling sites from Poland was also very low. The high dispersal ability of the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> appears to have facilitated high gene flow among populations. The peripheral and recently settled populations were characterized by the highest heterozygosity and the lowest inbreeding coefficient (FIS). The remaining Polish populations are therefore still in the expansion phase, as indicated by deviations from HWE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Male monogyny in {{the absence}} of {{paternal}} investment is arguably one of the most puzzling mating systems. Recent evidence suggests that males of monogynous species adjust their life-history and their mating decision to shifting spatial and temporal selection regimes. In the cannibalistic <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope bruennichi males can be either monogynous or mate with a maximum of two females. We studied factors underlying male mating decisions in a natural population over a whole mating season. We documented all matings and categorized the males into single-mated and double-mated monogynous as well as bigynous males. Results We found that all categories were continuously present with relatively stable frequencies despite changes in the operational sex ratio. Males were more likely monogynous when copulating with relatively heavy and old females and otherwise bigynous. Conclusion Our results imply that males make conditional mating decisions based {{on the quality of the}} first female they encounter but do not adjust their mating tactic to the local selection regime. </p...|$|E
40|$|Natural history {{collections}} house {{an enormous}} amount of plant and animal specimens, which constitute a promising source for molecular analyses. Storage conditions differ among taxa and can have a dramatic effect on the success of DNA work. Here, we analyze the feasibility of DNA extraction from ethanol preserved spiders (Araneae). We tested genotyping success using several hundred specimens of the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider,</b> Argiope bruennichi, deposited in two large German natural history collections. We tested the influence of different factors on the utility of specimens for genotyping. Our results show that not the specimenâ€™s age, but the museum collection is a major predictor of genotyping success. These results indicate that long term storage conditions should be optimized in natural history museums to assure the utility of collections for DNA work. Using historical material, we also traced historical genetic and morphological variation {{in the course of a}} poleward range expansion of A. bruennichi by comparing contemporary and historical specimens from a native and an invasive population in Germany. We show that the invasion of A. bruennichi is tightly correlated with an historical increase of genetic and phenotypic variation in the invasive population...|$|E
40|$|Poleward range {{expansions}} {{are commonly}} attributed to global change, but could alternatively {{be driven by}} rapid evolutionary adaptation. A well-documented example of a range expansion during the past decades {{is provided by the}} European <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope bruennichi. Using ecological niche modeling, thermal tolerance experiments and a genome-wide analysis of gene expression divergence, we show that invasive populations have adapted to novel climatic conditions {{in the course of their}} expansion. Their climatic niche shift is mirrored in an increased cold tolerance and a population-specific and functionally differentiated gene expression response. We generated an Argiope reference genome sequence and used population genome re-sequencing to assess genomic changes associated with the new climatic adaptations. We find clear genetic differentiation and a significant admixture with alleles from East Asian populations in the invasive Northern European populations. Population genetic modeling suggests that at least some of these introgressing alleles have contributed to the new adaptations during the expansion. Our results thus confirm the notion that range expansions are not a simple consequence of climate change, but are accompanied by fast genetic changes and adaptations that may be fuelled through admixture between long separated lineages...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{competing}} explanations for the counter-intuitive presence of bright coloration in certain orb-web spiders. Bright coloration could lure insect prey to the web vicinity, increasing the spider's foraging success. Alternatively, the markings could function as disruptive camouflage, {{making it difficult for}} the insect prey to distinguish spiders from background colour variation. We measured the prey capture rates of wasp spiders, Argiope bruennichi, that were blacked out, shielded from view using a leaf fragment, or left naturally coloured. Naturally coloured spiders caught over twice the number of prey as did either blacked-out or leaf-shielded spiders, and almost three times as many orthopteran prey. Spectrophotometer measurements suggest that the bright yellow bands on the spider's abdomen are visible to insect prey, but not the banding on the legs, which could disguise the spider's outline. Thus, our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that bright coloration in the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> acts as a visual lure for insect prey and weak support for the hypothesis that the arrangement of the banding pattern across the spider's body disguises the presence of the spider on the web. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Summary of {{the thesis}} Rapid, poleward range {{expansions}} are observed for {{an increasing number}} of species in the past decades. These distributional changes are commonly attributed to global environmental change. Recent research, however, indicates that genetic adaptation might also {{play an important role in}} explaining the success of range expansions. Considering the fast pace of many range expansions, such contemporary evolutionary processes are unlikely to rely on the emergence of new mutations. Instead, standing genetic variation acts as important resource to fuel adaptation. This variation can be present in a populationÂ´s gene pool or it is introduced by secondary contact and admixture of formerly isolated genetic lineages. In the past years, ample evidence has been compiled for an association of admixture, adaptation and range expansions for numerous plant and animal species. Here, I present an analysis of the recent range expansion of the European <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope bruennichi. Originally, this species inhabited the Mediterranean region and warm oceanic climates in France and South-Western Germany. From around 1930 onwards, the spider started expanding its range into increasingly continental climates and can now be found as far north as Finland. This thesis aims to disentangle environmental and genetic factors, involved in the speciesÂ´ range expansion. In particular, I analyze the interconnection of genetic admixture and invasion success. I approach these questions using population genetic and phylogeographic methods, morphological analyses, ecological experiments and finally whole genome- and transcriptome sequencing. In chapter one, I conduct a detailed genetic and ecological analysis of the spiderÂ´s range expansion. I base this study on a dense sampling of more than 2. 000 contemporary specimens. In addition, I include about 500 historical spiders from natural history collections. I present genetic and morphological data, as well as several ecological experiments on thermal tolerance and preference and a reciprocal transplant study. My results indicate that the spiderÂ´s range expansion is associated with admixture of formerly isolated genetic lineages from around 1930 onwards. The ecological experiments indicate that invasive spider populations have simultaneously adapted to colder temperatures by shifting their thermal preference and tolerance. Like many other spider species, Argiope bruennichi has a wide ranging Palearctic distribution. In chapter two, I conduct a phylogeographic survey over the speciesÂ´ whole range, from the Macaronesian islands over Europe to East Asia. Next to Argiope bruennichi, I include a second widely distributed spider species, the nursery web spider Pisaura mirabilis. The study is based on mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. I highlight the importance of outer-European glacial refugia for the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider.</b> I then show the effects of secondary contact in shaping the postglacial genetic structure of the two species. The analysis identifies several instances of incongruent phylogenetic patterns for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, possibly due to recurrent selection on mitochondria. DNA from natural history collections provides a valuable resource to trace historical genetic changes during range expansions. For that reason, I present an analysis of DNA sequencing and microsatellite genotyping success in historical spider specimens in chapter three. In addition, I exemplarily illustrate the utility of historical specimens to trace historical genetic changes in populations. In the above chapters, I have presented evidence for admixture leading to differential adaptation in spider populations. However, the functional basis of this adaptation remains unknown. For that reason I embark towards unraveling its genomic architecture in chapter four. Initially, I generate the first available draft genome sequence of a spider species. Based on this data, I analyze genome-wide differences of native and invasive <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> populations across an environmental gradient. Gene regulatory evolution is a possible mechanism to provide the means for rapid contemporary adaptation to environmental stress. For this reason, I conduct a genome-wide gene expression analysis of native and invasive wasp spiders, which have been exposed to temperature stress in chapter five. I discuss the gene expression divergence between Northern and Southern European spiders in relation to the possibility of recent contemporary adaptation.

40|$|Aim The phylogeographical {{history of}} wide-ranging Palaearctic species {{is not well}} understood. Here, we present a range-wide phylogeographical study of the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider,</b> Argiope bruennichi (Scopoli, 1772), a highly {{dispersive}} and widely distributed Palaearctic species. We aim to identify glacial refugia and patterns of interglacial gene flow across the Palaearctic. Location Palaearctic region, including the Azores, Madeira, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Methods We conduct a range-wide phylogeographical survey. Our study is based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers, as well as morphological characters. We use species distribution models to predict the speciesâ€™ current range {{as well as its}} historical distribution during and shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results All analysed genetic markers and morphological characters support the divergence of a lineage in eastern Asia from the remainder of the Palaearctic. Within the Western Palaearctic, a less pronounced divergence into an Azorean and a European clade is found. Species distribution models predict a pronounced loss of suitable habitat for Western Palaearctic lineages during the LGM, whereas the range of East Asian populations remained largely unaffected. Main conclusions Our results highlight the existence of non-European glacial refugia for Palaearctic species, particularly in East Asia. The current genetic structure is best explained by the recent recolonization of the Western Palaearctic from eastern Asia, or repeated interglacial contact of populations...|$|E

40|$|Poleward range {{expansions}} {{are observed}} for {{an increasing number}} of species, which may be an effect of global warming during the past decades. However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the <b>wasp</b> <b>spider</b> Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasionâ€™s genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences...|$|E
