5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore <b>wings</b> and no hind <b>wings</b> (Copholandrevus), others lack hind <b>wings</b> and have {{shortened}} fore <b>wings</b> in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind <b>wings</b> longer than the fore <b>wings.</b> In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind <b>wings</b> longer than fore <b>wings</b> engage in flight.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack <b>wings</b> and thus never fly, and the reproductives use their <b>wings</b> {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying <b>wings.</b> In beetles, the first pair of <b>wings</b> {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of <b>wings</b> has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
50|$|A closed <b>wing</b> is a non-planar <b>wing</b> {{that uses}} a {{continuous}} surface, eliminating the <b>wing</b> tips. Closed <b>wing</b> designs include the annular <b>wing</b> (commonly known as the cylindrical or ring <b>wing),</b> the joined <b>wing,</b> the box <b>wing</b> and spiroid tip structures.|$|R
50|$|Placing engines on the <b>wing</b> {{provides}} beneficial <b>wing</b> bending {{relief in}} flight. The further the engines are {{away from the}} fuselage the greater the <b>wing</b> bending relief so engines buried in the <b>wing</b> root provide little relief. Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from the <b>wing</b> root for substantial <b>wing</b> bending relief. The pods are {{in front of the}} <b>wing</b> to help avoid flutter of the <b>wing</b> which, in turn, allows a much lighter <b>wing</b> structure. Locating the pod below the <b>wing</b> provides each engine with air undisturbed by the fuselage or <b>wing.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new <b>wings</b> and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 <b>wings</b> with options for 125 additional <b>wings.</b> In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 <b>wings,</b> putting 173 <b>wings</b> on order with options remaining for 69 additional <b>wings.</b> In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new <b>wings</b> fitted. The new <b>wings</b> improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E

5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter <b>wings</b> {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF <b>Wings.</b> Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed by the unit number; e.g. I./JG 1.

Partly {{as a result of}} JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter <b>wings</b> incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E
5|$|Insect <b>wings</b> are {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold their <b>wings</b> when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their <b>wings</b> spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold their <b>wings</b> sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their <b>wings</b> around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their <b>wings</b> together straight upward over the back.|$|E
40|$|The canard had {{an exposed}} area of 28. 0 {{percent of the}} <b>wing</b> {{reference}} area and was located in the chord plane of the <b>wing</b> or in a position 18. 5 percent of the <b>wing</b> mean geometric chord above or below the <b>wing</b> chord plane. The canard leading edge sweep was 51. 7 deg and the <b>wing</b> leading-edge sweep was 60 deg. The {{results indicated that the}} direct canard downwash effects on the <b>wing</b> loading are limited to the forward half of the <b>wing</b> directly behind the canard. The <b>wing</b> leading-edge vortex is located farther forward for the <b>wing</b> {{in the presence of the}} canard than for the wing-alone configuration. The wake, from the canard located below the <b>wing</b> chord plane, physically interacts with the <b>wing</b> inboard surface and produces a substantial loss of <b>wing</b> lift. For the Mach number 0. 70 case, the presence of the <b>wing</b> increased the loading on the canard for the higher angles of attack.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>wing</b> kinematics, <b>wing</b> morphology and the brachial index of birds (BI=humerus length/ulna length) was examined. BI {{was found to}} differ between three groups of birds, which were classified {{on the basis of}} similar <b>wing</b> kinematics. In addition, a comparative analysis of a large dataset, using phylogenetically independent contrasts, suggested a significant, albeit weak, correlation between BI and four measures of <b>wing</b> morphology (<b>wing</b> loading, <b>wing</b> area, <b>wing</b> length and aspect ratio). Although <b>wing</b> kinematics and <b>wing</b> morphology are both correlated with BI in birds, the dominant selective pressure upon this ratio is probably <b>wing</b> kinematics. The previously identified clade specificity of BI within Neornithes is most likely because birds with similar BIs fly with kinematic similarity and closely related birds have similar flight styles. A correlation between BI and <b>wing</b> kinematics means that {{it may be possible to}} characterize the <b>wing</b> beat of fossil birds. A more robust {{relationship between}} <b>wing</b> morphology and BI may emerge, but only after the relationship between <b>wing</b> kinematics and BI is quantified. A comparative and quantitative study of wing-bone anatomy and <b>wing</b> kinematics is a priority for future studies of avian wing-skeleton evolution and functional morphology. <br/...|$|R
