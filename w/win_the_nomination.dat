5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Bryan arrived {{quietly and}} took rooms at a modest hotel; the Nebraskan later {{calculated}} {{that he spent}} less than $100 while in Chicago. He arrived convinced that he would <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> He had already begun work on a speech. On the evening of July 5, Bryan was visited by a delegation of Coloradans, seeking his support for Senator Teller. They went away apologetically, not having known Bryan sought the nomination.|$|E
5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls {{for the first}} half of 2007. He proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} run for Congress. He did hint to state party leaders {{that he would be}} interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E

5|$|Three Democratic {{candidates}} {{had announced}} intentions {{to run for}} governor in 1899—Goebel, former Kentucky Attorney General P. Wat Hardin, and former congressman William J. Stone. Hardin, a native of Mercer County, had the backing of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Lyon County's Stone had the backing of the state's agricultural interests. Goebel generally had the backing of urban voters. Going into the party's nominating convention, Hardin was the favorite to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Knowing that combining forces {{was the only way to}} prevent Hardin's nomination, representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19, 1899, to work out a deal. According to Urey Woodson, a Goebel representative at the meeting, the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation, which was committed to Goebel, would vote for Stone. Both men agreed that, should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race, they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin.|$|E
5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign}} that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Johnson's withdrawal, Humphrey was {{hit with}} a barrage of media {{interest}} and fanfare. His aides Max Kampelman and Bill Connell began to set up an organization and held meetings with Humphrey and his advisors, encouraging him to start a campaign. Humphrey set up offices for preparation, and unsuccessfully courted Larry O'Brien as campaign manager. O'Brien explained that his loyalties lied with the Kennedy family, leaving Humphrey undecided on whom to hire. Connell added lawyer and former DNC Treasurer Richard McGuire, who established the temporary campaign headquarters at his law firm. Eventually, Humphrey decided to embrace the youth of politics, adding Senators Fred R. Harris and Walter Mondale, who agreed to lead the Democrats United for Humphrey organization. Harris was put in charge of winning delegates, and Mondale prepared for the convention, helping to keep an organization in place. Kampelman, Connell and McGuire questioned Humphrey's decision to hire the Senators, explaining that they had no organizational experience. Humphrey worried about his organization in the state of Iowa, but Harris and Mondale assured him that what would be lost in the state would be made up in Maryland. The campaign believed they could build a coalition of southern and border state Democrats as well as Union and Civil rights leaders to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Mondale and Harris also desired to add a few anti-war liberals to the coalition. Meanwhile, Humphrey's office constantly received calls urging him to announce. Congressman Hale Boggs and Senator Russell Long, both of Louisiana, warned Humphrey that if he did not declare his candidacy soon, Kennedy would secure the nomination. Labor leader George Meany also called for Humphrey to announce immediately, but when Humphrey explained {{that he did not want}} to rush into a campaign, Meany called President Johnson to demand that Humphrey announce. Johnson refused, and never explicitly asked Humphrey to run. Governors Harold Hughes of Iowa and Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, each advised Humphrey to resign as Vice President to separate himself from Johnson, but he declined. Before the official announcement, Humphrey met with Johnson and discussed the future. The President advised Humphrey that his biggest obstacle as a candidate would be money and organization, and that he must focus on the Midwest and Rust Belt states in order to win.|$|E

50|$|On August 3, 2006, Bryson <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> {{to run for}} Governor against {{incumbent}} Phil Bredesen. Bryson, {{upon entering}} the race immediately assumed the position of front-runner for <b>the</b> Republican <b>nomination,</b> since <b>the</b> other announced contenders were political near-unknowns and the state party endorsed him before <b>the</b> primary. Bryson <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> with a vote total approximately {{equal to that of}} all of his rivals combined.|$|R

25|$|Nearly {{two years}} before the election, South Dakota Senator George McGovern entered the race as an anti-war, {{progressive}} candidate. McGovern was able to pull together support from the anti-war movement and other grassroots support to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> in a primary system he had played a significant part in designing.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy, {{like his}} brother before him, planned to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> through popular {{support in the}} primaries. McCarthy and Kennedy squared off in California, each knowing that the state would make or break them. They both campaigned vigorously {{up and down the}} state, with many polls showing them neck-and-neck, and a few even {{predicting}} a McCarthy victory.|$|E

25|$|Stassen {{sought the}} presidential {{nomination}} {{again at the}} 1952 Republican National Convention, and helped Dwight D. Eisenhower <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> by shifting his support to Eisenhower. After serving in the Eisenhower administration, Stassen sought various offices. Between 1958 and 1990, he campaigned unsuccessfully for the positions of Governor of Pennsylvania, Mayor of Philadelphia, United States Senator, Governor of Minnesota, and United States Representative. He sought the Republican nomination for president in 1964, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} Whig, Tayloe supported Henry Clay for President in 1840. When Clay did not <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> Tayloe supported William Henry Harrison, and {{his efforts}} on Harrison's behalf led the new President to {{consider him a}} confidante. Tayloe also {{played an important role}} in Henry Clay's unsuccessful 1844 candidacy for President of the United States. He made many friends among the diplomatic corps, among them the Belgian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary Comte Auguste Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz, with whom he met in 1843 (the Comte departed in 1844) and kept up a 20-year correspondence.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{received}} enough superdelegate endorsements on June 3 {{to claim}} that he had secured the simple majority of delegates necessary to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> and Clinton conceded the nomination four days later. Obama was nominated on the first ballot, at the August convention. He {{went on to win}} the general election, and became the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009. Clinton went on to serve as Obama's Secretary of State for his first term as president, and was the 2016 Democratic nominee for president.|$|E

25|$|Complicating the {{equation}} for Democrats, presidential candidate John McCain clinched the Republican nomination on March 4. With Obama and Clinton {{engaged in the}} Democratic primary, McCain was free to define his candidacy for the general election largely unchallenged. Some Democrats expressed concern that Clinton stayed in the campaign through March and April, when they felt she had little chance to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> but a much greater chance to damage Obama's candidacy in the general election. However, others defended Clinton's right to continue on, arguing that a sustained campaign {{was good for the}} Democratic Party and that Clinton still had a realistic shot at the nomination.|$|E
25|$|After {{his father}} {{announced}} his retirement from Congress in 1992, Jones ran for his father's seat in North Carolina's 1st congressional district. He ranked first in the Democratic primary with 38% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> In the run-off election, he was defeated by Eva Clayton, Chairwoman of the Warren County Board of Commissioners, {{by a margin of}} 55%–45%. Clayton received support from three of the defeated primary candidates and from the African American community. Jones Sr. died before his term expired, and Clayton was elected to served the last two months of his term.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{after the}} last of the {{primaries}} had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected.|$|E
