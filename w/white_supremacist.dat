5|$|Media {{sources have}} {{characterized}} /pol/ as predominantly racist and sexist, {{with many of}} its posts taking an explicitly neo-Nazi bent. The Southern Poverty Law Center regards /pol/'s rhetorical style as widely emulated by <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> websites such as The Daily Stormer; the Stormers editor, Andrew Anglin, concurred.|$|E
50|$|The case {{attracted}} the attention of <b>white</b> <b>supremacists.</b> On May 27, 2007, around 30 <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> led by Alex Linder rallied in downtown Knoxville in order to protest against the murders. They were met by counter-protesters, many of whom were dressed as clowns (parodying the Ku Klux Klan).|$|R

5|$|Although their {{suspected}} <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> affiliations led {{federal authorities}} to investigate possible ties {{to a larger}} group, authorities later downplayed the trio as drug addicts who had little chance of actually carrying out the plot.

5|$|The alleged {{motive for}} the {{attempted}} assassination was a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> belief that an African American should not be elected President of the United States. Gartrell was arrested August 24, 2008, and found to be in possession of rifles and other weaponry; Adolf and Johnson were arrested shortly thereafter. In a televised interview after his arrest, Johnson identified Adolf {{as the man who}} allegedly hatched the assassination plot and planned to be the shooter.|$|E
5|$|After the Santa Ana Register {{published}} its article, {{a nationwide}} network of activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the anti-Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C.

5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E

Some observers, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, say that the term's usage has been rising among <b>white</b> <b>supremacists</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847– July 3, 1918) was a {{politician}} of the Democratic Party {{who served as}} Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 {{until his death in}} 1918. A <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> {{scientist}} Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise {{and useful}} {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E

5|$|White {{nationalist}} {{websites such as}} Stormfront and Counter-Currents {{have taken}} issue with {{what they see as}} lowbrow coverage on The Daily Stormer, as well as Anglin's defense of Christianity and denunciation of the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> group Christian Identity. Kyle Rogers of the Council of Conservative Citizens has also criticized the website for reprinting its material. Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881– September 14, 1966) was Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, an American <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> group, from 1922 to 1939. A {{native of}} Alabama, Evans {{attended}} Vanderbilt University {{and became a}} dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, {{when he joined the}} Klan's Dallas chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted William Joseph Simmons from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} term, Ross {{was forced to}} {{intervene}} in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a <b>white</b> <b>supremacist</b> church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate.|$|E
