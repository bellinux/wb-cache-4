As mentioned in the literature, difficulties remain in separating the respective contributions of grain size and water on the reflectance continuum. This paper deals with the evaluation of a new methodological approach, the Spectral Derivative–Modified Gaussian Model (SD-MGM) for establishing the relationship between the spectral features and the geophysical properties of sediments. The SD-MGM enables the deconvolution of spectra into two main components: (1) Gaussian curves for the absorption bands and (2) a straight line in the wave number domain for the portion of the spectrum that represents continuum. While the retrieved Gaussian features are known to be reliable indicators of the composition, it is shown that the retrieved continuum can be used as a novel approach for determining grain size and water content. Based on regression analyses between the SD-MGM spectral output parameters and the geophysical properties, a quantitative relationship between water content and the way in which the shape of the water band depth at 0. 97 [*]µm and 2. 8 [*]µm changes has been found during dehydration. It is shown that it is possible to separate three water types present in the sediment structure: saturated, free, and adsorbed waters with high coefficients of determination (r 2) of 0. 97, 0. 98, and 0. 94, respectively. The continuum is also revealed to be a useful <b>water</b> <b>content</b> <b>indicator</b> because it is less affected by atmospheric effects...|$|E
40|$|The least {{limiting}} {{water range}} (LLWR) was introduced as an integrated soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> <b>indicator,</b> measuring {{the impact of}} mechanical impedance, oxygen and water availability on water uptake and crop growth. However, a rigorous definition of the upper limit of the LLWR using plant physiological and soil physical concepts was not given. We introduce in this study an upper limit of the LLWR, based on soil physical and plant physiological properties. We further evaluate the sensitivity of this boundary to different soil and crop variables, and compare {{the sensitivity of the}} upper limit of the LLWR to previous definitions of soil water content at field capacity. The current study confirms that the upper limit of the LLWR can be predicted from knowledge of the soil moisture characteristic curve, plant root depth and oxygen consumption rate. The sensitivity analysis shows further that the upper limit of the LLWR approaches the volumetric soil water content at saturation when the oxygen consumption rate by plants becomes less than 2 A mu mol m(- 3) s(- 1). When plants are susceptible to aeration (e. g. potato and avocado), {{there is a big difference}} between the upper limit of the LLWR and the soil water content at field capacity, in particular for sandy soils. Results also show that the soil water content at aeration porosity corresponding to 10 % cannot be considered as an appropriate upper limit of LLWR because it does not appropriately reflect the crop water requirements. Similar poor results are obtained when considering the soil water content at matric potential - 0. 033 MPa or when defining the soil water content at field capacity based on drainage flux rate. It is observed that the upper limit of the LLWR is higher than either soil water content at - 0. 033 MPa matric potential or soil water content at field capacity as based on drainage flux rate, especially in sandy soils...|$|E
40|$|Half of world’s food {{comes from}} {{irrigated}} area that uses about 72 % of available water resources. In Morocco, water availability {{is the main}} limiting factor for crop growth and final yield and it is becoming a national priority for the agricultural sector. This situation leads the stakeholders to define most favorable strategies in planning and management of available water resources, on one hand, and to assess accurately vegetation water content status, on the other hand, {{in order to improve}} irrigation scheduling and prevent water stress adversely affecting yield. Remotely sensed reflectance has been used to estimate vegetation water content for different crops and to monitor water irrigation per surface unit, considering its high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, we used two spectral indices of vegetation <b>water</b> <b>content</b> <b>indicator</b> (the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Moisture Stress Index (MSI)) developed using Near Infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands. The study area is the irrigated perimeter of Tadla in Morocco (35 % dominated by irrigated wheat crop). In a first step, we compared observed vegetation water content of 16 studied plots of wheat and derived spectral indices NDII and MSI at the end of cropping season. The two images used at this step were acquired on March 26, 2013 and on April 11, 2013 when soil was fully covered by vegetation. Statistical analyses showed that the two spectral indices, NDII and MSI, simulated accurately vegetation water content. The statistical indicators, r, R², RMSE, nRMSE and MAE were - 0. 81, 0. 65, 3. 26 % of water content (≈ 0. 13 kg/m²), 4. 26 % and 2. 69 % for the NDII and 0. 81, 0. 65, 3. 27 % of water content (≈ 0. 14 kg/m²), 4. 27 % and 2. 72 % for the MSI, respectively. To validate these results, we compared observed vegetation water content values and those predicted using the k-fold CV method. The errors were minimal for NDII and MSI, and the indicators of model evaluation obtained for predicted vegetation water content from NDII were: RMSE = 3. 17 %, nRMSE = 4. 13 %, MAE = 2. 52 % and R²= 0. 64. For MSI, these indicator were RMSE = 3. 28 %, nRMSE = 4. 29 %, MAE = 2. 68 % and R²= 0. 61. In a second step, we delimited the cereal area in the studied perimeter using a supervised classification method. The classification has been validated and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were estimated respectively at 96. 7 % and 0. 9545. Based on the regression model resulting from the comparison between NDII and measured vegetation water content, we produced maps of vegetation water content of wheat over the whole Beni-Moussa East irrigated area (41, 000 hectares). The results of this work demonstrated the potential of spectral indices (NDII and MSI) derived from SPOT 5 satellite images data to quantify and map vegetation water content of wheat. It showed also the potential of the SWIR band to improve the monitoring of irrigation by mapping water stress of wheat at field and regional level. Peer reviewe...|$|E
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of low <b>water</b> <b>content</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of drought {{at the four}} regions (Tables  6, 7) shows high variability between baseline and projections for maize and wheat (Table  1). The western regions showed an increase of percentage of days below the soil water threshold during flowering in the med and max projections, in particular at sites DH and FL. The eastern regions revealed an opposite trend. This was partly due to single severe drought events as the year 2003 which had strong impact on the abundances identified. The comparison of wheat and maize revealed a more pronounced increase of drought conditions for wheat, in particular between inflorescence emergence and milk ripe.|$|R

In this study, physiological traits were examined in plants growing outdoors, in the proximity of a road. All material was collected from robust, well-grown plants. All measurements were performed during the generative phase. Here, the evaluations of some gravimetric parameters (fresh weight, turgid weight, dry weight, <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> ash content) and physiological parameters (initial <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> mineral content, organic content, organic content/mineral content ratio, succulence, mineral deposition in tissues, tissues density, leaf relative <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> specific leaf area) were calculated for Taraxacum officinale from urban unmanaged areas, across the different seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare these traits in leaves, scapes, and roots. Initial <b>water</b> <b>content</b> and relative <b>water</b> <b>content</b> are good <b>indicators</b> of water status in T. officinale. With regard to succulence, its level was generally considerably lower in roots than in aboveground organs. The mineral content differed significantly among plant organs. For all the parameters analyzed, the most considerable seasonal differences were found in leaves. The Spearman correlations were calculated for the relations between plant traits. Mineral deposition in tissues is the most sensitive parameter, regardless of the organ. The data were subjected to Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis for each physiological parameter and some meteorological factors. The strongest association was generally found with the wind. Variations in the investigated parameters in roots and scapes are more associated with meteorological factors. Taraxacum officinale plants are able to tolerate urban conditions in proximity to a road.

If the climate in a given region gets drier and warmer, water availability will decrease and be exacerbated by increasing water demand [[16]]. Soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> and therewith irrigation in agriculture {{is likely to be}} affected by higher temperature. Evapotranspiration sensitively depends on temperature regimes [[38]]. For temperate regions with a highly variable rainfall pattern, it is difficult to predict to which extent temperature changes will require a modification of agricultural practices. We use regional climate model data generated by STARS II [[39]] based on the RCP 8.5 scenario together with information on regional soil conditions [[40]], crop types and pattern of the current agricultural practice (by courtesy of J. Hufnagel and N. Svoboda, Leibnitz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Müncheberg, Germany) to assess whether {{it would be possible to}} continue the current cultivation pattern in Uelzen or whether adaptations and changes of the current irrigation pattern and crop management would be necessary to avoid critical conditions and crop losses - based on the assumption of a validity of the climate change scenario. Therefore, we developed the evaporation calculation model BewUe (Bewässerung (irrigation) Uelzen) to estimate the irrigation requirement using soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> as an <b>indicator.</b> The presented work is part of a larger crop rotation simulation endeavour covering further Northern German regions. The computed irrigation data are essential for preparing the study of current and future water, carbon and nitrogen balances within the NaLaMa-nT project.

This study describes clinical and laboratory experiments that were conducted in order to examine the state of water in eight soft contact lenses manufactured from different materials. Specifically, lenses made from the following eight materials (and nominal <b>water</b> <b>contents)</b> were used: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % [HEMA = 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP = vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA = methyl methacrylate, MAA = methacrylic acid]. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used for measuring the free <b>water</b> <b>content</b> in the materials listed above. Some noticeable differences in water properties among soft contact lens materials having approximately the same <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> were revealed. Low <b>water</b> <b>content</b> materials exhibited a simple endotherm and all water melted around 0 degrees C. On the other hand, medium and high <b>water</b> <b>content</b> materials exhibited multiple melting endotherms, representing a broad range of interactions between water and the polymer. Low <b>water</b> <b>content</b> soft contact lenses have approximately the same amount of bound water as those with much higher <b>water</b> <b>contents.</b> Six subjects were then fitted with the same lenses for one day. In vitro measurements of <b>water</b> <b>content</b> and oxygen transmissibility were taken at 35 degrees C, both before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. <b>Water</b> <b>content</b> and oxygen transmissibility were correlated with the water {{properties of}} the soft contact lens materials.

40|$|Wild rice (Zizania palustris) is a newly {{cultivated}} crop that {{is known}} for its quality compounds of human healts benefits. Zizania seeds are extremely sensitive to drought during the maturing and storage period. This study was conducted to examine the effect of seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> on genomination in three Zizania species, Z. aquatica, Z. latifolia and Z. palustris that have different morphological grain characteristics. Grain <b>water</b> <b>content</b> in the range of 9 to 83 % showed a positive correlation with germination rate and speed. It was greatly affected by humidity during seed desiccation period. Seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> was higher in the varieties or strains of larger grains than in those of smaller grains, also, in unhulled than in hulled grains. Seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> decreased rapidly within 2 weeks of desiccation. Decreased seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> was closely related to the decreased rapidly within 2 weeks of desiccation. Decreased seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> was closely related to the decreased germination rate and speed in most Zizania species. Seed germination rate was maintained over 80 % in <b>water</b> <b>content</b> over 35 % in all Zizania species except for Z. latifolia from Sunchon bay that showed very low germination. However, seed germination at <b>water</b> <b>content</b> belo 35 % was significantly different by the seed size but not necessarily by the species. Seed viability of 50 % was observed at 20 % of seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> in the small grain Z. aquatica from Virginia, while at about 10 - 13 % of <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in the large grain Z. aquatica Iowa and Z. palustris. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that <b>water</b> <b>content</b> of mature wild rice seeds is a critical factor in germination, and it is affected mainly by humidity during seed maturation. Post-harvest practices to maintain seed <b>water</b> <b>content</b> in the range of 20 to 50 % should improve wild rice seed viability...|$|R
40|$|Common {{conceptual}} {{models for}} unsaturated flow often {{rely on the}} oversimplified representation of medium pores as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries and assume that the matric potential is attributed to capillary forces only. The adsorptive surface forces are ignored. It is often assumed that aqueous flow is negligible when a soil is near or at the residual <b>water</b> <b>content.</b> These models are successful at high and medium <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> but often give poor results at low <b>water</b> <b>contents.</b> These models {{do not apply to}} conditions at which <b>water</b> <b>content</b> is less than the residual <b>water</b> <b>content.</b> We extend the lower bound of existing water-retention functions and conductivity models from residual <b>water</b> <b>content</b> to the oven-dry condition (i. e., zero <b>water</b> <b>content)</b> by defining a state-dependent, residual-water content for a soil drier than a critical value. Furthermore, a hydraulic conductivity model for smooth uniform spheres was modified by introducing a correction factor to describe the film flow-induced hydraulic conductivity for natural porous media. The total unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is the sum of those due to capillary and film flow. The extended retention and conductivity models were verified with six datasets from the literature. Results show that, when the soil is at high and intermediate <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> there is no difference between the un-extended and the extended models; when the soil is at low <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> the un-extended models overestimate the <b>water</b> <b>content</b> but under-estimate the conductivity while the extended models match the retention and conductivity measurements well...|$|R
