5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

He notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now sure of what course he should take. The final shot of the episode is a montage of the ships named Enterprise as Captains Picard, Kirk, and Archer recite the [...] "Where no man has gone before" [...] monologue.|$|E
500|$|Bears, {{like other}} animals, may symbolize nations. In 1911, the British satirical {{magazine}} Punch published a cartoon about the Anglo-Russian Entente by Leonard Raven-Hill {{in which the}} British lion <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Russian bear sits on {{the tail of the}} Persian cat. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onwards. [...] Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message [...] "Only you can prevent forest fires". In the UK, the bear and staff feature on the heraldic arms of the county of Warwickshire. Bears appear in the canting arms of two cities, Bern and Berlin.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask, staring at her. Panicked, she stumbles into the hallway, and <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E
500|$|Consecutively, {{during the}} song's bridge, Carey <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> small child's mother carries {{her to a}} nearby {{playground}} where her friends are frolicking and playing. Similarly, the elderly man is met with some other elderly citizens, who accompany him to another building nearby. During the song's climax, Carey joins the choir, flailing her hands wildly towards the sky, and smiling and gazing into the cloudy morning. Renee Graham from The Boston Globe gave the video two out of four stars. She complimented {{on the fact that}} the video captured the song's lyrical essence and how it managed to portray it in a clear and concise way. Although calling it [...] "simple," [...] Graham commented that [...] "Videos have never really been Mariah Carey's thing, and frankly, they've never had to be. Carey has a killer voice, so the last thing she'd want to do is overshadow her singing with a lot of choreography, complicated story lines or explosions." [...] Author Chris Nickson compared several parts of the video to religion and belief in God. During such scenes when Carey appears with the choir, he felt it seemed as though they were both channeling a common entity through music; God. Additionally, he claimed it was more evident with each passing scene of the video, as each of the lonely people in the video gaze up into the skies, possibly praying or searching for an answer to their loneliness. A video was commissioned for the C+C club mix of the song. Known as the C+C video edit, it was also directed by Danielle Federici and serves as a behind the scenes addendum to the main music video. It is also filmed in black and white, and is composed of clips of Carey and her friends during filming of the video, where they chat, laugh and enjoy time with each other. Carey's husband at the time Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance in the video, appearing alongside Carey during the second verse. The remix video was later included on the 1995 home video release, [...]|$|E
2500|$|The whole {{apartment}} <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> prostitute {{jumps up}} and down naked, and hits a giggling, equally naked Orr {{on the head with}} her heeled shoes. Each time she jumps and hit him, Orr giggles louder, making her even more angry. She then would jump even higher and hit him harder, causing him to giggle even more. The vicious cycle ends after fifteen to twenty minutes when she knocks him out cold with a good whack to his head, leaving him with a concussion [...] "that kept him out of combat for only twelve days." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{songs in}} Magic express disillusionment {{with the state}} of American society in 2007 in particular; others, such as the title track (with its lyrics of [...] "I got a shiny saw blade/All I need's a volunteer/I'll cut you in half/While you're smilin' ear to ear"), convey a more general sense of foreboding. [...] "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" [...] has been cited as a {{singularly}} [...] "breezy" [...] song on the album, though A. O. Scott of The New York Times notes that not even this track is [...] "untouched by melancholy. Its narrator, after all, stands and <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> girls of the title 'pass me by.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gollum then {{leads the}} hobbits to the Cross Roads where {{they see a}} vandalized statue of a king of Gondor. [...] They then reach the evil city of Minas Morgul, and Frodo <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Witch-King leads the Morgul army out and toward Minas Tirith. [...] They then climb up a long, steep {{staircase}} of the Cirith Ungol and into a tunnel when Gollum disappears. [...] The tunnel is actually the lair of an enormous spider named Shelob. Gollum hopes to get the Ring from Frodo's bones after Shelob is done with him. The hobbits escape Shelob in her lair using {{the light of the}} Phial of Galadriel and mistakenly assume that they are safe. However, Shelob sneaks up on Frodo. Sam attempts to warn Frodo but is attacked by Gollum. Shelob stings Frodo {{in the back of the}} neck and he collapses to the ground. Sam fends off Gollum, who runs off back towards Shelob's cave. Sam then fights Shelob, and eventually drives her off by wounding her with Frodo's blade, Sting and the Phial.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} escape his father, Clark decides {{to use a}} kryptonite key to destroy his spaceship. When Clark puts the kryptonite key into the spaceship, Beck and his FX team tried to create a [...] "virus/fungus" [...] growth from the key slot to {{simulate}} [...] "some sort of fractal decay". Mike McCormick worked specifically {{on the process of}} destroying the ship, giving the ship the appearance that it has a [...] "nasty skin infection" [...] that is spreading as if it is caught in the circulatory system. Next, Beck had to tackle the problem of the ship's final destruction. Originally, it was intended to have the ship explode, but no one wanted to have to rebuild the Kent farm. Instead, they settled on a giant EMP wave given off by the ship the moment it is destroyed. Entity FX created a beam of light that shot vertically up from the ship's location and then fell back down expanding into a [...] "ripple that spread across the land". This beam of light would create a crater where the storm cellar was, which was dug prior to filming and digitally covered up so as to keep the illusion. One of the final shots of the episode was of Lex watching as his plane crashed into the ocean. In a homage to Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, Entity FX crafted a digital effect of the ocean water flooding Lex's plane as it hits the ocean. The scene is reminiscent of the same scene in Cast Away where Tom Hanks's character also <b>watches</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ocean water floods his plane as he crash lands in the ocean.|$|E
