5|$|After {{the match}} with Morphy, Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch, {{one of the}} leading players of the time, who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess. Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and {{narrowly}} won in 1861 (5/9; won four, drew two, lost three; Kolisch <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> at the half-way stage).|$|E
5|$|In {{its initial}} broadcast, this episode {{received}} a Nielsen rating of 5.1/8, totaling 8.88 million viewers in the 18–19 demographic. The episode ranked {{one of the}} lowest in the 9:00PM timeslot, behind The Amazing Race on CBS, Sunday Night Football on NBC, and Desperate Housewives; however, it <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of fellow Fox animated sitcom American Dad!, which was shown immediately after Family Guy.|$|E
5|$|Simpson had totaled 1025yards in {{the first}} half of the season, which <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of the 971 Brown had gained in his first seven games. The Saints posted all their scoring {{in the first}} half and kept the Bills to under 200yards of total offense while {{shutting}} them out.|$|E
5000|$|Almost every army {{you look}} at <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of the American Army, as far as taking care of our infantry.

Almost {{everybody}} has a better infantry vehicle than the U.S. Army. We {{would have been better}} off in 1963 when we started to just build the MICV immediately. Are we to start over again? My guess is that if you start over again, you will have a 10 percent increase in effectiveness and 50 percent increase in cost. General William E. DePuy, testimony to Congress, 1977.|$|R

5|$|The {{legality}} of about 600 absentee ballots were contested during the count, including Senator Gillibrand's ballot. By April 23, Murphy <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> by 401 votes, and Tedisco conceded the following day. Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29. The official results came out in May and had Murphy winning the election with 80,833 votes (50.23%) against Tedisco's 80,107 votes (49.77%).|$|E
5|$|With 100 {{percent of}} precincts reporting, initial counts from the {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated {{between the two}} candidates throughout early recanvassing; {{at one point the}} New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> by 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> {{of its time}} {{was the use of}} dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|Diane gives Marty {{a tape of}} Tommy's 1999 Olympic trial fight. Tommy <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> {{after two}} rounds but quit before round three because of a hand injury. Marty realizes that Tommy faked his injury because of the poor {{coaching}} and abuse coming from his stepfather, who was serving as his cornerman. Marty and Tommy talk about Tommy's stepfather and Marty's former fighter. Marty tells Tommy that boxing is a team sport and that Tommy will never be alone in the ring.

5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of long-standing WIBF belt holder Regina Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF Flyweight titles {{in her hometown of}} Hamburg on December 7, 2007. She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored {{during the second half of}} the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E

Judah {{was knocked}} out by Khan in the 5th round after Khan landed an uppercut body shot. Judah was unable to answer the referee's 10 count, thus recording his 7th career loss. Khan <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> 40-36 on all three judges score cards {{at the time of}} the knock out. Judah was adamant that the body shot should have been called low and claimed that he had been expecting a mandatory five-minute recovery period.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} {{formation}} lap, Heinz-Harald Frentzen stalled his Sauber whilst attempting {{to leave the}} grid {{and was forced to}} start from the pitlane. The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill {{to the back of the}} field and was forced to make a pitstop in order to fit a new nose cone. Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and {{little in the way of}} notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E

5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth-century to operate such a system.

The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones <b>was</b> <b>ahead</b> of its time and never moved forward.|$|E
5|$|Before the race, Red Bull driver Mark Webber led the Drivers' Championship with 187points.

Both drivers would mathematically stay in contention if Alonso or Vettel won the race and neither McLaren driver finished in points-scoring positions. Red Bull were leading the Constructors' Championship with 426 points; McLaren and Ferrari were second and third with 381 and 334 points respectively, while Mercedes on 176 points and Renault on 133 contended for fourth place.
