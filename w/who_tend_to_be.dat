5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives {{have been diagnosed with}} Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, about 9% of {{the entire}} Spanish {{population}} attends religious services at least once per month. Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with FXS {{may present}} {{anywhere}} {{on a continuum}} from learning disabilities {{in the context of}} a normal intelligence quotient (IQ) to severe intellectual disability, with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the FMR1 gene. Females, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less affected, generally have an IQ which is normal or borderline with learning difficulties. The main difficulties in individuals with FXS are with working and short-term memory, executive function, visual memory, visual-spatial relationships, and mathematics, with verbal abilities being relatively spared.|$|E

25|$|In a {{reversal}} of the demographics of party alignment in the post-Civil War nineteenth century, in the 21st century state, Democrats include liberal whites, African Americans, and other minorities. As of October 2017, 50.39% of the state's voters were officially registered as Democrats, 41.10% were registered Republican, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conservative whites. Some 8.51% were registered with some other political party or as Independents. Despite this, the majority of persons who vote in the state have generally elected Republican candidates for federal office since {{around the turn of the}} 21st century.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{highways}} {{are in good}} condition, with little traffic congestion. Infrastructure on the highways is well maintained. This also tends to be true for cities and towns that are served or are in close distance with the freeways. However, this does not yield truthfully for cities and towns <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considerably further from the main highway roads. Nicaraguan bus companies, {{often referred to as}} Chicken Buses, serve both urban and rural areas to remedy the lack of sufficient infrastructure that plagues these towns or villages.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, {{tend to be very}} socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of a more liberal persuasion, most of these people are not U.S. citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E

25|$|Improved {{nutrition}} {{is another}} possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult {{of a century}} ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been {{at a rate of}} more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain. This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs. Richard Lynn, however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.|$|E
500|$|The book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon noted Mewtwo {{as popular}} with older male {{children}} <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn to [...] "tough or scary" [...] characters; Mew in contrast {{was described as}} a polar opposite, a character popular with young girls <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn to [...] "cute" [...] characters. Others books, such as Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children, have noted a similar comparison, citing Mewtwo as [...] "more aggressive-looking" [...] compared to Mew and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children. The book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific compares Sugimori's design of Mewtwo to that of Japanese tokusatsu films, namely monster films like the 1954 Godzilla in creating [...] "monstrous yet familiar silhouettes from the past renewed agency in the form of eyes and expressions which cut through the viewer".|$|E
500|$|According to The New York Times, {{students}} [...] "share a love {{of books}} [...] a disdain for the conventional style of education.

Shimer has historically averaged 125 students, and enrolled 97 in 2014. Most Shimer alumni go on to graduate studies.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{balanced}} {{statistics and}} ability to learn any move {{that comes from a}} Technical or Hidden Machine, Mew is {{regarded as one of the}} best Pokémon in Red, Blue, and Yellow. Studies on the impact of fictional characters on children, such as those in Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, have noted Mew as popular with younger female children <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn to [...] "cute" [...] characters; Mewtwo in comparison was described as a polar opposite, popular with older male children <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn to [...] "tough or scary" [...] characters. The book Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children noted a similar comparison, describing Mew as [...] "child-like and gentle, combining characteristics of power and cuteness" [...] and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children between it and Mewtwo, and its role as a source of appeal for the character. IGN listed Mew as one of the best Psychic types, alongside Mewtwo, Alakazam, and Starmie. They called it a good contender to Mewtwo, as well as an unpredictable Pokémon due to its ability to use any TM or HMs, items that teach Pokémon attacks.|$|E
500|$|Described by {{the media}} as [...] "a lean, ferocious, fire-breathing dragon [...] sleek, powerful, and utterly destructive", Charizard has been noted {{as one of the}} franchise's [...] "most popular" [...] characters. Retailers have {{attributed}} the high sales of merchandise related to the character to the popularity of the character's dragon-like design with children. Interviewed children have stated similar; they attributed its appeal to its [...] "cool looking" [...] appearance and associating the character with the [...] "concepts of stubbornness and power". The book Rebuilding Attachments With Traumatized Children stated psychiatrists utilized the character as an empowered character traumatized children who were fans of the Pokémon series could relate to. The book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon cited Charizard as [...] "popular" [...] with older male children <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn to [...] "tough or scary" [...] characters, and compared the character's evolution from Charmander into Charizard with the loss of [...] "cuteness" [...] as one leaves childhood.|$|E
2500|$|A {{building}} {{associated with}} a group of open brethren is usually called a [...] "Gospel Chapel," [...] "Gospel Hall," [...] "Bible Chapel," [...] "Christian Assembly," [...] or other similar term.

Theologically, however, they differ very little.|$|E

2500|$|In Texas, {{some debate}} occurs on the Texas Forensic Association (TFA) level.

[...] TFA is geared towards the larger schools/programs <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in the suburban}} areas in the major cities {{in the eastern part}} of the state. [...] The other type of debate is UIL. UIL is open to all public schools throughout Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Mehserle {{retained}} Pleasant Hill {{criminal defense}} attorney Michael Rains, who previously successfully represented one of the Oakland Riders. Before Mehserle retained Rains, the attorney had told the Associated Press {{that it could be}} difficult to prosecute Mehserle for murder because the law discourages [...] "second-guessing and hindsighting" [...] of police officers, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> favorably viewed by juries. Mehserle's defense was paid for by a statewide fund for police officers.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to {{the number}} of viewers present, {{collectivism}} versus individualism can influence impression formation. Collectivists are at ease as long as their impressions are largely in alignment with the larger group's impressions. When a collectivist wants to change his/her impression, he/she may be compelled to change the views of all group members. [...] However, this could be challenging for collectivists, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less confrontational than individualists. Individualists are willing change their own views at will and are generally more comfortable with uncertainty, which makes them naturally more willing to change their impressions.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of data. It suggests, firstly, that {{individuals}} who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be [...] "perfectly justified" [...] form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims [...] "Politically Radicalized". They chose that title [...] "because of their radical political orientation" [...] and clarify [...] "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups." [...] The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better educated than moderates.|$|E
2500|$|For many {{indigenous}} students (such as Native American children), motivation may {{be derived}} from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in sociolinguistics and cognition. While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, Top-down classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage. Horizontally structured, community-based learning strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating indigenous children, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> driven by [...] "social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and nonverbal communication." [...] This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations {{of participation in the}} activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.|$|E
2500|$|Asahifuji {{made his}} {{professional}} debut in January 1981. He was already 20 years old, considerably older than most new recruits <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 15 or 16.

He reached the second highest jūryō division after only eight tournaments, a record that stood unbeaten until 2008. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division in March 1983. He won his first special prize for Fighting Spirit in the November 1984 tournament, where he finished runner-up. He reached sekiwake rank {{for the first time in}} January 1986. After regular training sessions at Takasago stable, where he knew Asashio from his university days, he began to develop a more rounded technique, and after three double figure scores he was promoted to sumo's second highest rank of ōzeki after the September 1987 tournament.|$|E
