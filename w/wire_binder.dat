40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{the structure of}} the resin bonded abrasive wire saw manufacture equipment. The equipment can complete the process of the wire saw production, including uncoiling wire, cleaning <b>wire,</b> <b>binder</b> coating, Pre-curving and coiling wire. Wire saw are manufactured successfully by this equipment in the manufacture experiment. The quality of the wire saw was examined by SEM. The average slicing ability of the wire saw is 205 mm 2 per meter in the experiment of KDP crystal slicing...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the fabrication of superconducting SmFeAsO 1 -xFx (Sm- 1111) wires {{by using the}} ex-situ powder-in-tube technique. Sm- 1111 powder and a binder composed of SmF 3, samarium arsenide, and iron arsenide were used to synthesize the superconducting core. Although the F content of Sm- 1111 is reduced {{in the process of}} ex-situ fabrication, the binder compensates by sufficiently supplementing the F content, thereby preventing a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature and a shrinkage of the superconducting volume fraction. Thus, in the superconducting Sm- 1111 <b>wire</b> with the <b>binder,</b> the transport critical current density reaches the highest value of ~ 4 kA/cm 2 at 4. 2 K. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
3000|$|Very {{high-speed}} {{digital subscriber}} line (VDSL) systems optimize the use of available bandwidth of the telephone lines for broadband transmissions [1]. This advanced technology can support the deployment of [...] "triple play services" [...] by providing high data rates (potentially upto 100 Mbps) through copper wires. Twisted pairs (TPs) run from the central office (CO) to the respective customer premise equipments (CPEs) {{in order to provide}} dedicated data rates for each user. The use of the higher bandwidth frequencies (upto 30 MHz) generates electromagnetic couplings that cause significant crosstalk among TPs, which degrades the performance of VDSL systems. The crosstalk that originates from the subscribers enjoying similar DSL service in a coordinated system is referred to as self-crosstalk [2]. In addition to the self-crosstalk, alien crosstalk that arises from other sources (for example, radio ingress) and non-coordinated users (enjoying other DSL services) severely limits the rates obtained by the VDSL systems [3]. Differential-mode (DM) processing that uses voltage differences between the two wires of the TP for the signal transmission and reception is a conventional technique to reduce the interferences, including radio ingress. In spite of this, crosstalk is the major performance limiting factor for the high-bandwidth VDSL systems. Another factor limiting data rates is the significant attenuation with large loop lengths, resulting in marginal data rates even when all upstream bands are used. We demonstrate in this article that use of common-mode (CM) signals can result in significant enhancement in rates in VDSL systems as compared to systems using DM-only processing. In addition, it can help deal with alien crosstalk. The additional CM signal can be obtained by using the arithmetic mean of the voltages, measured between each wire of the TP and ground [4]. It is shown in [4] that this CM signal can be readily obtained with very little extra hardware. The CM channel can also be realized by using an alternative reference point like binder sheath [5] or one of the <b>wires</b> in the <b>binder</b> [6].|$|R
