5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is <b>why</b> <b>in</b> any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain <b>why</b> <b>in</b> the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been {{associated}} with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who {{was at the end of}} 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E
