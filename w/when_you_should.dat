25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although <b>you</b> <b>should</b> bathe it with mild soap only if or <b>when</b> necessary; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|R

One for Christmas, another for Easter, and six days after that. They have also bounded how many syllables must be said {{in every one of}} them at their public exercises. For each saint's day, also, they have them ready for the generations yet unborn to say. They can tell you, also, when you shall kneel, when you shall stand, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> abide in your seats, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go up into the chancel, and what you should do when you come there. All which the apostles came short of, as not being able to compose so {{profound}} a manner; and that for this reason included in this scripture, because the fear of God tied them to pray as they ought.|$|E

My dear Tavy, your pious English {{habit of}} {{regarding}} {{the world as}} a moral gymnasium built expressly to strengthen your character in, occasionally leads you to think about your own confounded principles <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be thinking about other people's necessities.
