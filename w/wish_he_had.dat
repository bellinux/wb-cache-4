So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible truth {{is that he was}} murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son to pay tribute to her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only the thought of her child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but she thinks it wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says {{it will be difficult to}} get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E
500|$|Politicians {{generally}} reacted along party lines, with Senator Mundt stating, [...] "Nixon's {{speech is}} complete vindication {{against one of}} the most vicious smears in American history." [...] Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> talked about the 18,000 bucks—not the puppy dog... Suppose someone sets up a fund to buy my meals. I could say I didn't get one red cent of the money." ...|$|E

500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither touch his honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his victory}} in the 1985 Memorial Tournament, Irwin had {{occasional}} top-10 finishes in tournaments {{for the rest of}} the 1980s, but he did not have a further official PGA Tour win until an incredible year in 1990, which was capped by his third U.S. Open victory. In a remarkable tournament, Irwin holed an improbable [...] birdie putt on the 72nd hole to join a playoff against fellow American Mike Donald. In the 18-hole Monday playoff, Donald was two shots ahead of Irwin with three holes to play. Donald missed a 15-foot par putt on the 18th which would have given him victory. Both men shot rounds of 74 in the playoff and Irwin won the title with a birdie on the first sudden-death playoff hole. After becoming the oldest ever U.S. Open champion at the age of 45, winning his first PGA Tour event for five years, Irwin was gracious in victory. He said of his playoff opponent Mike Donald: [...] "God bless him. I almost <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won." ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry the Young King died, aged 28, in {{the summer}} of 1183, {{during the course of a}} {{campaign}} in Limousin against his father and his brother Richard. He had just completed a pillage of local monasteries to raise money to pay his mercenaries. He contracted dysentery at the beginning of June. Weakening fast, he was taken to Martel, near Limoges. It was clear to his household that he was dying on 7 June, when he was confessed and received the last rites. As a token of his penitence for his war against his father, he prostrated himself naked on the floor before a crucifix. He made a testament and, since he had taken a crusader's vow, he gave his cloak to his friend William Marshal, with the plea that he should take the cloak (presumably with the crusader's cross stitched to it) to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. On his deathbed, he reportedly asked to be reconciled to his father, but King Henry, fearing a trick, refused to see him. He died on 11 June, clasping a ring his father had sent instead as a sign of his forgiveness. After his death, his father is said to have exclaimed: [...] "He cost me much, but I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lived to cost me more." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} East Yokozuna on the May banzuke, {{the first time a}} Japanese wrestler has held the highest {{position}} since Takanohana in July 2001. He withdrew from the tournament on Day 11 having lost four matches, due to his failure to recover from his upper body injuries and inability to use his left arm properly. Nishiiwa Oyakata, a coach at Tagonoura stable, said that Kisenosato had suffered from a lack of preparation time. [...] "He only had about a week to practice against wrestlers before the meet. You would usually train for about a month after healing from injury, so I <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> more time. I hope {{he will be able to}} live up to fans’ expectations at the Nagoya basho." [...] The only previous time Kisenosato has withdrawn from a tournament in his 15-year career was the final day of the January 2014 tournament. Kisenosato declared himself fit for the July tournament but lost to Mitakeumi on the opening day and Tochinoshin on Day 3. He then withdrew from the tournament on Day 6 after suffering a left ankle ligament injury in his defeat the previous day to Ikioi. His stablemaster said, [...] "The pain in his left arm seems to be gone but he hasn't been able to put on good sumo." [...] He began full training for the Aki basho with 13 practice bouts with Yago of the jūryō division on September 4, but admitted he [...] "had a long way to go." [...] Shibatayama Oyakata commented, [...] "He is not in a condition to engage in bouts at a sumo tournament. I felt that he was just testing how much he has recovered from his injuries." [...] On September 7 Kisenosato's stablemaster confirmed that he would sit out the tournament, saying [...] "it takes courage to rest, and I hope this break will turn things in the right direction." ...|$|E
