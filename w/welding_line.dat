After the major destruction of the company during the Second World War in 1945, KUKA started manufacturing welding machines and other small appliances again. With new products such as the double-cylinder circular knitting machine and the portable typewriter [...] "Princess", KUKA introduced new industrial fields and gained independence from the supply sector. In 1956, KUKA manufactured the first automatic welding system for refrigerators & washing machines and supplied the first multi-spot <b>welding</b> <b>line</b> to Volkswagen AG. Ten years later, the first friction welding machine went into production. In 1967, the arc welding method was applied {{for the first time}} at KUKA. In 1971, the delivery of the first robotic welding system for the S-Class took place. A year later, the magnetic arc-welding machine came to the market.|$|E

In order to study the <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> developing process and its influence on surface finish in micro injection moulding, a variotherm system mould was used. The effect of TCIM on mechanical properties {{in the region of}} the <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> is also the subject of the present work. In this mould, a visualization design was integrated. A tensile bar sample and a flat cavity with an obstacle were used for the study of two main types of <b>weld</b> <b>line.</b> The tensile specimens were produced applying different processing parameters. <b>Weld</b> <b>line</b> depth and surface roughness are determined using an atomic force microscope. <b>Weld</b> <b>line</b> strength of micro tensile samples were tested on the micro tensile test machine. Results showed that the shape of <b>weld</b> <b>lines</b> and roughness are mainly influenced by mould temperature and its interaction with the injection speed. It is necessary to increase the temperature to 10 °C higher than Tg to obtain a glossy surface without <b>weld</b> <b>lines.</b> The cooling time of the injected part also affects the <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> depth. Elevated mould temperature and low injection speed were shown to improve <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> strength for each material in the experiment. <b>Weld</b> <b>line</b> strength was shown to be inversely proportional to the impingement velocity. Candidate reasons include air entrainment in the mating surface and superheating of the air compressed air in the region affecting the polymer behavior.

40|$|Abstract. Application of {{tailor welded blanks}} (TWBs) in {{automobile}} industry and aircraft manufacturing have been increased during past few years. Efficient material distribution and decreasing weight of the final part {{are some of the}} most important advantages of TWBs. Since tailor welded blanks are produced with at least two dissimilar and uniform or non-uniform thickness materials, they show different behavior than uniform materials during deep drawing process. In this research, the effect of <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation on formability in deep drawing of tailor-welded blanks is examined using finite element simulation and experiments. The thinning behavior of the circular TWBs during a deep drawing in a square die is studied for different <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientations between two mild-steel blanks with different thicknesses. The numerical and experimental results indicate that the orientation of the <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> direction of the blank sheet has significant influence on the deformation behaviour. It is seen that thinning behavior is similar for two sections of TWB for the same <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation. In addition, the most thinning occurs at 45 degree rotation of <b>weld</b> <b>line,</b> thus appropriate <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation or the tailor blank sheets direction orientation can improve the formability of the tailor-welded blank in a deep-drawing of square cup...|$|R
