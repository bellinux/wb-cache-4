5|$|A team {{named the}} Toronto Maple Leafs {{competed in the}} inaugural season of the National Lacrosse Association, a {{professional}} box lacrosse league, in 1968 at MLG. MLGL owners Ballard and Stafford Smythe <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the five founding partners of the club, but financial difficulties forced MLGL to take over ownership midway though the season. The NLA suspended operations prior to the following season.|$|E
5|$|After having {{problems}} with drugs and alcohol, drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired. Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed his drum parts. Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright {{in the summer of}} 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK. Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the drummers auditioned.|$|E

5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona and Nevada <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the top offenses in the country, ranking 7th and 10th in {{yards per game}} respectively. There was also {{significant}} hype surrounding the game because it featured {{two of the best}} running backs in the country, Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona, and Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada. Carey was ranked number one in the country in total rushing yards, while Jefferson was ranked number two. The duo were also prolific scorers; Jefferson was second in the country in rushing touchdowns with 25 and Carey was third with 24. The game was widely expected to be a shoot-out, as both teams were in the top-20 scoring offenses in the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury has a non-selective {{education}} system, {{assessed by}} the SATs exam. There are seven primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School {{is one of those}} chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951. Parrs Wood and The Barlow <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> only six schools in Manchester to achieve the Manchester Inclusion Standard in 2007, awarded by Manchester Council to those schools doing innovative work to ensure that all their pupils are able to participate fully in the school's activities.|$|E

They deferred admission for one year, and attended the university from 2011 to 2015.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the four guns from the battery.|$|E

5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In September 1278, King Edward I of England granted {{lands to}} Tudur and his brothers. The {{majority}} of the noble houses in Wales sided with the Welsh forces during the English invasion of Gwynedd, but Edward proclaimed that any who joined him would retain their lands and titles under the English crown. Tudur Hen retained his prestige and lands {{after the death of}} Llywelyn in 1282 and the victory of the English. Tudur and his brother Goronwy <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> those lords who backed the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn against the English in 1294–95. Tudur acted as steward to Madog, while Goronwy was in his service.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the Yucatán Peninsula was still {{dominated}} by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} county {{boundaries}} of Lancashire, {{until the early}} 19th century, Great Bolton and Little Bolton <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the eighteen townships of the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors. These townships were separated by the River Croal, Little Bolton on the north bank and Great Bolton on the south. Bolton Poor Law Union was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started {{to build a new}} workhouse at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth.
