5|$|Asher Levi is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from , an Internet spin-off of the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Played by Heshima Thompson, Asher is a main character in series two. He is a charismatic street dancer, who uses his talent {{to escape from}} his criminal past. As a father-figure to his younger brother Sol Levi (Tosin Cole), Asher occasionally resorts to stealing {{in order to provide}} for them both. He is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> extreme lengths to protect Sol, including being stabbed by their schizophrenic mother. Over the course of the series, Asher betrays Sol by sleeping with his girlfriend, Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen). The two are ultimately able to reconcile, and Asher makes amends by encouraging his brother's dancing talent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E

25|$|Minister {{of foreign}} affairs Karel De Gucht and Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said that Israel {{has the right to}} defend itself, but has now responded with {{excessive}} violence. Verhofstadt also called for the release of the captured Israeli soldiers. The Belgian-Lebanese leader of the Arab European League, Dyab Abou Jahjah, expressed his <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Lebanon to fight against Israel.|$|R

25|$|Preparations {{for the war}} {{continued}} into {{the spring and summer}} of 1AD, at which point there had been a successful breakthrough in negotiations. As Phraates was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, he agreed to evacuate Armenia and abandon his brothers who were still in Roman captivity. In the second half of the year, Gaius had advanced with his army to the Pharthian frontier to an unknown spot and brought Phraates to a final agreement on the proposals, in which he renounced all claims to Armenia and all power over his half-brothers.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of Munster's support was demonstrated during Munster's 2006 and 2008 Heineken Cup final wins. News reports detailed the lengths that fans were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> secure {{tickets to the}} game, with some Munster fans travelling to Biarritz to buy up the French allocation of tickets. On {{the day of the}} game the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was filled with a capacity crowd of 74,500. Of those numbers it is estimated that somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000 were Munster fans with the remainder being neutrals and Biarritz supporters. The Millennium Stadium was intended to be a neutral venue but commentators on the day remarked that it could hardly be counted as such. In North America there is an official supporters club called Munster Rugby USA.|$|E

25|$|Ava {{was not yet}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{war with}} Pegu over Toungoo. Instead, the king sought another way, and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Gov. Saw Yan Naung of Prome. In 1375, Yan Naung {{proposed}} a marriage of state between his daughter and Pyanchi's son, Pyanchi II, with the marriage ceremony to be held in Prome (Pyay). Pyanchi understood the proposal of marriage to be the first step toward joint rebellion against Ava. A Toungoo−Prome axis backed by Pegu would form a formidable Lower Burma bulwark against Central Burma-based Ava. Pyanchi I agreed to the proposal, and went to Prome with a small battalion. It was a trap. The Toungoo contingent was ambushed near Prome, and Pyanchi was killed although his son and son-in-law Sokkate both escaped.|$|E
25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the European Americans, in the late 19thcentury the Nez Perce split into two groups: one side accepted the coerced relocation to a reservation and the other {{refused to give up}} their fertile land in Idaho and Oregon. Those <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a reservation made a treaty in 1877. The flight of the non-treaty Nez Perce began on June15, 1877, with Chief Joseph, Looking Glass, White Bird, Ollokot, Lean Elk (Poker Joe) and Toohoolhoolzote leading 2,900 men, women and children in an attempt to reach a peaceful sanctuary. They intended to seek shelter with their allies the Crow but, upon the Crow's refusal to offer help, the Nez Perce tried to reach the camp in Canada of Lakota Chief Sitting Bull. He had migrated there instead of surrendering after the decisive Indian victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.|$|E
25|$|Aegina {{had always}} {{been exposed to the}} raids of corsairs and had oppressive {{governors}} during these last 30years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a bakshish to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the voivode who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.|$|E

25|$|Trade had an {{important}} weight in the economy, as Bulgaria lay between the Byzantine Empire, Central Europe, the Rus' and the steppes. Trade relations with the Byzantine Empire was regulated on a most favoured nation basis by treaties that included commercial clauses. The first such treaty was signed in 716 and determined that goods could only be imported or exported when provided with a state seal. Goods without documents were to be confiscated for the state treasury. The Bulgarian merchants had a colony in Constantinople and paid favourable taxes. The relevance of international trade for Bulgaria was evident, as the country was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with the Byzantine Empire when in 894 the latter moved the market of the Bulgarian traders from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where they had to pay larger taxes {{and did not have}} direct access to goods from the east. In 896 the war was won and the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation restored and commercial restrictions – abolished. Some Bulgarian towns acquired great prosperity, such as Preslavets on the Danube that was described in the 960s as being more prosperous that the capital of the Rus', Kiev. A contemporary chronicle lists the main trade partners and chief imports to Bulgaria. The country imported gold, silks, wine and fruits from the Byzantine Empire, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, furs, honey, wax and slaves from the Rus'. There were commercial ties with Italy and the Middle East as well.|$|E
25|$|Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes {{plans to}} escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison {{so she can}} {{eventually}} reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises they {{have gone to a}} local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him {{that there should be no}} more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered in cuts and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again.|$|E
500|$|The second {{scene of}} the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men, who had {{attempted}} to leave the freighter. Gault's actor Grant Bowler explained that [...] "it was a scene about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [...] the freighter … It was also {{about his ability to}} run the ship and that he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> such great lengths to keep order.

500|$|John Schneider plays Jonathan Kent, Clark's adoptive father, {{who goes}} {{to great lengths to}} protect his son's secret; {{according}} to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail, or worse, to protect his son." [...] Schneider was written out of the show in the series' 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack on the night of his election victory. Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.|$|E
500|$|Holloway is an {{archaeologist}} and Shaw's love interest. Marshall-Green was cast {{after he was}} seen performing on stage [...] "off-off-off Broadway". He described Holloway as the [...] "X Games-type scientist", {{and said that he}} liked the character's [...] "leap-before-looking" [...] philosophy. He also said that Holloway [...] "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the edge to get that." [...] Describing the character's motivation, he said: [...] "he goes to the extreme in everything he does, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the [...] I think what drives him is the thrill of the search."

500|$|Icke and {{his family}} moved in 1982 to Ryde on the Isle of Wight. His {{relationship}} with Grandstand was shortlived–he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him–but he continued working for BBC Sport until 1990, often on bowls and snooker programmes, and at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious. In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the Community Charge (also known as the [...] "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by Margaret Thatcher's government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement that he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.|$|E

500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail, or worse, {{to protect}} his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to}} the relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E
500|$|In 1903, {{at the age}} of 27, Rupert {{took over}} his late father's role as {{chairman}} of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, Claridge's, The Berkeley Hotel, Simpson's-in-the-Strand and the Grand Hotel in Rome. [...] At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708. [...] He immediately issued £300,000 of debentures to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the [...] "East Block"). [...] Like his father, Carte was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels. [...] When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the Élysée Palace in Paris. [...] The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous maître d'hôtel, M. Joseph, a few years earlier.|$|E

According to Williamson: [...] "The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac , John's prior assistant, didn't want to go... The deal was: would I be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..." [...] It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: [...] "...he was terrific. He's the best guy I ever had by far." [...] During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise.|$|E
