Bit like 24-hour flu, really." [...] Alex Henderson from Allmusic called the song [...] "an ultra-infectious gem that, unfortunately, isn't on any of the Material Girl's [...] CDs" [...] and felt that [...] "'Gambler' is one of those songs that should have been a major hit but wasn't, whereas 'Crazy for You' soared {{to the top of the}} pop charts." [...] > Overview |last=Henderson|first=Alex|date=September 8, 1985|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 5, 2010}} Alfred Soto of Stylus Magazine, described [...] "Gambler" [...] as a [...] "disco-punk, Flashdance edition" [...] and called it [...] "the most aggressive track of Madonna's career." [...] Soto added, [...] "'Gambler' is the only possible response to a slow dance in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> left as unfulfilled as you were five minutes earlier. It deserves immortality beside 'Into the Groove' [...] The music is keyed to her vocalsâ€”insistent, strident, hip-thrusting; she slurs the line [...] "You're just jealous 'cuz you can't be me" [...] like it's a shot of Rumplemints; meanwhile Animotion synths blow up her skirt. Robert Christgau gave a mixed review of the song. R. Serge Denisoff and William D. Romanowski, authors of Risky business: rock in film, felt that the song seemed [...] "jammed into the movie with a plunger and little thought to appropriateness." [...] The Motion Picture Guide of 1986 included the song as one of the soundtrack's standouts.|$|E

This definition is naturally extrapolated to events in gravitationally-curved spacetimes, and to accelerated observers, through use of a radar-time/distance definition that (unlike the tangent free-float-frame definition for accelerated frames) assigns a unique time and position to any event.|$|E

"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet {{here for}} the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee {{something}} of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".|$|E
