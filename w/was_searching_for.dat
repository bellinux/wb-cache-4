5|$|In 2005, {{two of the}} {{original}} columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The Regional Arts & Culture Council <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using the photographs for reference.|$|E
5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E

50|$|Knuth {{observed}} that a naive implementation of his Algorithm X would spend {{an inordinate amount}} of time <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> 1s. When selecting a column, the entire matrix had to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> 1s. When selecting a row, an entire column had to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> 1s. After selecting a row, that row and a number of columns had to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> 1s. To improve this search time from complexity O(n) to O(1), Knuth implemented a sparse matrix where only 1s are stored.|$|R

5|$|After its {{game against}} Northwestern, Michigan {{traveled}} to East Lansing to battle their in-state rival, the Michigan State Spartans, for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> its first win against Michigan State since 2007. Michigan State won the previous meeting 34–17. The Wolverines wore legacy road uniforms {{for the game}} with Michigan State, which were the road version of the uniform worn against Notre Dame. It {{was the first time}} that Michigan wore all white road uniforms since the 1976 Orange Bowl against Oklahoma. Michigan State also wore special alternate uniforms colored dark green, bronze and black.|$|E
5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} the X-Men and Brotherhood of Mutants uniting forces to save Professor X and Polaris. Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine meet up with Magneto, Mystique, and Sabretooth at a {{military}} prison outpost in Greenland to free Professor X. Upon freeing him, the teams relocate to the fictional mutant haven of Genosha. They find the island ravaged by Apocalypse's forces, and work through the wreckage {{and find out what}} he <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for.</b> They learn that Quicksilver was kidnapped by Apocalypse, who also kidnaps Beast from the X-Mansion. Beast manages to point the team {{in the direction of the}} Savage Land, a secret prehistoric preserve in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping {{to get to the bottom}} of the mystery.

5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether Hugh Devore, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} on the arduous journey {{south along the}} western slopes of the Maya Mountains, during which he lost most of his horses. The expedition became lost in the hills north of Lake Izabal and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, and crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for,</b> only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1525 the {{expedition}} {{arrived at the}} Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of {{the expedition}} had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for,</b> only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> a friend's contact {{information and the}} phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Widerøe {{introduced}} the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 {{on the route}} from Tromsø Airport to Hammerfest in 1983, {{the same year as}} Norving started flights from Hammerfest to Hasvik Airport. The Hasvik roue was taken over by Widerøe in 1990. Helikopter Service established a helicopter base at Hammerfest Airport in 1989 to serve the offshore petroleum industry which <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> oil in the Barents Sea. Widerøe {{introduced the}} Dash 8 on the Finnmark routes in 1995. The airport was taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. The state paid Hammerfest Municipality 19.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) in compensation. The routes eastwards were made subject to public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications from 1 April 1997. The routes to Tromsø had a sufficient patronage that they were operated without subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Master Chief and Cortana are {{the only}} {{survivors}} of their pod's crash landing, but they soon contact other survivors and help collect them into a fighting force. The survivors tell them that Keyes survived the Pillar of Autumns crash landing, but has been captured by the Covenant and is being held aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Master Chief and a force of Marines board the ship and rescue Keyes, who orders Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo's control center and to discover Halo's purpose. Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent Cartographer, which leads them to the control room. There, Cortana enters the systems and, discovering something urgent, suddenly sends Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind. Keyes <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> what he believed was a cache of powerful weapons, but when he reaches his position Master Chief finds only signs of a battle and a recording revealing they have accidentally released the Flood, a parasitic alien race capable of spreading itself by infesting other sentient life-forms.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell was {{subsequently}} posted to the British Army of the Rhine {{with the rest}} of the regiment, and then joined the King's African Rifles, and was posted to East Africa. Soon afterward, he saw action in Zanzibar with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the Northern Frontier District. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell <b>was</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for Idi Amin, who later became President of Uganda. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish clan system made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title King of Scotland.|$|E
