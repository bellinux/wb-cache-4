25|$|Literature on spatial crossmodal biases {{suggests}} that visual modality often influences information from other senses. Some {{research indicates that}} vision dominates <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear,</b> when varying the degree of spatial congruency. This {{is known as the}} ventriloquist effect. In cases of visual and haptic integration, children younger than 8 years of age show visual dominance when required to identify object orientation. However, haptic dominance occurs when the factor to identify is object size.|$|E
25|$|Even <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{both the}} on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, {{in combination with}} Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long shots or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. [...] "In effect," [...] Anderegg writes, [...] "Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear,</b> a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action." [...] During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots {{in the mud and}} the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene.|$|E
500|$|According to guitarist Huw Bunford {{the track}} had the working title [...] "Miami Vice" [...] as it {{featured}} a drum roll {{similar to one}} used in the theme tune to the 80's television show of the same name. The band decided not to keep this name as they were keen to avoid links with a particular place—Bunford gave {{the example of the}} song's use on a travel documentary about Miami as something the group did not want to see. Some promotional copies of Phantom Power featured [...] "Slow Life" [...] as the first track although it eventually appeared as the last track on the officially released version of the album. Gruff Rhys has stated that the song had to go at either the beginning or the end of the record as it is the [...] "most sonically impressive" [...] track on the album. Rhys has described his lyrics as [...] "regurgitating <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> on the news, recycled, vomiting them all back". The Guardian has interpreted the song as a [...] "cutting critique of middle-east colonialism".|$|E

2500|$|Jeffrey Overstreet {{adds that}} [...] "the scenes in which Chigurh stalks Moss are as suspenseful as {{anything}} the Coens have ever staged. And that {{has as much}} to do with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> as what we see. No Country for Old Men lacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from Jaws. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war. When the leather of a briefcase squeaks against the metal of a ventilation shaft, you'll cringe, and the distant echo of a telephone ringing in a hotel lobby will jangle your nerves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Plato’s Problem was {{expressed}} generally by Bertrand Russell: [...] "How comes it that human beings, whose {{contacts with the}} world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to {{know as much as}} they do know?" [...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E

"From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> of the village, {{there is}} little fear of that; the {{mischief}} must have begun before Mr. Thorndyke came down, when by all accounts things had altogether gone to the bad here, and of course young Bastow must have had an exceptionally evil disposition, Ernest." ...|$|E

50|$|One should add, however, that naïve realism {{does not}} claim that reality is only <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see, <b>hear</b> etc.. Likewise, {{scientific}} realism does not claim that reality is only {{what can be}} described by fundamental physics. It follows that the relevant distinction to make is not between naïve and scientific realism but between direct and indirect realism.|$|R

6000|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{himself that}} all was right below, Mr Stevenson returned aft and went on deck, where a sublime and awful sight awaited him. The waves appeared to be <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> sometimes termed [...] "mountains high."

All beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the ship was black and chaotic.|$|E

40|$|Shot on {{a mobile}} phone, Dark Glass {{visually}} recreates a spoken description of family photographs recalled under hypnosis.
