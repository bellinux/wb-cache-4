5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

25|$|Routledge says in {{her notes}} that a Rapanui elder {{told her that}} all the manu miro ('wood birds') were inscribed with glyphs. However, text X {{is the only one}} known (Fischer 1997).

However, other scholars have <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> inscription might have been added later.|$|E

25|$|Neanderthals {{inhabited}} much of Europe {{and western}} Asia {{from as far}} back as 130,000 years ago. They existed in Europe as late as 30,000 years ago. They were eventually replaced by anatomically modern humans (AMH; sometimes known as Cro-Magnons), who began to appear in Europe circa 40,000 years ago. Given that the two hominid species likely coexisted in Europe, anthropologists have long <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> two interacted. The question was resolved only in 2010, when it was established that Eurasian populations exhibit Neanderthal admixture, estimated at 1.5–2.1% on average. The question now became whether this admixture had taken place in Europe, or rather in the Levant, prior to AMH. migration into Europe.|$|E

The following year in April he played his first match in the County Championship; {{it was his}} second first-class match and he took his first five-wicket haul, helping Lancashire to a one-wicket win over Leicestershire. Hogg's relatives include grandfather Sonny Ramadhin and father Willie Hogg. He made a promising start to his career in 2001, at which time there were calls {{for him to be}} selected for the full England squad. But in season 2002–03, When team-mate James Anderson was selected by England in the 2002–03 season, some pundits <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> selectors had confused him with Hogg.

25|$|On January 20, 2001, President Clinton {{commuted}} {{the sentences}} of the men; Berger's sentence became two years, {{and the other}} men each had 30 months. Federal prosecutors investigated the pardons {{to see if they}} were made in exchange for political support. A 2001 ABC News article stated that some people <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> pardons occurred as a kind of favor because the Village of New Square had voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton for her first senate term (1359 out of 1369 votes – in contrast to two other Hasidic communities nearby who voted overwhelmingly republican) or if the pardons occurred as part of a quid pro quo swap for votes. Hillary Clinton said that she was not involved in the pardons and that her husband pardoned the men out of clemency. In 2002 the prosecutors closed the investigation with no action.|$|E
500|$|Police in Manchester {{were aware}} that their Metropolitan Police colleagues in London were {{investigating}} a suspected IRA unit based in the capital, and <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> London unit {{was responsible for the}} Manchester bombing. On 15 July, Metropolitan police arrested six men suspected of IRA membership: Donal Gannon, John Crawley, Gerard Hanratty, Robert Morrow, Patrick Martin, and Francis Rafferty. Each was tried and convicted of [...] "conspiracy to cause explosions at National Grid electricity stations", and sentenced to 35years in jail. Police in Manchester meanwhile worked to establish if the men were also responsible for the Manchester bomb.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Counterfeit" [...] story {{features}} the character Lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become Tessa's double. Lisa was played by Meilani Paul before the surgery and by Vandernoot after it. The producers <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> story needed {{to explain the}} change in Lisa's voice, as she would be played by a different actor. They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery, then decided that Lisa would have voice training. After her operation, Lisa speaks with Vandernoot's voice when posing as Tessa, and with Meilani Paul's voice when the character was not acting. This was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post-production.|$|E

500|$|Oral {{argument}} in Bakke {{took place on}} October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General Wade H. McCree for the United States. Colvin was admonished by Justice Byron White for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution. Cox provided {{one of the few}} moments of levity during the argument when Justice Harry A. Blackmun <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships. [...] Cox was willing to agree, but noted that he was a Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, [...] "I don't know whether it's our aim, but we don't do very well." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} some of {{the smaller}} additions useful and others gimmicky. Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing, but thought, for instance, that the vision camera integration added little to the game. While Electronic Gaming Monthly had wanted more development of the story, Mc Shea (GameSpot) was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game. [...] While Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that loading times had been improved, Geddes (IGN) considered them [...] "frustratingly long". Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) thought that Trouble in Paradise did a better job of introducing the player to the world by pre-loading player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial. He <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> game went too far, from too slow to hyperactive.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this {{in the form of}} his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his {{proposals}} for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's [...] "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells [...] "had minimal capacity for putting [...] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, [...] "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier: [...] "God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.|$|E

500|$|Before {{its debut}} in the United States, The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> series would do well, writing: [...] "soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might {{not be enough to}} hook Junior or the {{original}} Degrassi's older fans". The issues that the characters experience have often been commented on in the media. It has been noted that the series never attempts to hide from depicting honest accounts of the trials and tribulations that real teenagers may often experience. Sarah Liss from CBC News said that despite often being corny and soap opera-y, Degrassi: The Next Generation tackles issues that other genre series prefer to gloss over, and was part of her essential viewing. She named the series one of [...] "the [...] most important television shows of the 2000s", and was the only children's series, and the only Canadian television series, to appear on the list, which included Mad Men, Lost, the CSI franchise, and Sex and the City.|$|E
500|$|Kenshin's {{development}} in the Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection OVA series has received negative reviews by many publications. Anime News Network also adds that in Reflection he [...] "continues to be his old mopey self" [...] and criticizes {{the fact that he}} never says [...] "oro", while IGN felt that some moments of the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru were depressing. While criticizing the characters' sad decisions, Serdar Yegulalp from About.com <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> OVAs had to make viewers accept Kenshin's death wish after so much time of wandering and feeling a mortal disease. However, some reviewers noted Kenshin's personality in the OVAs {{was one of the most}} complex ever to be animated remarking on the fact that he can not forget his bloody past, despite having a peaceful life. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kenshin's family became. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe shared similar feelings, but noted Kenshin had no new enemies to fight after Enishi, leaving him with his disease story arc.|$|E
500|$|Demands for Patton to be {{relieved}} of duty and sent home {{were made in}} Congress and in newspapers across the country. U.S. Representative Jed Johnson of Oklahoma's 6th district described Patton's actions as a [...] "despicable incident" [...] and was [...] "amazed and chagrined" [...] Patton was still in command. He called for the general's immediate dismissal {{on the grounds that}} his actions rendered him no longer useful to the war effort. Representative Charles B. Hoeven of Iowa's 9th district said on the House floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by [...] "hard boiled officers". He <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Army had [...] "too much blood and guts." [...] Eisenhower submitted a report to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who presented it to Senator Robert R. Reynolds, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. The report laid out Eisenhower's response to the incident and gave details of Patton's decades of military service. Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate. Investigators Eisenhower sent to Patton's command found the general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops.|$|E
