In 1355, when Sir Edward de Letham acquired the <b>wardship</b> of the property, the site {{was described as a}} fortalice, a weakly defended location, but by 1368, when the <b>wardship</b> passed to Joan, his widow, it was considered to be a fully-fledged castle. De Letham was a powerful regional figure, and may have been granted the <b>wardship</b> by Edward III in order to retain his loyalty in the face of military advances by the Scots; he and his wife allegedly ran down the surrounding estate, resulting in a commission being established to investigate the abuses.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, Henry VI was {{released}} from the Tower and returned to the throne by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the <b>wardship</b> of the executed Earl of Worcester's heir and estates, {{as well as of the}} young Lord Clifford. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470.|$|E
5|$|He was {{pastor of}} the church of Calder Comitis, Midlothian, by September 1296. Both churches were {{indirectly}} under the patronage of the Bishop of St Andrews, William Fraser. The rector of Haddington was St Andrews Cathedral Priory and although the church of Calder Comitis was normally under the patronage of the Mormaer of Fife, {{at that point in time}} the <b>wardship</b> of the young mormaer's lands was being held by the Bishop of St Andrews.|$|E

Also in 1194 {{he was given}} custody {{of the town of}} Marlborough in Wiltshire, and in 1196 he was appointed as Sheriff of Oxfordshire. He was also named in 1197 as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire, offices he held until some time in 1200.|$|E
5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as <b>wardship</b> and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{received}} further favour {{from the}} Crown soon after, being granted the <b>wardship</b> {{of the son}} and heir of John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley, and, when that was taken back in 1409, he received estates in Shropshire and Cambridgeshire in compensation. Unusually ("striking", says Helen Castor) {{he was not a}} retainer of the crown or the Duchy of Lancaster, in Staffordshire, but rather of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, for whom Humphrey represented the interests of the main Stafford family.|$|E

50|$|Between April 1282 and December 1284 Edmund {{served as}} Edward I's {{lieutenant}} in the government whilst the king conducted a campaign in Wales, mediated {{the collection of the}} clerical subsidy towards the costs of the proposed crusade, ensured the exchequer rolls were transported to Shrewsbury, attended a clerical convocation in Northampton in January 1283 as the king's representative, as well as taking custody of <b>wardships</b> and estates on his personal account.|$|R
5|$|Ludlow Castle {{was in the}} <b>wardship</b> of King Henry IV, {{when the}} Owain Glyndŵr revolt broke out across Wales. Military captains were {{appointed}} to the castle {{to protect it from}} the rebel threat, in the first instance John Lovel and then Henry's half-brother, Sir Thomas Beaufort. Roger Mortimer's younger brother, Edmund, set out from the castle with an army against the rebels in 1402, but was captured at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry refused to ransom him, and he eventually married one of Glyndŵr's daughters, before dying during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409.|$|E
5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the <b>wardship</b> of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E
5|$|After his father's death, Braose {{continued}} to serve Edward. He contributed both money and personal military service in Edward's wars in Wales, Scotland, and France. He saw service in Gascony in 1294. In 1297 he {{took part in}} a military campaign in Flanders. As a reward for his service in Flanders, he received the <b>wardship</b> of John de Mowbray, who Braose eventually married to his daughter Aline. From 1298 to 1306 he was involved in the Scottish wars, and was at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. Besides the military service, he served the king in 1301 by signing a letter from the leading barons of England to Pope Boniface VIII in which the barons decried papal interference in the royal rights of England.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "feudal incidents" [...] were feudal {{rights of}} the king as the {{overlord}} of his tenants-in-chief, which included the claim to knight-service, the three regular feudal aids and payments of feudal relief on succession to a fief, {{as well as the}} profits from <b>wardships</b> and marriages, together with escheats forfeitures. The yields from these sources varied with the power of the king and were kept within bounds by the resistance of tenants as shown in the demands of Magna Carta(1215).|$|R
5000|$|The {{systems for}} the {{exploitation}} of royal feudal incidents fell into decay by the 15th century, but following the accession of King Henry VII (1485-1509) in 1485, {{and in order to}} replenish the royal treasury, a new importance was placed on fully exploiting such rights. Surveyors, commissioners and from 1514 county feodaries were appointed to actively search for and spy out potential royal <b>wardships,</b> and in each county there were established over wards retained by the king a master, receiver-general, auditor and particular receiver. Liberal rewards were paid to anyone providing information allowing the discovery of a new crown ward. Over all was appointed a [...] "Master of the King's Wards", to be held at the king's pleasure, first established in late 1503, to supervise royal <b>wardships</b> and administer the lands and revenues of wards during the period of crown control, and to sell those not to be retained. The revenues were paid to the Treasurer of the Chamber, that is to say the king's private funds, not into the Treasury.The master originally was required to declare his accounts orally to the king's own person four times a year, which in 1531 was altered to require the rendering of such accounts to general surveyors.|$|R
5|$|Edmund FitzAlan {{was born}} in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, {{daughter}} of Thomas I of Saluzzo in Italy. Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's <b>wardship</b> was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he had changed his mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E
5|$|In February 1334 Montagu {{was sent}} on a {{commission}} to Edinburgh, to demand Edward Balliol's homage to Edward. In the great summer campaign of 1335, it was Montagu who provided the largest English contingent, with 180 men-at-arms and 136 archers. He was well rewarded for his contributions: after the Scots {{had been forced to}} cede the Lowlands, Montagu was granted the county of Peeblesshire. He was also allowed to buy the <b>wardship</b> of Roger Mortimer's son Roger for 1000 marks, a deal {{that turned out to be}} very lucrative for Montagu. At this point, however, the fortunes were turning for the English in Scotland. Montagu campaigned in the north again in 1337, but the siege of Dunbar met with failure. Following the abortive attempt in Scotland, Edward III turned his attention to the continent.|$|E
5|$|John's father {{augmented}} the family's {{position by}} exploiting the favour of the King, Henry VI, {{to whom he}} was an important councillor in the 1440s. Already Earl of Suffolk, John's father was in turn elevated to a marquess (in 1444) and then Duke of Suffolk (1448), and with these titles received major grants from the crown. Also, it had been his father's receipt of the <b>wardship</b> of Margaret Beaufort from the king that enabled John's marriage to her, whilst both were still infants and despite them being within the prohibted degrees of consanguinity. Contemporaries claimed that the marriage to the daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (cousin of the-then childless king) was intended to make John de la Pole an eventual heir to the crown; this is considered unlikely by modern historians, who have pointed at indications that the King supported William in these plans. It {{has suggested that the}} marriage was the direct result of Willim's political difficulties during the 1450-1 parliament.|$|E
50|$|His {{part in the}} {{toppling}} of Cromwell in 1540 is too obscure, and {{may have}} been too small, to be given much weight. The fall of Cromwell did enable Throckmorton to acquire several properties which he had long coveted, including Oversley, and so to continue the consolidation of his estates which had been one of his principal concerns since his succession. Healso built up extensive leasehold interests and acquired several valuable <b>wardships,</b> including that of Richard Archer whose execution for murder gave Throckmorton the opportunity to buy from the crown his most valuable property, Tamworth.|$|R
50|$|While {{they were}} still children, {{she and her sister}} Anne were coheiresses to their father, mother and grandfather. Their <b>wardships</b> were sold in 1510 to Sir Ralph Bowes (d.1482) of Streatlam. Anne Aske married Ralph Bulmer., and in 1521 Elizabeth Aske was betrothed to her guardian's {{youngest}} son, Richard Bowes (c.1497-1558), to whom the King granted special livery of half the lands of William Aske, to be received at his marriage. Richard Bowes, like the rest of his family, was engaged in border business, but seems to have lived chiefly at Aske.|$|R
5000|$|Westmorland's new {{proximity}} to the royal family, and his loyalty to the Crown during the crisis of July 1397 led to his elevation to the peerage as Earl of Westmorland in 1397, and his family rose from knighthood to the nobility. Although King Richard had created Ralph as the first Earl of Westmorland, Ralph sided with Joan's half-brother Henry Bolingbroke when Bolingbroke deposed Richard in 1399 and assumed the throne as King Henry IV. Joan and Ralph were granted numerous offices, lands, <b>wardships</b> and pensions. They continued to enjoy royal favour until Henry IV's death in 1413.|$|R
5|$|Suffolk's {{connection}} with John of Gaunt was strong, a family connection that {{went back to}} the times of Suffolk's father. Suffolk's second wife Isabel had a daughter from a previous marriage, who was in Gaunt's <b>wardship.</b> This daughter, Elizabeth, who was an heiress of Lord Strange, was probably transferred to Isabel's household at her marriage to Suffolk. The two lords also maintained some of the same men as servants, or retainers. At the Good Parliament in 1376, Suffolk was elected to a committee that would discuss the parliament's grievances concerning the failed fiscal and military policies of Gaunt, who was the de facto ruler of England. In spite of his association with Gaunt, the parliament trusted Suffolk's neutrality and equality in such a position. After parliament disbanded, Suffolk attended a lavish dinner given by the House of Commons, where Gaunt was conspicuously absent.|$|E
5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, {{before he}} came of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not old enough to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in <b>wardship.</b> During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont {{came of age in}} around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the <b>wardship</b> of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E
5000|$|Blanche Parry's {{position}} at {{the centre of the}} Royal Court was fully recognized at the time. She was friends with her cousin Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley and worked with him. The Queen treated Blanche Parry as a baroness. Amongst the material rewards she received from Elizabeth were two <b>wardships</b> and she acquired lands in Herefordshire, Yorkshire and Wales. A meticulous lady, Blanche Parry commissioned the first known map of Llangorse Lake in 1584 to aid the deliberations in the court case in which she became involved. Lord Burghley supervised Blanche Parry's two Wills. His notes in his own handwriting survive for her first Will of 1578 [...] and he was supervisor for her Final Will of 1589.|$|R
50|$|For {{his support}} of the new King, Westmorland was rewarded with a {{lifetime}} appointment as Earl Marshal on 30 September 1399 (although he resigned the office in 1412), a lifetime grant of the honour of Richmond on 20 October (although the grant was not accompanied by a grant of the title Earl of Richmond), and several <b>wardships.</b> Before 4 December he {{was appointed to the}} King's council. In March 1401, Westmorland was one of the commissioners who conducted negotiations for a marriage between the King's eldest daughter, Blanche of England, and Louis, son of Rupert, King of the Romans, and in 1403 was made a Knight of the Garter, taking the place left vacant by the death of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York.|$|R
50|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Inner Temple in 1552-3 and later acted as Master of the Revels there. He was called to the Bar, and returned to Ireland to practice law. He became second Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1561. In 1566 he was appointed one of three members of the Council for the Government of Munster, but was accused of showing too much favour to Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. He sat on several Royal Commissions in the 1560s, to survey lands, determine disputed land titles, and to negotiate with the O'Reilly clan. In 1567 with the other senior judges he was named as one of the lessees of King's Inn. He had several <b>wardships,</b> including that of his niece Mary Wise.|$|R
5|$|The {{unity of}} Henry’s {{assemblage}} of domains was largely {{dependent on the}} ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage {{and the right of}} allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the <b>wardship</b> of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King’s death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an Angevin Empire as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.|$|E
25|$|In October 1425, when Ralph Neville died, he bequeathed the <b>wardship</b> of York to his widow, Joan Beaufort. By now the <b>wardship</b> {{was even}} more valuable, as Richard had {{inherited}} the Mortimer estates {{on the death of}} the Earl of March. These manors were concentrated in Wales, and in the Welsh borders around Ludlow.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and <b>wardships,</b> but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|R
2500|$|In 1258 at the Oxford Parliament the barons {{sought to}} {{preclude}} men of religion from entering into the fees of earls and barons and others without their will, whereby they lost forever their <b>wardships,</b> marriages, reliefs and escheats. In 1259 the Provisions of Westminster ordained that it {{shall not be}} lawful for men of religion to enter the fee of anyone without the license of the lord of whom the land is held. The provisions were first considered law, then not rigorously enforced depending on who had political sway: barons or king. Most of the provisions in Westminster were re-enacted by the Statute of Marlborough in 1267, but not the ones mentioned. From this it may be gathered that the clergy had been influential with the king who was enjoying power over the barons.|$|R
