5|$|Believing {{that the}} film had been cancelled, Kamal Amrohi, one of the scriptwriters {{who was also a}} director, planned to make a film on the same subject himself. <b>When</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> Asif, he agreed to shelve the project. Another {{unrelated}} film production based on the same stage play was Nandlal Jaswantlal's Anarkali, starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar, which became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1953.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to extradite Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him as he saw fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the strong desire to recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy of these states to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. <b>When</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E

Imran calls up Laila, who comes along, surprising Arjun. <b>When</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten the wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. <b>When</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
5|$|Abu Firas further {{reports that}} Husayn {{was offered the}} {{governorship}} of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 23 March the regiment, {{the first}} mounted force, began {{to cross the}} river. They were passing beyond the {{infantry}} forward troops by 07:30. Two troops from the 11th Squadron were dispatched {{to the east and}} another north-east. One troop, twenty men, encountered a force of sixty Turkish cavalry and charged them, armed only with rifles and bayonets. The troop killed twenty cavalrymen and captured seven, in exchange for the death of one man, the troop leader who had ordered the charge. The troop sent north had forced a machine-gun post covering the river to withdraw, but the gun and its crew were later captured by men from the 4th Squadron. While this move had been progressing, the troop of the 11th Squadron had been sent north from the crossing. At the same time the 3rd and 4th Squadrons galloped north to take the Turkish defenders at Ghoraniyeh from the rear. At 09:00 the leading troops, without loss, captured the first Turkish outpost with seventeen prisoners. One troop of the 3rd Squadron dismounted and captured two machine-gun posts overlooking the crossing, which allowed the rest of the squadron to drive off the remaining defenders. While the 3rd Squadron concentrated on the crossing the 4th Squadron was ordered to gallop and capture the village of Shunet Nimrin, but were unable to approach the village <b>when</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> heavy artillery fire. The day's battle cost the regiment one dead and two wounded. By that night the bridge at Ghoraniyeh was completed and the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division were crossing at Hajlah.|$|E
