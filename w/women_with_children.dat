5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable {{communication}} {{that if the}} British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E

25|$|For braver souls, {{impatient}} with efforts to abolish slavery within the law, {{there were always}} illegal methods. Slaves escaped independently; most often they were young males, as they could move more freely than <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children.</b> Free blacks and white supporters of abolition of slavery gradually organized a number of safe places and guides, creating the Underground Railroad to help slaves gain safety in Northern states. The many Indian trails and waterways of Maryland, {{and in particular the}} countless inlets of the Chesapeake Bay, afforded numerous ways to escape north by boat or land, with many people going to Pennsylvania as the nearest free state. Supporters would shelter refugees, and sometimes give them food and clothing.|$|E

Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy port and trade connections. Slaves worked in many jobs on the waterfront {{as well as on}} the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the free state of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children,</b> sued in court in freedom suits, and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{according}} to the financial research company NerdWallet, Laredo had the worst pay for women of any city in the United States, with a large gender gap: an average annual salary of $24,700 for women, compared to nearly $35,000 for men. The gender pay gap in Laredo increased 25 percent between 2007 and 2012. Only the wealthy city of Frisco in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, had a greater pay gap within Texas than did Laredo. According to census reports, Laredo has a 30 percent rate of poverty. Laredo households headed by <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> {{under the age of}} eighteen have a 51 percent poverty rate. By contrast, the San Jose, California, area, the heart of the tech industry, has an average pay of $56,000, ranking first nationally.|$|E
25|$|By 1943, it {{was common}} {{for the public to}} be subject to mass murder. In the Józefów Massacre, 1500 Jewish <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> and elderly only, were killed. The Gentile {{population}} of Polish metropolitan cities was targeted for enslavement in the łapanka actions, in which the detachments of SS, Wehrmacht and police rounded up civilians after cordoning off streets. Between 1942 and 1944 in Warsaw, approximately 400 Poles were captured in łapankas every day. Between 1943 and 1944, the extermination of citizens of the capital was conducted at the Warsaw concentration camp holding up to 40,000 victims. It is estimated that during the existence of the KL Warschau tens of thousands of civilians have been eliminated there, most of them from the city. Some estimates put the total at 200,000. Prisoners were shot in publicly announced executions of hostages, and died due to deplorable conditions in the camp, hunger and typhus epidemics. Historians including Maria Trzcińska postulated the existence of a gas chamber in a railway tunnel at Bema Street; however, this claim is considered controversial.|$|E

500|$|Wilson College is a private, Presbyterian-related, {{liberal arts}} women's college founded in 1869 and {{named for its}} first major donor, Sarah Wilson of Chambersburg. [...] The college has 800 {{students}} and {{is known for its}} <b>Women</b> <b>With</b> <b>Children,</b> Veterinary Medical Technician, and Equestrian programs. [...] Once an all women's school, it currently is co-education. [...] In 2009, the school opened the first [...] "green" [...] campus building in Chambersburg, PA.

[...] The waterfall begins on the third floor and ends {{in the basement of the}} building.|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{response}} to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce [...] "total war", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> exempted from conscription, {{even if they had}} child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the [...] "extermination" [...] of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.|$|E

500|$|Stevenson {{considered}} housing, uniforms, and recruit {{training to}} be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No.1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was [...] "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942, {{which was to be}} the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, [...] "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." [...] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson [...] "did the most pertinent pioneering work" [...] in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director [...] "a difficult job and often a lonely one".|$|E
