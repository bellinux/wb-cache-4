The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> that issue. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E
500|$|By now, Rogers {{has learned}} Astaire's true {{identity}} although {{neither of them}} yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: [...] "Let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him," [...] which serves as the cue for the music of [...] "The Piccolino", the film's big production number. A gondola parade {{is followed by the}} entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choroeographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of [...] "The Carioca" [...] from Flying Down to Rio (1933) and [...] "The Continental" [...] from The Gay Divorcee (1934), and the lyric communicates its fake origin: [...] "It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in Brooklyn/and gazed at the stars." [...] It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, Busby Berkeley-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance, all shot in one take, with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment. They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting out {{to the side of the}} body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody's final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.|$|E

While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated: [...] "We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> all contingencies, and unless {{we are prepared to}} face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defense methods and a well-equipped army, navy and air force." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} global generating {{functions of}} the initial and of the evolution Lagrangian sub- manifolds related to a Hamiltonian flow. These global parameterizations are realized by means of Amann– Conley–Zehnder reduction. In some cases, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> generating functions that are weakly quadratic at infinity; more precisely, degeneracy points can occurs. Therefore, we develop a theory which allows us to treat possibly degenerate cases in order to define a Chaperon–Sikorav–Viterbo weak solution of a time- dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a Cauchy condition given at time t = T (T > 0). The starting motivation is to study some aspects of Mayer problems in optimal control theory...|$|R

40|$|Care of the {{paediatric}} population {{in a rural}} area like Hambantota was a challenge. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> several hardships due to poor infrastructure of the health system, financial constraints preventing people from continuing care of their sick children and natural disasters occurring frequently in this area diverting attention away from health care. The paediatric unit and special care baby unit (SCBU) functioned with several shortcomings. As the hospital is governed by a provincial council, it was not easy to fulfil even a minor requirement. Though we strived to overcome the hardships in this setup, it was mostly in vain. SCBU did not even have a glucometer or separate stethoscopes to examine premature babies. In many instances life-saving equipment did not work. Although the area was endemic for mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever and encephalitis, there were only three mosquito nets to cater to a 45 -bed paediatric ward. As the health care system of this provincial setup was badly affected by frequent trade union action, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> several problems in treating patients such as lack of drugs, inability to do investigations, cancellations of clinics and lack of transport facilities to transfer critically ill patients to nearby intensive care units.
