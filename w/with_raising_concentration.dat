40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} morphological {{changes of}} breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 following the development of acquired resistance towards cisplatin. Resistance towards anticancer agents still {{plays an important role}} in the breast cancer chemotherapy failure. Methods: The cisplatin resistant subline MCF- 7 /CisR was developed in-vitro by cultivating the parental cell line cisplatin-sensitive MCF- 7 <b>with</b> <b>raising</b> <b>concentration</b> of cisplatin (from 0. 01 to 2. 3 µM) for four months. The cell morphology was observed by giemsa staining. Results: The resistance was shown by the increase of IC 50 by 9 folds on MCF- 7 /CisR compared to the initial IC 50 value of MCF- 7. The change in cisplatin cytotoxic potency on the resistant cell line was accompanied by the morphological modification, including the enlargement of cell size, the increase of nucleus and cytoplasm ratio, and the increase of the number of microvesicular and cytoplasmic granules. Conclusions: This result has supported the underlying mechanism of cisplatin resistance, including the ability of the cells to decrease intracellular cisplatin concentration and repair DNA damage effects...|$|E
40|$|Static light {{scattering}} and electric birefringence measurements on aqueous solutions of charged poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) with different molecular weights between 105 and 1. 1 × 106  g/mol are presented. All experiments were {{performed in the}} dilute and the semidilute concentration regime (0. 0005  mg/ml < c < 10  mg/ml) at minimum ionic strength (down to ≈ 10 - 6 M). The static {{light scattering}} experiments show a single broad peak in the scattered intensity. The scattering vectors of these peaks increase with increasing concentrations c and scale either with c 1 / 3 or with c 1 / 2 only depending on a relative concentration {{but not on the}} molecular weight : below about 20  c* (1  c* := overlap concentration of extended chains = 1 particle/(contour length ℓc) 3) we found a c 1 / 3 dependence of the scattering vector, above 20  c* a c 1 / 2 law is valid. A similar behaviour has been observed for rigid rods [1]. Our results are compared with previous light-[2, 3], small angle neutron-[4, 5], and small angle X-ray [6] scattering investigations. Nearly all of these studies are in a very good agreement with the c 1 / 3 -and c 1 / 2 -law. The relaxation of the electric birefringence signal after an applied rectangular electric field is monoexponential in nearly all cases. Again the concentration 20  c*, independent of the molecular weight, seems to be a critical concentration : below 20  c* we found a normal (negative) birefringence signal, above an anomal (positive) signal. These results are compared with results of electric birefringence measurements on aqueous solutions of rigid rods [7, 8] and PSS- at different ionic strengths [9 - 11]. It is claimed that our results can be explained by a small flexibility of strongly elongated PSS–rods which increases slightly with increasing molecular weight and distinctly <b>with</b> <b>raising</b> <b>concentration.</b> The concentration c* is shown to be a reasonable quantity to describe polyelectrolyte solutions without added salt, independent of the molecular weight, respectively the contour length. By rescaling comparable data published by other authors we can establish the critical concentration 20  c*, which seems to be universally valid...|$|E
40|$|Spray {{planting}} engineering {{method has}} been applied for more than thirty years. The spray planting apparatus and materials have been continuously ameliorated and invented. In this study, Polisoil {{was chosen as the}} tested specimen. Five different concentrations of polisoil (0 %, 1. 63 %, 2. 13 %, 2. 63 %, 3. 13 %) were sprayed on laterite, and Bermuda grass and Taiwan Acacia were chosen as the experimental plants. The rainfall simulator was applied to measure the soil erosion under different concentration treatments. The germination rate of Bermuda grass and Taiwan Acacia of Polisoil with different polisoil concentration treatments was also measured. The soil properties of different treatments were measured also. The results are summarized as following: 1. The pH, mean diameter of aggregates and water holding capacity of laterite will increase with the raising concentration of Polisoil, however, the saturated hydraulic conductivity did not change significantly. 2. The erosion of laterite, the germination percentage and the germination potential of plants will decrease <b>with</b> <b>raising</b> <b>concentration</b> of Polisoil. The best concentration of Polisoil was found to be 2. 13 %, which will control the soil erosion and will not inhibit the seed germination. 噴植工法之引進與應用迄今有近三十年，目前噴植機具與噴植材料仍持續在改良與研發中。本研究選取土壤團粒化劑為試驗材料，調配 1. 63 ％、 2. 13 ％、 2. 63 ％、 3. 13 ％與對照組 0 ％等五種濃度配比，並以百慕達草、相思樹為供試植物，進行噴附後之土壤物理、沖蝕與種子發芽試驗，探討不同濃度的土壤團粒化劑對紅土保護功效與植物初期生長影響，期能提供此工法於施工設計與種子材料應用之參考。茲將結果摘要如下： 1. 土壤團粒化劑施用於紅土，噴附濃度愈高，土壤pH值、幾何平均粒徑隨之增大，且於低基質張力（ 0 ∼ 2 bar）時，保水性亦提高，但對飽和水力傳導度無顯著影響。 2. 經種子發芽與模擬降雨沖蝕試驗得知，土壤團粒化劑濃度越高，則紅土抗沖蝕性愈佳，種子發芽率與發芽勢愈低。土壤團粒化劑噴植於B處理（ 2. 13 ％）下，對於紅土沖蝕控制與植物種子發芽情形均能達到其成效，應屬較佳之施工濃度配比。對於土壤沖蝕嚴重之地區可選擇大於B處理之濃度，以發揮較高之抗沖蝕能力；反之，需快速達到綠化植生地區可選擇低於B處理之濃度，以加速種子之發芽。目 錄 頁次 中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅱ 圖次…………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 表次…………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅳ 壹、前言………………………………………………………………… [...] 1 貳、前人研究…………………………………………………………… [...] 3 一、噴植之相關研究……………………………………………… [...] 3 （一）噴植方法之發展……………………………… [...] ………… 3 （二）噴植材料……………………… [...] . …………………………. 5 二、紅土之相關研究……………………… [...] . ……………………… 6 三、土壤物理性質之相關研究……………. …. ……………… [...] … 8 （一）土壤團粒穩定…………………. …. ……………………. … 8 （二）土壤滲透………………. …. ……. …. ……………………… 10 （三）土壤保水能力…………. ……. …. ………. ………. … [...] . …… 11 四、土壤沖蝕之相關研究………………. …. …. ……………… [...] 11 參、試驗材料、項目與方法………………………………………… [...] . 13 一、研究流程…………………………………………………. …… [...] . 13 二、試驗材料……………………………………………………… [...] 14 （一）供試土壤…………………………………………………… 14 （二）土壤團粒化劑………… [...] ………………………. ……… [...] 16 （三）試驗種子材料………… [...] ………………………. ……… [...] 19 三、試驗項目與方法……………………… [...] …………………… [...] … 21 （一） 土壤物理試驗…………………………………………… [...] 21 1. 土壤pH值測定…………………………………………… [...] 21 2. 團粒穩定濕篩分析試驗…………………………………… 22 3. 飽和水力傳導度試驗……………………………………… 23 4. 土壤水分特性測定………………………………………… 25 （二） 種子發芽試驗………… [...] ………………………………… 28 （三） 土壤抗沖蝕性試驗………… [...] ………… [...] ……………… [...] 29 （四） 資料分析與簡易模式建立………………… [...] … [...] ……… [...] 32 肆、結果與討論……………………………………………………… [...] 34 一、土壤物理試驗………………………………………………… [...] 34 （一） 土壤pH值………………………………………………… [...] 34 （二） 土壤團粒穩定性………………………………………… [...] . 35 （三） 飽和水力傳導度………… [...] . ……………………………… 36 （四） 土壤水分特性測定結果…………………………… [...] . … [...] . 39 二、發芽試驗結果…………………………………… [...] …………… [...] 41 （一）供試植物發芽率…………………………………………… 41 （二）供試植物之發芽勢………………………………………… 50 三、土壤抗蝕性試驗………………………………………………… 52 伍、結論與建議……………………………………………………… [...] . 56 一、結論……………………………………………………………… 56 二、建議…………………………………………………………… [...] 58 陸、參考文獻………………………………………………………… [...] . 5...|$|E
40|$|This article {{sets out}} the {{clinical}} {{context of the}} research presented by Romero-Corral et al. in an accompanying article in this journal. Obesity is an important risk factor {{for the development of}} cardiovascular disease. Among other metabolic abnormalities, obesity is associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) and of leptin. Here, we discuss the study carried out by Romero-Corral and colleagues an analysis of leptin, CRP and cardiovascular risk factors. These researchers found that <b>raised</b> leptin <b>concentrations</b> were a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than CRP; the highest risk was observed in participants <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of both markers. We explore the possible mechanism for this interaction, and propose that leptins stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system and its ability to impair baroreceptor control might be involved...|$|R

METHODS: The RF isotype profiles were determined in 59 patients with LD; erythema migrans (EM) (n= 19), neuroborreliosis (NB) (n= 20) and Lyme arthritis (LA) (n= 20). Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) G 6 and G 8 (V(H) 1 gene associated), D 12 (V(H) 3 gene associated) and C 7 (V(kappa) III gene associated) were then {{used to determine the}} RF associated CRI expression on IgM antibodies in 16 of these LD patients (eight seropositive for RF); (EM (n= 3), NB (n= 6), LA (n= 7)). RESULTS: Seven (18 %) patients with either NB or LA had increased concentrations of IgA RF compared with none with EM. Significant differences in the number of patients <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of IgG RF or IgM RF were not found between the LD patient groups. Five (3 NB, 1 LA and 1 EM) (31 %) and three (2 NB and 1 LA) (19 %) of LD patients had <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the CRIs recognised by mAbs G 6 and G 8, respectively. These CRIs were detected in LD sera both <b>with</b> and without <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of RF and were not demonstrated on anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies using ELISA. No LD sera tested had <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the determinants recognised by mAbs C 7 or D 12. CONCLUSION: Significantly <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of IgA RF and increased use of V(H) 1 germline gene associated CRIs are found on IgM antibodies in the serum of LD patients.

At the same time blood was sampled for determination of serum S- 100 protein concentration. Patients were divided into three groups according to the aetiology of their CNS disease (intracranial haemorrhage, n= 11; benign intracranial mass lesion, n= 52; malignant neoplastic disease, n= 28). Radiological and intraoperative characteristics were documented.  RESULTS—In each of these three groups median values of all four CSF variables measured were raised. The occurrence of brain oedema and a midline shift correlated significantly <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of MBP and Qalb. Breaching of the arachnoid layer, documented at surgery for benign lesions, correlated with higher concentrations of MBP, lactate, CSF S- 100 protein, and Qalb.  CONCLUSIONS—Intraoperative values of S- 100 protein, MBP, lactate, and Qalb are increased in patients with intracranial haemorrhage, benign intracranial mass lesion, and malignant neoplastic disease. Breaching of the arachnoid layer and oedema is associated with higher concentrations of some of the aforementioned proteins.

Compatible with a central role for eosinophils and mast cells in asthma, sputum of asthmatic subjects contained increased numbers of eosinophils and levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and mast cell tryptase. Eosinophil numbers, and ECP and histamine levels correlated with the degree of methacholine airways responsiveness, and ECP, tryptase, and histamine correlated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of albumin. Using the micro-Boyden chamber technique eosinophil chemotactic activity was identified only in the sputum from asthmatics. The correlation between the raised levels of total IgA, IL- 8 /IgA complexes, and tryptase {{and the degree of}} sputum eosinophilia and ECP levels, suggests possible mechanisms for eosinophil chemotaxis and activation in asthma. Row cytometric analysis of sputum lymphocytes showed an increase in CD 4 + T cells and T cells expressing intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) in asthma which, together with the finding of raised levels of soluble ICAM- 1 in the sputum, indicates upregulation of this adhesion molecule. Finally, the proportion of CD 16 + natural killer (NK) cells was reduced in the sputum of asthmatics. These observations highlight the importance of the airway inflammation in causing asthma and further confirm the usefulness of sputum induction as a tool in asthma research. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The beta-chymase mouse mast cell protease- 1 (mMCP- 1) {{is generally considered}} to be expressed late in the in vitro differentiation of mast cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the kinetics of mMCP- 1 transcription and expression in vivo during nematode-induced IMMC hyperplasia. Concentrations of mMCP- 1 in blood and jejunum of BALB/c mice were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and at various stages after infection with the intestinal nematode Nippostronglyus brasilliensis. Mature mMCP- 1 enzyme was detected in jejunal homogenate (194 ng/mg soluble protein) and in blood (8. 3 ng/ml serum) from normal uninfected BALB/c mice. Maximal IMMC hyperplasia occurred 7 - 14 days post infection and was significantly correlated with increased levels of mMCP- 1 in jejunum (r = 0. 58, P < 0. 001) and <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of mMCP- 1 in serum (r = 0. 66, P < 0. 001).

DESIGN [...] Population based cross sectional study. SETTING [...] General practices in Merton, Sutton, and Wandsworth. SUBJECTS [...] A random sample of 388 men aged 50 - 69 years from general practice registers. 612 men were invited to attend and 413 attended, of whom 25 non-white men were excluded. The first 303 of the remaining 388 men had full risk factor profiles determined.

Coronary heart disease was sought by the Rose angina questionnaire and Minnesota coded electrocardiograms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Serum C reactive protein concentrations, cardiovascular risk factor levels, and the presence of coronary heart disease. RESULTS [...] Increasing age, smoking, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections, and body mass index were all associated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of C reactive protein. C Reactive protein <b>concentration</b> was associated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> serum fibrinogen, sialic acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and apolipoprotein B values.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{effects of}} iron {{interventions}} and host iron status on infection risk {{have been a}} recurrent clinical concern, {{although there has been}} little research on this interaction in pregnant women. METHODS Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were undertaken to determine the association of whole blood zinc erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ZPP) with malaria parasitaemia in pregnant women attending antenatal and delivery care at Montfort and Chikwawa Hospitals, Shire Valley, Malawi. Prevalence of antenatal, delivery and placental malaria was assessed in relation to maternal ZPP levels. The main outcome measures were prevalence of peripheral and placental Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia and odds ratios of malaria risk. RESULTS A total of 4, 103 women were evaluated at first antenatal visit, of whom at delivery 1327 were screened for peripheral and 1285 for placental parasitaemia. Risk of malaria at delivery (peripheral or placental) was higher in primigravidae (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and lower (peripheral) with use of intermittent preventive anti-malarials during pregnancy (p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Gastric {{duplication}} cyst (GDC) in {{an adult}} can have several clinical presentations. A {{review of the literature}} showed previously reported cases of GDC presenting as pancreatic pseudocyst or <b>with</b> greatly <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9). It is often difficult to discriminate GDC from pancreatic cystic tumour, in particular pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma, in which concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19 - 9 are classically raised. This report describes an adult case of GDC mimicking a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas. This is the first report of a simultaneous increase in carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19 - 9 in GDC in the absence of malignancy. Although few cases of carcinoma arising from a GDC having been reported, the production of oncofetal antigens raises the problem of a precancerous condition in long standing intestinal duplications. In this situation surgical resection must be performed...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{population}} studies, high intakes {{of coffee}} are associated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of plasma homocysteine, {{a predictor of}} risk of cardiovascular disease. Chlorogenic acid is a major polyphenol in coffee; coffee drinkers consume up to I g chlorogenic acid/d. Objective: We studied whether chlorogenic acid affects plasma total homocysteine concentrations in humans. For comparison we also studied the effects of black tea rich in polyphenols and of quercetin- 3 -rutinoside, a major flavonol in tea and apples. Design: In this crossover study, 20 healthy men and women ingested 2 g (5. 5 mmol) chlorogenic acid, 4 g black tea solids containing ≈ 4. 3 mmol polyphenols and comparable to ≈ 2 L strong black tea, 440 mg (0. 7 mmol) quercetin- 3 -rutinoside, or a placebo daily. Each subject received each of the 4 treatments for 7 d, in random order. Results: Total homocysteine in plasma collected 4 - 5 h after supplement intake was 12 % (1. 2 μmol/L; 95 % CI: 0. 6, 1. 7) higher after chlorogenic acid and 11 % (1. 1 μmol/L; 95 % CI: 0. 6, 1. 5) higher alter black tea than after placebo. Total homocysteine in fasting plasma collected 20 h after supplement intake was 4 % (0. 4 μmol/L; 95 % CI: 0. 0, 0. 8) higher after chlorogenic acid and 5 % (0. 5 μmol/L; 95 % CI: 0. 0, 0. 9) higher after black tea than alter placebo. Quercetin- 3 -rutinoside did not significantly affect homocysteine concentrations. Conclusions: Chlorogenic acid, a compound in coffee, and black tea <b>raise</b> total homocysteine <b>concentrations</b> in plasma. Chlorogenic acid could be {{partly responsible for the}} higher homocysteine concentrations observed in coffee drinkers. Whether these effects on homocysteine influence cardiovascular disease risk remains to be established...|$|R

40|$|In some {{conditions}} e. g. osteoporosis, {{hypertension and}} hypercholesterolaemia, certain phenomena precede {{manifestation of the}} disease and preventive measures can be taken long before the disease presents itself. In the same way systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis can be explored. Recently, studies have been published on healthy blood donors, who later developed SLE or rheumatoid arthritis, and in whom specific autoantibodies could be demonstrated. In SLE the autoantibodies are not specific enough to develop preventive strategies, but in rheumatoid arthritis in particular there are specific antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP-antibodies) which are very specific. A clinical trial has been initiated in which HLA-DR 4 -positive people <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> autoantibody <b>concentrations</b> are given 1 - 2 intramuscular injections of dexamethasone with the aim of halving the antibody concentration and in the long term lowering the incidence of rheumatoid arthriti...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} iron {{interventions}} and host iron status on infection risk {{have been a}} recurrent clinical concern, {{although there has been}} little research on this interaction in pregnant women. Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were undertaken to determine the association of whole blood zinc erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ZPP) with malaria parasitaemia in pregnant women attending antenatal and delivery care at Montfort and Chikwawa Hospitals, Shire Valley, Malawi. Prevalence of antenatal, delivery and placental malaria was assessed in relation to maternal ZPP levels. The main outcome measures were prevalence of peripheral and placental Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia and odds ratios of malaria risk. Results: A total of 4, 103 women were evaluated at first antenatal visit, of whom at delivery 1327 were screened for peripheral and 1285 for placental parasitaemia. Risk of malaria at delivery (peripheral or placental) was higher in primigravidae (p < 0. 001), and lower (peripheral) with use of intermittent preventive anti-malarials during pregnancy (p < 0. 001). HIV infection was associated with increased malaria parasitaemia (p < 0. 02, peripheral or placental). Parasitaemia prevalence was lower in women with normal ZPP levels compared to those <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> at both first antenatal visit (all gravidae, p = 0. 048, and at delivery (all gravidae, p < 0. 001; primigravidae, p = 0. 056). Between first antenatal visit and delivery women who transitioned from raised (at first antenatal visit) to normal ZPP values (at delivery) had lower peripheral parasitaemia prevalence at delivery compared to those who maintained normal ZPP values at both these visits (all gravidae: 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 1. 1; primigravidae: 0. 3, 0. 1 - 0. 8). In regression analysis this difference was lost with inclusion of HIV infection in the model. Conclusions: <b>Raised</b> ZPP <b>concentrations</b> in pregnancy were positively associated with P. falciparum parasitaemia and were probably secondary to malaria inflammation, rather than indicating an increased malaria risk with iron deficiency. It was not possible from ZPP measurements alone to determine whether iron deficiency or repletion alters malaria susceptibility in pregnanc...|$|R
40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight IgM, the monomeric subunit of pentameric IgM, was clearly detected by immunoblotting and filtration chromatographic techniques in six patients with juvenile chronic arthritis and in trace quantities in a further eight of 24 patients studied. This low {{molecular weight}} IgM moiety contributed up to 33 % of the total circulating IgM and was strongly associated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> serum <b>concentrations</b> of IgM {{and the presence of}} antinuclear antibodies, extractable antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. Immunoblot analysis of positive serum samples showed small quantities of other {{low molecular weight}} oligomers of IgM in addition to monomeric IgM. It is postulated that the presence of low molecular weight IgM in the serum of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis reflects a disorder of the intracellular assembly of IgM subunits during a stimulated IgM immune response. The pathogenetic role of low molecular weight IgM remains uncertain...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of serial study of C reactive protein {{in the early}} detection of neonatal septicaemia was evaluated in a neonatal unit using a commercially available latex agglutination slide test as a rapid screening method and electroimmunoassay as a reference method for C reactive protein determination. A positive latex test was obtained in 11 infants with verified septicaemia (positive blood culture), two infants with clinically evident infection but without bacteriological confirmation, one infant with recurrent chest infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one infant who showed signs of birth asphyxia with meconium aspiration, but was not infected. Positive latex test results correlated <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of C reactive protein, measured by immunoassay. In some instances, however, concentrations of C reactive protein in excess of 12 mg/ 100 ml gave weaker agglutination results in the slide test, which {{could be interpreted as}} negative results. In a sequential study of the infected infants, 6. 3 % of the values recorded on a slide test were false negatives. In contrast, false positive values were observed on a slide test in 1. 9 % of 27 non-infected infants. The higher percentage of false negative values {{may be due to the}} presence of excess antigen in the sera of some infected children. It is suggested that the latex test should be carried out on suitable dilutions of serum. Although the slide test may reliably indicate infection at an early stage in neonates, the C reactive protein response is non-specific, as seen in a non-infected infant who showed signs of birth asphyxia with meconium aspiration. Provided the non-specific nature of the C reactive protein response is recognised, the latex test may be a useful serum measurement for early diagnosis of neonatal septicaemia of the newborn. The test has the advantage of being performed easily, quickly, and cheaply...|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} a common {{malignancy}} in men and the worldwide burden of this disease is rising. Lifestyle modifi cations such as smoking cessation, exercise, and weight control off er opportunities {{to reduce the risk}} of developing prostate cancer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To measure plasma {{interferon}} γ, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1), and interleukin 6  and {{to assess}} their correlation with cardiac troponin T in unstable angina.  DESIGN—Blood sampling in patients undergoing coronary arteriography for known or suspected ischaemic heart disease.  PATIENTS— 76 patients divided in three groups: 29  with unstable angina (group 1), 28  with stable angina (group 2), and 19  without ischaemic heart disease and with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 3).  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Plasma interleukin 6, interferon γ, MCP- 1, and troponin T in the three groups of patients.  RESULTS—Interleukin 6  was increased in group 1  (median 2. 19  (range 0. 53 - 50. 84)  pg/ml) compared with the control group (1. 62  (0. 79 - 3. 98) pg/ml) (p <  0. 005), whereas interferon γ was higher in group 1  (range 0 - 5. 51  pg/ml) than {{in the other two}} groups (range 0 - 0. 74 pg/ml and 0 - 0. 37  pg/ml; p <  0. 005 and p <  0. 001, respectively). Patients with unstable angina (group 1) and positive troponin T had higher concentrations of interferon γ than those with negative troponin T (0 - 5. 51  pg/ml v 0 - 0. 60  pg/ml, p <  0. 001). Plasma MCP- 1 was also higher in group 1  (median 267  (range 6 - 8670)  pg/ml) than in the other two groups (134  (19 - 890)  pg/ml and 84. 5  (5 - 325)  pg/ml; p <  0. 005 and p <  0. 001, respectively), and among group 1  patients with a positive troponin T assay than in those with normal troponin T (531  (14. 5 - 8670)  pg/ml v 69  (6 - 3333)  pg/ml; p <  0. 01). There was no difference in plasma interleukin 6  in group 1  patients between those <b>with</b> and without <b>raised</b> troponin T.  CONCLUSIONS—The inflammatory cytokines interferon γ and MCP- 1 are increased in patients with unstable angina, particularly in those <b>with</b> <b>raised</b> <b>concentrations</b> of troponin T, suggesting that they are probably related to myocardial cell damage or to plaque rupture and thrombus formation.    Keywords: inflammatory cytokines; troponin T; unstable angin...|$|R
