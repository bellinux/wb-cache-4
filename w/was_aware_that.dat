5|$|Despite his {{military}} supremacy over land, Simeon I <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he needed naval assistance {{in order to}} seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> your hand <b>is</b> resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.|$|R

He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he might lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Hawke asked Sir Home Gordon, a cricket {{writer who}} had {{assisted}} Hawke with his autobiography, {{to sound out}} other counties {{to see if they}} would find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur—some players switched from amateur to professional, or vice versa, around this time. Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team, but <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for Lupton.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi {{from the mainland}} to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No.489 Squadron {{conducted}} a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in Stong Fjord. Continuing north, they were surprised to find a Narvik-class destroyer accompanied by a minesweeper and two flak ships in Førde Fjord. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near Bremanger. Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Z33 was in the area from Ultra signals intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|Stalin <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Americans {{were working}} on the atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly.

One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E

Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which {{had been such a}} success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, he <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E

There was a great urgency in coming up with a good escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.|$|E
5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the handwriting is typical for the 6th century, but the handwriting of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, {{and could not}} have been written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, {{the manuscript}} {{could not have been}} written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century.|$|E

Yonekura <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern {{was not to be}} caught in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{heavy water}} {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad {{had not been}} aware of the connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. Ramet and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet until 1 March 1909, when she was {{withdrawn}} {{for use as a}} torpedo training ship. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was again placed in active service with the cruiser division in the Baltic Sea. In October 1914, Friedrich Carl was the first German warship to carry seaplanes. The ship carried two planes provisionally and had no permanent modifications made to support them. She was made the flagship of Rear Admiral Behring, the commander of the German cruiser squadron in the Baltic Sea. The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. The German naval command <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> British submarines were operating in the Baltic Sea, and so ordered Behring to attack the Russian port at Libau to prevent it from being used as a British submarine base.|$|E
