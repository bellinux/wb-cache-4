25|$|The red hue was abandoned, as {{when viewed}} on {{television}} sets it made Nimoy look dark skinned. The makeup artists tried a yellow hue instead, which lightened Nimoy {{on television and}} {{it was agreed that}} this was an improvement. Meanwhile, Chambers re-created an ear mould as the ones created earlier for Nimoy were damaged. These new moulds would be the basis of the well known Spock ears. Each time Nimoy wore the ears, they were glued into place and could only be removed <b>with</b> <b>solvent.</b> But the ears were damaged in their removal, and so each pair could only be worn once.|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> insoluble polymers.|$|E
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), they can act as emulsifiers that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve. This occurs because the insoluble species {{can be incorporated into}} the micelle core, which is itself solubilized in the bulk solvent by virtue of the head groups' favorable interactions <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> species. The most common example of this phenomenon is detergents, which clean poorly soluble lipophilic material (such as oils and waxes) that cannot be removed by water alone. Detergents clean also by lowering the surface tension of water, making it easier to remove material from a surface. The emulsifying property of surfactants is also the basis for emulsion polymerization.|$|E

This study was conducted on 20 female rats of 3 months. Twenty rats included into the study were divided into 2 groups, each comprising 10 rats.

6000|$|... 292. This {{change in}} the {{structure}} of existing rocks is traceable through continuous gradations, so that a black mud or calcareous slime is imperceptibly modified into a magnificently hard and crystalline substance, inclosing nests of beryl, topaz, and sapphire, and veined with gold. But it cannot be determined how far, or in what localities, these changes are yet arrested; in the plurality of instances they are evidently yet in progress. It appears rational to suppose that as each rock approaches to its perfect type the change becomes slower; its perfection being continually neared, but never reached; its change being liable also to interruption or reversal by new geological phenomena. In the process of this change, rocks expand or contract; and, in portions, their multitudinous fissures give them a ductility or viscosity like that of glacier-ice on a larger scale. So that many formations are best to be conceived as glaciers, or frozen fields of crag, whose depth is to be measured in miles instead of fathoms, whose crevasses are filled <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> flame, with vapor, with gelatinous flint, or with crystallizing elements of mingled natures; the whole mass changing its dimensions and flowing into new channels, though by gradations which cannot be measured, and in periods of time of which human life forms no appreciable unit.|$|E
