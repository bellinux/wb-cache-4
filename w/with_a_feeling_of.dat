5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled his work <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form {{to express his}} political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E

His mother, Eliza Jane, {{daughter}} of Captain Basil Hall, RN, died before he was a year old; his grandmother brought him up in France. Chamberlain's poor health frequently led him to {{being sent to the}} warmer climates of Spain and Italy for the winter. This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships and left him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> rootlessness, of not belonging anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} limbic system begin to function. The limbic system is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> contentedness. Further development of the limbic system might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E

They came to him during inward prayer and contemplation, and were associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> indescribable joy, {{as well as the}} intellectual understanding that the light was a vision of God. In his writings, he spoke directly to God about the experience variously as [...] "the pure Light of your face" [...] and [...] "You deigned to reveal Your face to me like a formless sun." [...] He also described the light as the grace of God, and taught that its experience was associated with a mind that was completely still and had transcended itself. At times he described the light speaking to him with kindness, and explaining who it was.|$|E
500|$|Alonso Duralde {{wrote that}} the film should please slasher fans, but that it added nothing new to the genre or the {{franchise}} and would not appeal to {{people who did not}} like slasher films. Duralde criticized the film for adding a black and an Asian character in an attempt to [...] "update the movie for the new millennium". He also said the prospect of another Friday the 13thcrafted by the film's [...] "sequel-friendly" [...] endingdid not leave him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> dread. Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said the film accepts the [...] "ridiculousness" [...] of what it is trying to accomplishmainly the [...] "death and dismemberment" [...] of [...] "party-hungry kids", and that audiences would enjoy it if they also recognized that. Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters' deaths, he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki's presence gave the film a [...] "less-good episode of Supernatural" [...] vibe.|$|E
500|$|At a 1994 Village Voice {{symposium}} {{about the}} film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, {{a survivor of}} three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed. Hungarian Jewish author Imre Kertész, a Holocaust survivor, feels {{it is impossible for}} life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed. Rabbi Uri D. Herscher found the film an [...] "appealing" [...] and [...] "uplifting" [...] demonstration of humanitarianism. Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.

500|$|Trumble was {{selected}} in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw {{his place in the}} touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him {{as a member of a}} team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. Wisden said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, [...] "...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia". In that season, Trumble took 148wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who [...] "was able to inspire [...] batsmen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> apprehension". [...] Wisden's summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, [...] "His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy" [...] and [...] "he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [...] side".|$|E
500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> regret, not for {{the fate of the}} people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E
500|$|Allgame felt Nuclear Strike [...] "is {{really nothing}} more than a repackaged version of the earlier game". The {{reviewer}} felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV. GameFan called Nuclear Strike [...] "a tangible improvement over its predecessor" [...] and [...] "a more satisfying experience all round." [...] The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike, saying they [...] "make for a far richer, more active playing experience." [...] He recommended it to Soviet Strike devotees, while Power Play recommended it for fans of action games. IGN wrote the game was a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series, also citing a broader range of vehicles over Soviet Strike. Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game's predecessor, saying [...] "at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [...] It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same." [...] GameFan's reviewers called Nuclear Strike [...] "the definitive strike game" [...] and said it [...] "trounces all other Strikes that have come before." [...] Previewing the PlayStation version, Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects, missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series. In its review, the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games, but felt the control system, explosions, helicopter sound effects to be excellent. Next Generation said: [...] "Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike are certain to like Nuclear Strike even more", but said the games are almost indistinguishable. Game Revolution acknowledged the game is [...] "basically the same rehash of its predecessors, but it stands as a great game on its own. Nuclear Strike is a definite buy for fans who haven't tired of the series, and at least a 'rent me' for those who have been locked in the closet and haven't played any 'Strike' games." [...] Edge said: [...] "Fans of the series lusting after more above-viewed shooting action will naturally welcome this latest regurgitation. The seasoned gamer, however, will no doubt walk away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> déja vu." ...|$|E

[...] No news report exists indicating the plan was carried out. Lukens was then four months shy of his 67th birthday.|$|E
2500|$|Port Adelaide – The {{rivalry with}} Port Adelaide {{stems from the}} Power being known as the Magpies in their local SANFL {{competition}} before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder Kane Cornes 'flipped the bird' at Nick Davis following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at AAMI Stadium in Round 9, 2002, only moments after Anthony Rocca had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. Jarrod Molloy and Brodie Holland remonstrated with Cornes after the match, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG.

2500|$|Her third {{release was}} Mahesh Bhatt's romantic comedy Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke {{opposite}} Aamir Khan, which many critics called her career's best performance. Critics wrote [...] "Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla have already {{proved to be}} a great on-screen pair and here they shine once again. Aamir Khan is effective in a suitably restrained performance but it is Juhi Chawla who steals the show with her comic nirvana. Easily she is the funniest actor in the history of Hindi cinema {{and it would be a}} tough challenge for any actor to match up to that. Moreover, her effortless dialogue delivery in Tamil (especially for someone who doesn't speak the language) only further prove what a gifted actress she is." [...] Another critic wrote [...] "The film ultimately belongs to Juhi, because she is the soul of all things. She is the active reason of things happening. She is the fun. She is that innocence people love. It is difficult to imagine any other actress in this role. Such is her natural charm and comic sense in this one, and she truly deserved the Filmfare she received. Looking sweet and simple throughout the film she makes you smile with her mere presence. This is definitely her best performance. Add to it she is acting opposite Aamir, the two compliment each other and share a crackling chemistry and you are left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> bliss". The pairing of Chawla with Khan (one of the most popular on screen pairings of the '90s) resulted in hype over the film's release, and it proved a major commercial and critical success. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the film.|$|E
