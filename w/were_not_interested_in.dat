5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Despite the game's {{receiving}} general {{critical acclaim}} and selling well, Peter Jackson, {{director of the}} Lord of the Rings film trilogy, stated that the video game tie-in for his next film, King Kong, would not be developed by EA but by Ubisoft. Jackson's manager claimed that despite EA saying the filmmakers were heavily involved {{in the making of}} the game, the developers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Jackson's input on the game. Additionally, Jackson had played Beyond Good & Evil, and wanted to work with producer Michel Ancel, who was at Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years. During this time, she {{wanted to become a}} theater artist, and she participated in an audition in her school during her sixth grade. She did not pass the audition as she lacked talent in performing, but her singing was praised. This event would leave an impression on her, and as her parents <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> her taking up performance arts, she decided that she wanted to become a singer.|$|E

5|$|McBride {{attended}} Westminster College in Missouri, {{where he}} was a baseball, basketball, and track athlete. He set the school record in the 200-meter dash. McBride pitched in college, but when he attended a tryout session with the St. Louis Cardinals, personnel at the tryout <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> McBride's pitching. They thought his running ability held promise. McBride was selected by the Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1970 MLB draft. Though McBride left college early to enter professional baseball, he later graduated from Westminster.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, {{licensed}} by Liechtenstein's Government, {{became the first}} broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time {{because they had no}} budget for membership.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E

5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough {{for it to be}} worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{has several}} times been {{launched}} {{as a potential}} location for a ski jumping hill. The first idea came in 1912; later options to replace Holmenkollbakken resurfaced during the 1930s and the 1970s, but were quickly rejected. With the closing of Midtstubakken, Oslo's normal hill, in the late 1980s, Rødkleiva was again launched as a jumping hill. Vikersundbakken—Northern Europe's only ski flying hill—was in the late 1990s proposed replaced by a new hill in Rødkleiva. The plans received support from the Norwegian Ski Federation, but the municipality and state <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> issuing grants and the proposal was finally laid to rest in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the high}} regard held for {{dominion}} troops {{as a result of}} their exploits in France during the war they were specifically targeted for recruitment. Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)—who were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war—initially indicated a willingness to join, but nowhere near as many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E

5|$|In September 1929, Wessel met Erna Jänicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in {{a tavern}} {{not far from}} Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke's procurer. On 1 November she moved into his room {{on the third floor}} of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sub-let from 29-year old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Freedom Fighter, {{although}} she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent; Salm wanted Jänicke to leave, but she refused to, and Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help on the evening of 14 January 1930. At first the Communists <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> helping her, as she was not well-liked by them because of her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and get him out of Salm's flat by force.|$|E
5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few.

Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Professor Bernard Quatermass {{was first}} {{introduced}} to audiences in two BBC television serials, The Quatermass Experiment (1953) and Quatermass II (1955), written by Nigel Kneale. The rights to both these serials were acquired by Hammer Film Productions, and the film adaptations – The Quatermass Xperiment and Quatermass 2, both directed by Val Guest and starring Brian Donlevy as Quatermass – were released in 1955 and 1957 respectively. Kneale went on to write a third Quatermass serial – Quatermass and the Pit – for the BBC, which was broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. Hammer were once again interested in making a film adaptation, and Kneale, who had by then left the BBC and {{was working as a}} freelance screenwriter, completed a script in 1961. It was intended that Val Guest would once again direct and Brian Donlevy would reprise the role of Quatermass, with production to commence in 1963. However, securing finance for the new Quatermass film proved problematic. In 1957 Hammer had struck a deal with Columbia Pictures to distribute their pictures, and the two companies would go on to collaborate on thirty films between 1957 and 1964. Columbia, who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Quatermass, passed on the script and production went into limbo for several years. In 1964 Kneale and Anthony Hinds submitted a revised, lower-budget script to Columbia; but by this time the relationship between Hammer and Columbia had begun to sour, and the script was once again rejected. In 1966 Hammer entered into a new distribution deal with Seven Arts, ABPC and Twentieth Century Fox, and Quatermass and the Pit finally entered production.|$|E
