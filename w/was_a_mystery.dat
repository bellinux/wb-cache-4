5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At the time it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> {{as to why they}} varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring {{out what was going}} on.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E

25|$|When maize {{was first}} {{introduced}} into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-American peoples, it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity. However, a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a staple food. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery,</b> since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous Americans, for whom maize was the principal staple food.|$|E
25|$|Coastal California has a {{rich history}} of marine {{utilization}} by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> {{prior to the}} 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners sailed right over Cordell Bank without even knowing it was there.|$|E

25|$|Mithraism, {{also known}} as the Mithraic mysteries, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> {{religion}} centred around the god Mithras that was practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to the 4th century CE. The religion was inspired by Persian worship of the god Mithra (proto-Indo-Iranian Mitra), though the Greek Mithras was linked to a new and distinctive imagery, and the level of continuity between Persian and Greco-Roman practice is debated. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military.|$|E
25|$|The tooth-based taxon Aublysodon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> for a {{long time}} since no further {{skeletal}} elements were found that could be assigned with certainty to the teeth. In the early twentieth century it was assumed by some workers that it represented a member of the Ornithomimidae when it was not yet known this group was toothless. Lawrence Morris Lambe in 1902 referred the tooth to Struthiomimus; Hay in 1930 renamed A. mirandus into Ornithomimus mirandus, forgetting in that case Aublysodon would have priority.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he was the}} man {{responsible}} for its technology, Farnsworth appeared only once on a television program. On July 3, 1957, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> guest ("Doctor X") on the CBS quiz show I've Got A Secret. He fielded questions from the panel as they unsuccessfully tried to guess his secret ("I invented electronic television."). For stumping the panel, he received $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes. Host Garry Moore then spent a few minutes discussing with Farnsworth his research on such projects as high-definition television, flat-screen receivers, and fusion power.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{the noble}} gases neon and xenon were {{discovered}} to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites. Their origin {{and the type}} of matter that contained them <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a mass spectrometer, an instrument that is able to count the relative abundances of the isotopes of noble gases that are trapped in the meteorite sample. During the 1970s similar mass spectrometers discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes. Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.|$|E
25|$|As the RAF {{presence}} in France was reduced, its aviation fuel requirements fell and by 5 June, {{most of the}} RAF aircraft had returned to England but deliveries continued. British armoured units also made less demand on fuel supplies {{as the number of}} vehicles dwindled, until the main users of fuel were the transport echelons of the front-line units and the lines-of-communication troops, which could be supplied by the fuel delivered up to the end of May. Karslake wrote that the small number of armoured vehicles removed from France <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> and that a train with the last tanks of the 2nd Armoured Brigade and some of those of the 3rd Armoured Brigade had departed from Le Mans for St Malo and disappeared. It was rumoured that the train had been sidelined by the French and the engine removed for another train but no effort was made by the road parties outside Brest to find their vehicles. No party accompanied the vehicles and no aircraft reconnaissance was sought, even though the Germans were a long way from Brittany.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two shows in the continuity, Models Inc. did not experience any significant changes in character focus or tone. Instead, the writers chose to explore the ensemble cast from the start and immediately present the kind of story lines that had made Melrose Place famous. The initial focus of the series <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> surrounding the murder of model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov), who'd announced her intentions to leave the agency. For a number of episodes throughout the first story arc, suspects included Hillary, Teri's ex-boyfriend Brian (Cameron Daddo), Teri's rival Julie (Kylie Travis), and Teri's own sister Carrie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Once the killer was revealed, the characters moved on, with their focus switching {{to the arrival of}} Stephanie Romanov's new character Monique, a model who was a nearly dead ringer for Teri. The remainder of the series largely centered around the models' growing relationships with their boyfriends and each other, while also dealing with the issues of substance abuse and the pressures of the business. Primary antagonists included several figures from the models' pasts—including a stalker, a jealous sister, and Grayson (Emma Samms), the cunning and powerful ex-wife of Monique's fiance.|$|E
500|$|With {{the second}} {{configuration}} enclosed in a lead box, {{the results showed}} that some cosmic rays interact in lead to produce multiple secondary particles. [...] In an extension of the second experiment, he measured the rate of triple coincidences {{as a function of the}} amount of the lead above the counters. A plot of this rate against thickness, which came to be known as the Rossi curve, showed a rapid rise as the lead layer was increased, followed by a slow decline. [...] These experiments showed that ground-level cosmic rays consist of two components: a [...] "soft" [...] component which is capable of prolific generation of multiple particle events, and a [...] "hard" [...] component which is capable of traversing great thicknesses of lead. [...] At the time, the physical nature of both <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery,</b> for they did not yet fit into the growing body of knowledge about nuclear and particle physics.|$|E
500|$|The five {{participants}} for the King of the Mountain match were determined {{in a series}} of standard wrestling matches that took place on Impact! leading up to the event, with Angle defeating Rhino in the first bout to gain entry on the May 17 episode of Impact!. On the May 24 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe defeated Sting to become the second participant. The third qualification match was held on the May 31 episode of Impact! between A.J. Styles and Tomko, which Styles won. The next bout pitted Chris Harris against James Storm on the June 7 episode Impact!, which ended in a double disqualification, therefore neither man advanced to the King of the Mountain match. The final qualification match was won by Christian Cage over Abyss on the June 14 episode of Impact!. Angle ended up winning the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary over Joe, Cage, Styles and Harris, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> participant chosen by Cornette, to become the [...] "undisputed TNA World Heavyweight Champion".|$|E
