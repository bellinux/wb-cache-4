500|$|The {{start of}} the {{following}} season continued the same trend for O'Keefe as he made just eight appearances during {{the first five months}} of the season before returning to the starting line up against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 16 January 2016, in a match that Cardiff went on to win 3–1. O'Keefe's performances saw him establish himself in the first team and his attitude to being left out of the team for long periods drew praise from Cardiff manager Russell Slade who commented [...] "Stuart has got a fantastic attitude, he's a real, real good professional, even when he wasn't in the side he was pushing. [...] some players when they're not in the side get disillusioned and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on,</b> but not O'Keefe." [...] He later scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 victory during a Severnside derby match against Bristol City on 5 March 2016, adding his second one-month later with the winning goal during a 2–1 win over Derby County on 2 April. He finished the season having made 27 appearances for the club in all competitions, the most appearances he has made during a season to date and {{the first time in his}} career he made over 20 appearances in a single season.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the variety of content on the album. NME said, [...] "There's a {{creeping}} notion that every musical idea that's ever been so much as thought up is on this album." [...] In addition, Random Access Memories is ranked #497 on NMEs list, [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork echoed this sentiment, calling the record [...] "a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast {{and even a few}} pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that [...] "though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect." [...] Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. DJ Magazine {{commented on the}} shift in Daft Punk's musical style: [...] "While Daft Punk clearly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making." [...] Resident Advisor stated that [...] "it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic." [...] In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record [...] "taps into the wonder and excitement" [...] of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, [...] "Random Access Memories is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it." ...|$|E
