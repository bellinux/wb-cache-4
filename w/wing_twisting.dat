The sailplane GROB G 103 -B {{was used as a}} reference for the performed analysis. The available data of the reference aircraft were exclusively related to its geometric, aerodynamic and global inertial properties; in order to build up the structural model for the wing, a “reverse engineering” was therefore carried out. Referring to CS- 22 airworthiness requirements, a preliminary sizing of the wing structure was obtained by using elementary methods. The structural lay-out was then verified by means of a more advanced finite element analysis. The aeroelastic model of the wing was generated and the inertial contributes of empennages and fuselage were properly taken in account. Elastic aircraft roll dynamic was at first investigated considering conventional aileron-based control strategy. Extra-modes representative of several variable twist laws were then added to aircraft dynamic model in order to simulate <b>wing</b> <b>twist</b> morphing; roll dynamic based on <b>wing</b> <b>twist</b> morphing was finally analyzed.

5000|$|Because cabane struts often carry {{engine thrust}} {{to the upper}} wing to {{overcome}} its drag, the loads along each diagonal between fore and aft struts are unequal and they are often formed as N-struts.

In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning.

However, in this case the generated thrust is either very small, or even negative, depending on the wing shape. Further, results show that morphing of the wing enables {{a significant increase in the}} thrust and propulsive efficiency.

Anonlinear aero-elastic model is derived, and it is used to study the steady-state performance and flight stability of the micro aerial vehicle.

40|$|The current {{experimental}} study on a two-dimensional oscillating aerofoil aims to isolate {{and explore the}} effects of <b>wing</b> <b>twisting,</b> {{one of the most}} basic aspects of insect locomotion. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is employed to study the effects of reduced frequency as well as angular amplitude on an impulsively started aerofoil oscillating which is initially at rest. The forced oscillation is of a sinusoidal nature about a mid-chord, spanwise axis and all investigations are carried out at a Reynolds number of 1000, with amplitudes in the range of 20 º to 60 º, typical of the regime that insects tend to operate within. A piston tank facility is used to generate the impulsively started motion. The ensemble averaged results obtained suggest that both the reduced frequency and angular amplitude are important governing parameters which influence the development of leading edge structures and subsequent wake vortices. In the limiting case (i. e. fixed angle of attack), the resulting flow field is one fairly similar to that of a bluff body, with the distinct, periodic formation of a von Karman vortex street. In the lower reduced frequency cases, the flow displays characteristics similar to the former, except that the effect of the aerofoil oscillation imposes a velocity component on the flow which seems to retard the leading edge separation. In contrast, in the higher reduced frequency cases, where the velocity component imparted by the oscillatory motion is much higher than that of the freestream, the effect of the freestream velocity seems to be almost non-existent. Vortices are generated in an anti-symmetric manner at both the leading and trailing edges, but whilst the trailing edge vortices are advected downstream, the leading edge vortices are negated before advection can occur...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the <b>wing</b> <b>twist</b> of {{the active}} {{aeroelastic}} wing (AAW) F/A- 18 aircraft is a fundamental research objective for the program and offers numerous benefits. In order to clearly understand the wing flexibility characteristics, a model was created to predict real-time <b>wing</b> <b>twist.</b> A reliable twist model allows the prediction of twist for flight simulation, provides insight into aircraft performance uncertainties, and assists with computational fluid dynamic and aeroelastic issues. The left wing of the aircraft was heavily instrumented during the first phase {{of the active}} aeroelastic wing program allowing deflection data collection. Traditional data processing steps were taken to reduce flight data, and twist predictions were made using linear regression techniques. The model predictions determined a consistent linear relationship between the measured twist and aircraft parameters, such as surface positions and aircraft state variables. Error in the original model was reduced in some cases by using a dynamic pressure-based assumption. This technique produced excellent predictions for flight between the standard test points and accounted for nonlinearities in the data.
