50|$|The {{welding process}} for re-manufactured {{crankshafts}} is called submerged arc welding. It is a powdered flux plus a weld which combines {{to produce a}} more precise weld. The most common flux powder used is called #1 Flux 2245 HD. This powder {{eliminates the need for}} technicians to wear <b>weld</b> <b>masking</b> and reduces the amount of dust by-product.|$|R
5|$|In addition, the {{vaporizing}} {{metal and}} flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter. The smoke produced contains particles {{of various types}} of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest <b>welding</b> <b>masks</b> are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.|$|R

50|$|The {{optical filter}} in <b>welding</b> goggles, face <b>mask</b> or helmet {{must be a}} type which is {{suitable}} {{for the sort of}} work being done.

Failure to use such protection when arc welding or even being near where arc welding is going on can result in a painful condition called “arc eye” or photokeratitis, which is akin to a severe sunburn of the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye.|$|R
50|$|The Former Workshop is a {{rectangular}} timber and weatherboard {{building with a}} gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. It has a timber parapet an awning and a double door on the west side. There are open skillion verandahs on the west and {{north side of the}} building and a corrugated iron clad skillion section on the rear, or east side. The machinery housed in the workshop were operated by a set of interconnected flat belts running to a single electric engine and drive shaft which is still present. Machinery includes a drill press, mechanical hacksaw, set of grinding wheels, a hydraulic press, a large bandsaw, a large metal lathe, a small lathe and a fan set to the forge in the blacksmiths room {{at the rear of the}} building. A short chimney protrudes through the roof above the blacksmiths forge. Tools such as spanners, and equipment including scrap iron, an old welder and <b>welding</b> <b>masks</b> remain in situ on the workbench.

40|$|Introduction: Safety and hygiene are of {{considerable}} importance {{to a healthy}} life. They guarantee people`s protection against disease and fatal dangers. Having knowledge about the environmental pollutants helps to realize how hazardous these harms are and can result in providing the ground to develop an economically and technically proper technology. Examples of dangerous elements at workshops are fume, smoke and vapour rising from electrical arch which expose workers to health risk factors. Therefore, for controlling such pollutants, {{we have to use}} appropriate technology materials & procedures. The semiautomatic <b>weld</b> <b>mask</b> with capability of protecting eyesight and breathing system against metal vapour and radiations during welding controls the rays from electrical arches and prevents the rising fume form being breathed in by workers. Materials & Methods: Invention of this mask has been developed academically at Ilam Medical University. The fiberglass part of this specifically shaped mask is placed on the chest and prevents the dense fume with high rate of pollutants to be breathed by workers. However, this mask has a fixable length from both sides which is higher than the vertical position of the worker`s nape. The quality of this mask considering its two-sided feature and suitable length helps workers breathe less-dense fume and by blocking the way of dense fume upward, also decreases the pollutants and facilitates the way of fresh air from behind. The density of fume is less in comparison to that moving in front of the worker`s heads. This mask is registered in the national invention registeration department with the registration number 33786. Conclusion: The invented mask was examined. Considering the investigative results, using this mask can decrease a high amount of pollutants in the air workers breathe in. Furthermore, harmful rays such as infrared and ultraviolet will not strike worker`s eyes anymore. The shortage of desired technology in our province and high expenses in other cities of Iran were, unfortunately, the significant reasons for not developing such an essential device...|$|R
40|$|In this work, two {{significant}} advances in photolithographic patterning of polyaniline (PANI) films are reported. Firstly, flash welding was enhanced {{through the use}} of polymeric substrates, enabling complete penetration of the welding of PANI films with thicknesses ranging from 5 to over 14 mu m, significantly thicker than reported previously. Masking of parts of the PANI films during flash welding enabled the formation of adjacent conducting and insulating regions as the welding changes the electrical properties of the film. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the sharpness of these edges, and indicated that the interface between the flash <b>welded</b> and <b>masked</b> regions of the PANI films was typically less than 15 mu m wide. Secondly, using longpass filters, light with a wavelength less than 570 nm was found not to contribute to the welding process. This was confirmed by the use of a 635 nm laser diode for welding the PANI films. This novel approach enabled patterning of PANI films using a direct writing technique with a narrow wavelength light source...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the author {{examined}} the physicochemical properties and the atomospheric levels of manganese and other heavy metals in the {{suspended particulate matter}} of a welding workshop and a residential area neighboring an iron works. α-Fe(2) O(3) and Fe(3) O(4) were {{the main components of}} the suspended particulate matter collected in the atomosphere around both areas. The total suspended particulate matter of the welding process (welding TSP) also contained MnFe(2) O(4) formed from Fe(3) O(4) by exchange of Fe with Mn, metalic Mn and an alloy from of Mn-Fe. These findings were obtained by X-ray diffractometry. Observation through the electron microscope showed the presence of fin particles (0. 5 - 1. 5 μm) in welding TSP, and attention should be given hazards. The concentration of the metals in the welding TSP was about 10 to 30 times higher than that in the covering materials of the welding rods. Exposure levels of manganese in the welding workshop at a breathing zone ranged from 0. 4 to 1. 0 μg/m(3) and the levels were reduced to one tenth by using a <b>welding</b> <b>mask.</b> Levels of manganese have decreased from a maximum median levels of 0. 24 μg/m(3) in 1971 to 0. 15 μg/m(3) in 1981.

50|$|Polyaniline nanofibers {{have been}} used in the {{creation}} of monolithic actuators. They can be used in this application due to their ability to be flash-welded. When exposed to light, polyaniline converts the absorbed energy directly into heat. In a polyaniline film, the heat is dispersed throughout the polymer. In polyaniline nanofibers, however, the heat is trapped within the individual fibers. Therefore, if the intensity of the light is great enough, it will cause the temperature of the nanofibers to rise rapidly, which causes them to weld together or burn. With a moderate flash intensity, the nanofibers will melt rapidly to form a smooth film. Using <b>mask,</b> <b>welds</b> in specific patterns can be made using this technique. In a thick enough sample of nanofibers, only the side exposed to the flash will be welded, creating an asymmetric film where one side remains intact as nanofibers while the other side is effectively crosslinked due to welding. These asymmetric films demonstrate rapid reversible actuation in the presence of acids and bases, in the form of bending and curling. The advantages polyaniline nanofiber asymmetric films have over other actuators include the ease of synthesis, large degree of bending, patternability, and no delamination. These actuators could be used in the development of microtweezers, microvalves, artificial muscles, chemical sensors, and patterned actuator structures.|$|R
