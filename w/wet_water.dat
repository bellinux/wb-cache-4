40|$|Internal {{corrosion}} occurs {{only when}} corrosive <b>water</b> <b>wets</b> the pipe inner wall. However, <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> {{is one of}} most important missing links of our current overall understanding of internal corrosion {{of oil and gas}} pipelines. In this study, extensive experimental studies on <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> in large diameter horizontal oil-water pipe flows were carried out. Four main techniques (wall conductance probes, Fe 2 + concentration monitoring, wall sampling and flow pattern visualization) were used to determine phase wetting on the internal wall of pipe at different superficial oil and water velocities. Four flow patterns were observed: stratified flow, stratified flow with mixed layer, semi-dispersed and dispersed flows. Three types of phase <b>wetting</b> regimes (<b>water</b> <b>wetting,</b> intermittent wetting and oil wetting) were determined. A comprehensive phase wetting map was obtained based on the overlapping information from these techniques. 1 Based on the results of corrosion monitoring, it was found that a complete absence of corrosion is guaranteed only when oil wetting occurs. At the same superficial oil velocity, the corrosion rate under <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> is much higher than that under intermittent wetting. Phase wetting significantly affects the corrosion rate. A comparison was carried out between the mechanistic water entrainment and separation model 8 - 9 and experimental results. A good agreement was achieved...|$|R

40|$|At high ambient temperature, the {{air cooled}} HX {{capacity}} can be boosted by using evaporation {{of a water}} film applied directly on the heat exchanger surface in deluge, spray, or mist cooling mode. In order to accurately determine evaporatively cooled HX capacity, {{it is critical to}} know the portion of fin area wetted. However, wetting inherently is a highly non-uniform phenomenon dependent on the method of application, evaporation rate and air velocity. Furthermore, for typical optimized air cooled HXs the fin geometry is often complex and spacing narrow. This study presents a novel method to quantify HX wetted fin area through enhanced visualization in HX depth and sectional flow rate measurement. Flow maps for deluge and front spray cooling are presented at varying inlet air velocities and <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> flow rates. This study confirms that a significant portion of HX remains dry which contributes to low experimentally obtained HX heat transfer rates, irrespective of wetting method even under moderate to high <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> flow rates. Furthermore, it highlights the need for developing HX wetting technologies that ensure uniform wetting at lowest wetting flow rates...|$|R

50|$|<b>WET</b> (<b>Water</b> Entertainment Technologies) also {{designed}} the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas, which {{are set in}} a man-made lake 1000 ft long with an area of 9 acre. The fountain {{is formed as a}} pair of large concentric rings and a long, curved arc, and two smaller circles are attached to the arc near each end. Shooters outline all aspects of the layout, allowing for the arc and circles to rise as columns and curtains of water, as well as providing high-speed chase sequences. Re-engineered HyperShooters fire jets nearly 240 ft into the air, and more recently added ExtremeShooters are capable of reaching heights of 500 ft. Needing a better way to define smoother passages of music, WET engineers developed the Oarsman nozzle, a robotic water jet that can be moved 120 degrees from side to side, to front and back, grouped with a pod of lights that follow the water stream. With the direction, water height, and light of every Oarsman controllable independently from every other Oarsman, a nearly infinite variety of patterns can be created on the lake. A fog generating device rises from beneath the water to blanket the entire lake with fog, and about 4000 individually controllable underwater lights follow the water patterns' precise movements, sparkling on the water or glowing through the fog. Performing to everything from opera to classical to Broadway to pop, the Fountains of Bellagio run every day on the half-hour, and every quarter-hour during the evening. A team of dive-certified engineers is on-site at all times, maintaining the fountain's complex mechanical, electrical and hydraulic systems.|$|E

40|$|Air {{or water}} cooled heat {{exchangers}} (HX) are typically utilized as condensers or coolers for air-conditioning, refrigeration or process cooling applications in both {{commercial and industrial}} sector. However, {{air cooled heat exchanger}} performance degrades considerably with rise in ambient air temperature and water cooled coolers require considerable pumping power, a cooling tower and may consume a significant amount of water which may come from fresh water sources. Evaporative cooling offers a unique solution to this problem, where a small amount of <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> evaporates on HX surface to boost performance in high ambient air temperature conditions. In this study, several evaporative cooling technologies were applied to three wavy-fin HXs to quantify capacity enhancement ratio (CER) and air-side pressure drop penalty ratio (PR&# 916;Pa) compared to respective dry case baseline values. Effect of varying <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> flow rate, air velocity, fin spacing, hydrophilic coatings, spray orientation and inlet air temperature and relative humidity was investigated on hybrid heat exchanger performance. Several new performance comparison parameters were defined to compare different evaporative cooling approaches. Deluge cooling achieved overall highest CER but at a PR&# 916;Pa that was similar in magnitude to the CER. This limitation was found to be inherent to the nature of <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> distribution method itself. Although front spray cooling tests indicated PR&# 916;Pa~ 1, front spray evaporative cooling technology was found to have up to 23 - 75 % lower CER at 60 - 100 % lower PR&# 916;Pa compared to deluge cooling. In order to understand the wetting behavior a novel visualization method was proposed and implemented, which consisted of borescope assisted flow mapping of water distribution within the HX core as a function of air velocities and <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> flow rates. It was found that up to 85 % of HX volume remained dry during front spray cooling which accounted for lower capacity enhancement and deluge cooling forms non-uniform and thick water film which causes bridging and increased PR&# 916;Pa, A larger component level testing with HX size similar to commercial units allowed to identify constraints of different evaporative cooling methods, which would not be possible if tests were performed at a smaller segment or fin level. A novel spray cooling technology utilizing internal jet spray cooling within HX volume was both proposed and implemented and a provisional patent # 61 / 782, 825 was obtained. Compared to front spray cooling at a given spray rate, internal spray cooling could either achieve up to 35 % higher HX cooler capacity, or obtain same HX cooler capacity at approximately three times lower air-side pressure drop. Alternatively, at same air-side pressure drop <b>wetting</b> <b>water</b> savings of up to 68 - 97 % are achieved. Internal spraying combines advantages of conventional technologies and overcomes the drawbacks, by getting CER of approx. 3. 8, without film carryover and at PR&# 916;Pa= 1, while getting maximum wetting uniformity. Intermittent cooling combined with internal spraying could reduce water consumption as evaporative cooling sustains though the brief period when spray is turned off. Thus, potential for significant energy and water savings, targeted cooling, and retrofit design offers significant commercialization opportunity for future hybrid evaporative coolers. Discussions are underway for the inclusion of this technology into product line up of a leading HX manufacturing company...|$|R
