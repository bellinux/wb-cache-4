The aim of the present paper is {{to contribute to the}} characterisation of the stratigr a p hy and petrogr a p hy of this little studied succession, and briefly discuss some aspects of the eru p t ive style of its volcanism. The succession is about 470 m thick and is here subdivided into five lithostratigraphic units (A to E from base to top). Unit A, approximately 120 m thick, is mainly composed of polymict clast-supported volcaniclastic breccias and also includes a dacitic lava laye r. Interstratified in the breccias of this unit, there is a thin laminated devitrified layer which shows some degree of <b>welding.</b> <b>Unit</b> B, approx imately 70 m thick, is almost entirely composed of volcaniclastic breccias, and includes a volcaniclastic conglomerate laye r. Breccias in this unit can be subdivided into two distinct types; polymict clast-supported breccias, and monomict matrix-supported breccias rich in juvenile components and displaying incipient <b>welding.</b> <b>Unit</b> C, about 65 m thick, is mainly composed of basaltic lavas, which are interlayered with minor vo lcaniclastic breccias. Unit D, approximately 65 m thick, is lithologically similar to unit B, composed of an alternation of polymict clasts upported breccias and matrix-supported breccias, and includes a volcaniclastic conglomerate laye r. Unit E, about 150 m thick, is mainly formed of thick andesitic lava layers. Minor basaltic dykes and a few normal faults cut the succession, and the contact betwe e n units A and B can be interpreted both as an unconformity or a fault. The matrix-supported breccias included in the succession of Hannah Point have high contents of juvenile components and incipient welding, which suggest that part of the succession is the result of pyroclastic fragmentation and emplacement from pyroclastic flows. In contrast, the polymict clast-supported breccias suggest reworking of previous deposits and deposition from cool mass flows. The lavas indicate eff u s ive volcanic eruptions, and the absence of features indicative of subaqueous volcanism suggests that at least these portions of the succession were emplaced in a subaerial environment...|$|E
40|$|While CNC {{machining}} (subtractive method) is {{the only}} option {{when it comes to}} high quality components, it demands greater human intervention to generate the CNC programs, making it a slow and costly route.

40|$|Rheomorphic {{structures}} in welded ignimbrites are {{commonly associated with}} deposition from hot pyroclastic flows on inclined topography or by tractional shear on aggrading agglutinate by the pyroclastic density current. We describe a type of rheomorphic deformation involving the formation of diapirs in ignimbrite following the re-equilibration of internal gravitational instabilities within the deposit. We show that diapirs can develop in horizontal welded ignimbrites that have an inverted density stratification. The interpretation of these {{structures in}} terms of their dynamics and kinematics can help in defining the timing of the deformation history of ignimbrites. The rhyolitic Serra di Paringianu Ignimbrite is the uppermost, largest ignimbrite of Cenozoic volcanism in SW Sardinia. A detailed study at La Punta, north of San Pietro island (Sardinia; Italy), schematically characterized by a twin sequence of densely welded and partially <b>welded</b> ignimbrite flow <b>units</b> of the Serra di Paringianu Ignimbrite, revealed the presence of mushroom and pillow-shaped diapiric structures, constituted by material of an intermediate, partially <b>welded,</b> flow <b>unit</b> intruding into an upper, densely <b>welded,</b> <b>unit.</b> The diapirs are generally connected with their source region and show both vertical and lateral variations in the textural and physical features. The uppermost densely <b>welded</b> <b>unit</b> is deformed within a few meters of the diapiric structures, with the foliation pattern of the surrounding ignimbrite enveloping the cup region of diapirs. We used the existing numerical models of cooling–compaction of welded ignimbrites to constrain the time scale for the development of specific rheomorphic structures. We present a model in which the diapirism involves the buoyant rise of partially welded lithofacies into the densely welded cover in a time scale of a few months. The diapir model takes into account the rheology of the host and intruding layers and explains the textural and physical modifications both experienced by the partially welded lithofacies during rise and induced in the host layers. The model shows that the time scale of the diapiric rise well agrees with the time scale of the cooling process of the upper portion of the ignimbrite...|$|R

Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a systematic method and thus is capable of analyzing the risks of systems from concept phase to system disposal, detecting the failures in design stage, and determining the control measures and corrective actions for failures to reduce their impacts. The objectives of this research were to perform FMEA to identify risks in an Iranian petrochemical industry and determine the decrease of the risk priority number (RPN) after implementation of intervention programs. This interventional study was performed at one petrochemical plant in Tehran, Iran in 2014. Relevant information about job categories and plant process was gathered using brainstorming techniques, fishbone diagram, and group decision making. The data were collected through interviews, observation, and documents investigations and was recorded in FMEA worksheets. The necessary corrective measures were performed {{on the basis of the}} results of initial FMEA. Forty eight failures were identified in <b>welding</b> <b>unit</b> by application of FMEA to assess risks. Welding processes especially working at height got the highest RPN.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis {{was to develop}} a designguideline which will simplify the {{development}} of new products that will be laser welded. The need for this thesis has come forward from the quality problems that Volvo Construction Equipment, Components Division is having with their laser welding manufacturing unit. The reason for the problems emerges from the bad communication between the development unit and the manufacturing unit within the company when the products produced today was developed. This resulted in products that were hard to and in some cases almost impossible to weld.   To avoid these problems from occurring again it was needed to gather the experiences within this area and compile it and present in a brief a pedagogical manner. The information for the groundwork of our results has been gathered by interviews of several key persons in Volvo Construction Equipment, Components Division.

The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. In order to withstand the electro-mechanical forces during the operation of the CMS magnet, the superconducting cable embedded in a 99. 998 % pure aluminum matrix is reinforced with two sections of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082 assembled by continuous Electron Beam Welding (EBW). A dedicated production line has been designed by Techmeta, a leading company in the field of EBW. The production line has a total length of 70 m. Non-stop welding of each of the 20 lengths of 2. 5 km, required to build the coil, will last 22 hours. EBW is the most critical process involved in the production line. The main advantage of the EBW process is to minimize the Heat Affected Zone; this is particularly important for avoiding damage to the superconducting cable located only 4. 7 mm from the welded joints. Two welding guns of 20 kW each operate in parallel in a vacuum chamber fitted with dynamic airlocks. After welding, the conductor is continuously machined on the four faces and on each corner to obtain the required dimensions and surface finish. Special emphasis has been put on quality monitoring.

40|$|Because {{of surface}} roughness, {{the area of}} contact between real {{surfaces}} {{is less than the}} geometrical area. For this reason the known rules of acoustic reflection and transmission have to be modified for real interfaces. Ultrasonic transmission through imperfect interfaces is commonly described in terms of the contact stiffness model which assumes distributed springs between the surfaces in contact [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 202 244; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 89 (1991) 503 ff; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 68 1516; J. Nondestr. Eval. 4 177; J. Geophys. Res. 94 (1989) 17681 ff]. Several authors [Trans. ASME 123 8 ff; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 103 657 ff; Ultrasonics 38 513] theoretically and experimentally show the pressure and frequency dependence of the ultrasonic transmission through such interfaces. Our paper will document, that the temperature of the interface has significant influence on the ultrasonic transmission as well. In the experimental approach, a CuSn 8 -rod was clamped between the electrodes of a resistance <b>welding</b> <b>unit.</b> Either longitudinally or transversally polarised ultrasonic pulses were generated by a transmitter built in the upper electrode. The transmitted ultrasonic signal was subsequently detected by the receiver integrated in the lower electrode. After the welding current was turned on, a strong decrease in ultrasonic transmission has been observed due to resistance heating of the interfaces between the welding electrodes and the rod. To explain this extraordinary strong temperature effect, a simple quasistatic analytical thermal–electrical model of the contacting area was used to give a rough estimation of the maximum interfacial temperature and the temperature distribution during the flow of the welding current. In a second step, the temperature dependence of the material data in the acoustic contact stiffness model was used to calculate the changes in ultrasonic transmission caused by the welding current. It is shown, that the observed decrease in ultrasonic transmission with increasing temperature is mainly caused by the temperature dependence of the elastic constants of the metals and is much stronger than expected for ideal interfaces. The calculated ultrasonic transmission is in very good agreement with the experimental data and seems to be interpreted correctly by the acoustic contact stiffness model...|$|E
40|$|Allseas {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{offshore}} pipeline installation and subsea construction companies in the world. The process of pipeline installation is executed by operating specialised vessels, which are designed in-house. Allseas executes the pipeline installation with the S-lay method. The pieces of pipe (the joints) are assembled to form one pipeline in a horizontal working plane, the “firing line”, on board of the vessel. First the two joints are welded together, followed by the inspection step (Non-Destructive testing) and before leaving the vessel the pipe is coated (Field Joint Coating). The system analysed in this research is the equipment-unit of Pipeline Production Department (PPD). PPD is responsible for the preparation of all offshore welding, NDT and coating services. PPD encountered problems with timely delivery of their project equipment and consumables and seeks for measures to solve this. This thesis will focus on the internal supply chain of the <b>welding</b> <b>unit</b> within PPD. The other supply chains are out of scope due to the complexity of the whole system. Problem Definition Due to strict norms and regulations in the offshore industry almost all procedures need to be qualified onshore. Only if procedures get approval from the client, the process can continue. This imposes difficulties for the internal supply chain of the <b>welding</b> <b>unit.</b> The wish of Allseas is to control and optimise the logistics of project equipment and consumables for the <b>welding</b> <b>unit.</b> This means reducing the vulnerability of the internal supply chain for a disruption. The ability of a system to withstand and accommodate a disruption is called resilience. In this thesis the following definition of resilience is used: resilience is the ability of a system to return to its original form after unforeseen changes. This ability of the system can be defined in a twofold matter, the time to recover to the original form and the impact this unforeseen change temporarily has on the system. A system can develop resilience in a threefold manner by increasing redundancy, building flexibility into the system, and the right corporate culture. The work of Sheffi will be the theoretical framework for this thesis. By improving the flexibility of a chain the time_to_respond to a disruption will become shorter. A more resilient culture and a higher level of redundancy will reduce the impact of a disruption. Research Objective Based on the problem definition the following research objective can be stated: Increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain of Allseas' welding department to cope with the disruptions stemming from the seasonal planning. Based on the research objective the main research question for this thesis is the following: How to increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain of Allseas' welding department to cope with the disruptions stemming from the seasonal planning? This research question is assessed and the results of this research are shown in three parts: part I: qualitative analysis, part II: quantitative analysis, and part III: roadmap. Part I: Qualitative Analysis The goal of part I was to determine the root cause of the problem with handling disruptions. This in order to gain insights in the system and to search for the drivers behind the problems in the chain. This qualitative analysis starts with a disruption analysis followed by the bottlenecks and finished with a search for lessons learned from other industries. The disruption analysis is conducted based on a framework of disruption assessment by Jüttner, Peck, & Christopher. This framework makes a distinction between on the one hand risk sources and on the other hand risk drivers and their mitigating strategies. This framework is applied on Allseas for example when dealing with a vessel swap. The risk sources are not the main cause of problems in the disruption handling of PPD. The reason why the previous vessel swap was executed in such a chaotic way was due to a lack in general preparation at the equipment side and not communicating in a proper way. The supply chain risk drivers were the basis of the bottleneck analysis. By assessing the drivers as the bottlenecks. Clear problems were pinpointed and the effect of these bottlenecks on resilience is shown as well. 9 ̆ 5 Communication is a big problem within PPD. There is not a structured way to communicate and this influences the execution of projects. The lack of communication influences the flexibility of the chain because the current way of communicating consumes the much needed preparation time. 9 ̆ 5 The innovative culture of Allseas helped them to be one of the major companies in their industry; however it is now a threat to their supply chain. Innovations cannot be planned or scheduled and this implements high uncertainty to the chain. 9 ̆ 5 The current way of equipment handling does not have an explicit strategy, therefore it is not clear why some equipment is purchased and other equipment is rented (the make or buy decision). These uncertainties in the equipment pool influence the redundancy of the chain. In the chaotic ad-hoc way of working everyone choses the quick fix instead of working on a more fundamental solution. The measures that are going to be tested only have influence on the flexibility of the system and not on the redundancy or the culture of this system. This is due to the fact that improvements on redundancy cannot be tested in this system. The lack of transparency in the equipment pool makes it impossible to see whether or not improvements are made. Culture is as well not tested due to the ambiguous nature of this topic and is therefore difficult to quantify. Culture will, however, be part of the roadmap towards a resilient chain. Flexibility will be the core of the measures that will be tested in part II. Especially the time between different tasks is important. The influence of these tasks on each other and on the time to make the deadline of mobilisation of a project is important. ? Part II: Quantitative Analysis In part I the system was analysed and from the synthesis it can be concluded that the relations between different processes in a project are of major importance. The interdependencies between different projects influence the total project time. To assess the influence of the interdependencies the total project time the impact of the sequence of events is evaluated. This sequence of events is called the critical path of a project. One alternative set up will be tested in this analysis; this scenario is based on the conclusions of part I. The goal of the scenario analysis is to quantify the improvements in the internal supply chain of PPD. The changes in the process should be shown in a different critical path and a reduction in total process time. To improve the flexibility the two main lessons are taken into account in the improved schedule. 9 ̆ 5 The first lesson is to have a “Kingpin”, a central point to be the controller of the whole process. 9 ̆ 5 The second lesson is that preparation is key for flexibility. This is done by: a split in the information flow and the equipment flow and creating an explicit step of organising equipment. By decoupling planning of the equipment from the mobilisation process more time_to_respond is created. With these changes the chain will be more flexible in order to improve the resilience of the internal supply chain of welding equipment and consumables. From the analysis it can be concluded that the new supply chain set-up is more flexible and in the end will increase the resilience. The two disruptions did not have an effect on the internal supply chain in the new internal supply chain set-up. The effect of moving the step of planning the equipment forward in the chain created time_to_respond to a disruption. And with this creation build in the system one of the major aspects of a resilient chain is gained. Part III: Roadmap The framework of Sheffi proposed three types of solutions to increase the resilience of a supply chain. This can be done by increasing the flexibility and redundancy, and changing the culture. Per type of solution the following should be implemented to increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain. Flexibility; the procedures and the equipment needs to be pre-qualified onshore before going offshore. This is the reason that preparation is key. The new internal supply chain set-up splits the internal supply chain in an information and a physical flow of goods. With parallel processes the internal supply chain has time_to_respond to disruptions and contributes to a more resilient supply chain. Redundancy; the equipment database needs to be fully up to date before decisions concerning equipment can be made. When all the equipment is updated an assessment can be made on the criticalness of certain equipment. And criteria can be set up to make the make or buy decisions. Culture; the culture issue has not been a major part of this thesis. However, using the OCAI method as an initial analysis it is apparent that a culture change is a necessary. This cultural change is a precondition to implement the measures. MSc. Transport, Infrastructure & LogisticsTransport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheology}} of ignimbrites during welding and compaction {{has been}} matter {{of interest in}} recent years for the ability of welded ignimbrites to develop {{a wide variety of}} rheomorphic structures. The existence of numerical models able to reproduce the cooling-compaction history of welded ignimbrites allows to constrain the time scale for the development of specific rheomorphic structures and to test existing viscosity models. The Serra di Paringianu rhyolitic ignimbrite represents the youngest major ignimbrite of the Cenozoic volcanism of SW Sardinia. It widely crops out on San Pietro and Sant’Antioco islands, while scattered outcrops are present in the Sulcis mainland. A detailed study of La Punta section, north of San Pietro Island, schematically characterized by a twin sequence of densely welded and partially <b>welded</b> ignimbrite <b>units,</b> reveals the presence of mushroom-shaped diapiric structures constituted by the partially <b>welded</b> intermediate <b>unit</b> intruding the upper densely welded cover...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -D {{model of}} {{moisture}} flow within the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain {{is being developed}} at LBL in cooperation with USGS. This site-scale model covers an area of about 34 km{sup 2 } and is bounded by major faults to the north, east, and west. The relatively coarse-grid model includes about 300 horizontal grid-blocks and 17 layers. Contour maps and isopach maps are presented defining different types of infiltration zones, and the spatial distribution of Tiva Canyon, Paintbrush, and Topopah Spring hydrogeological units. Matrix flow is approximated using the van Genuchten model, and the equivalent continuum approximation is used to account for fracture flow in the <b>welded</b> <b>units.</b> One-, two-, and three-dimensional simulations are conducted using the TOUGH 2 computer program. Steady-state simulations are performed with various uniform and nonuniform infiltration rates; results are interpreted in terms of effect of fault characteristics on moisture flow distribution, and on the location and formation of preferential pathways...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter <b>welding</b> <b>units.</b> They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a stepdown transformer to produce the desired welding voltage or current. The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high switching frequency requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The high frequency inverter-based welding machines are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter welding machines.|$|R
40|$|Welded ignimbrites show a large {{variability}} of welding intensity and post-depositional crystallization. According to existing literature a complete characterization of <b>welded</b> ignimbritic <b>units</b> involves: l) a classification scheme which includes up to 5 - 6 categories of welding intensity; 2) {{the definition of}} the style of post depositional crystallization. This classification can be very time-consuming and well beyond the standards required for a general description of ignimbrite units for regional geological mapping purposes. During the geological survey of the San Pietro Island (Sardinia, Italy) in the framework of the new geological map of Italy on a scale l: 50000 (CARG Proiect), a large number of samples from different ignimbritic units has been collected. The geology of the area is characterized bv Oligocene-Miocene volcanic deposits, which testify for the intense explosive activity with the deposition of many variably <b>welded</b> ignimbritic <b>units</b> and, subordinately, local effusive activity, mainly characterized by the emplacement of lava coulees. All rhe products derive from the eruption of highly evolved magmas of both calc-alkaline and peralkaline affinity. We present here a new simplified scheme for the facies classification of these ignimbritic deposits. The scheme is based on three main textural feaiures: the aspect ratio of the fiammae, the degree of shards alignment and the style of crystallization of the matrix. All these features can be used to describe the ignimbrite units for the scope of their lithological characterization in mapping projects. We suggest that the scheme can have a general interest for the geological mapping of areas dominated by the presence of <b>welded</b> ignimbritic <b>units...</b>|$|R
