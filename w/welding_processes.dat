50|$|During the {{submerged}} arc <b>welding</b> <b>process,</b> not all flux {{turns into}} slag. Depending on the <b>welding</b> <b>process,</b> 50% to 90% of the flux can be reused.|$|R
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{shielding}} gas in arc <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen. A number of inert {{shielding gas}}es are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other <b>welding</b> <b>processes.</b> The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} meet the global {{competition}} and the survival of products in the market a new way of thinking is necessary to change and improve the existing technology and to develop products at economical price. It means not only to invest in procuring new equipments but also effectively control the process variables involved in any manufacturing process. These process variables must be measured, controlled and optimized to get the desired and valuable outputs. The typical process parameters for a <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> which affect the desired output for a <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> are <b>welding</b> speed, arc voltage, welding current etc. The <b>weld</b> <b>process</b> parameters vary for the different type of the <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> chosen.

40|$|The {{weldability}} {{using the}} electromagnetic {{process has been}} evaluated for different grades of polypropylene copolymers being used for automotive and domestic applications. As previous publications [1 – 2] have revealed, the electromagnetic <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> has demonstrated its robustness on various resins and applications. In this paper, comparative study between the vibration <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> and the electromagnetic <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> has been performed to evaluate effects of filler (talc and glass) content on weldability for polypropylene copolymers. Extensive DOE procedures to optimize the vibration <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> and electromagnetic <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> have been performed. In Ref.

5|$|The {{most common}} gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, {{also known as}} {{oxyacetylene}} welding. It {{is one of the}} oldest and most versatile <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E

The three involved phases (solid, liquid, gaseous) interact over their free moving phase boundaries. The existing boundary layer character allows to reduce the dimension of this Free Boundary Problem. The resulting welding model reproduces the time-dependent spatially 3 d-distributed <b>welding</b> <b>process.</b> The possibility to control predictively the <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> is investigated. The reproduction of thermal monitoring signals from the interaction zone between laser and material is approached...|$|R
40|$|During the {{high-power}} laser <b>welding</b> <b>process,</b> plasmas are {{induced by}} the evaporation of metal under laser radiation, which can affect the coupling of laser energy and the workpiece, and ultimately impact on the reliability of laser <b>welding</b> quality and <b>process</b> directly.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Currently, {{in order}} to {{suppress}} intermetallic reaction layer formation during dissimilar metals welding between steel/aluminum alloy, only laser beam welding as self-brazing technique has been applied. However, TIG <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> {{might be one of}} <b>welding</b> <b>process</b> candidate for joining dissimilar metals welding between steel/aluminum alloys due to its capability in joining thin section.

5|$|As {{with other}} <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> such as {{gas metal arc}} welding, {{shielding}} gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> {{require the}} use of a {{particular}} joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{austenitic}} stainless steel is becoming very important and widely used in the industry due to their superior properties.

5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many <b>welding</b> <b>processes</b> poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E

5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc <b>welding</b> <b>processes,</b> a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
