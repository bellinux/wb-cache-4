500|$|After {{the high}} levels of {{criticism}} aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures [...] "You know as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions." [...] The bill did not become law.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
2500|$|Cope regrets that he {{has allowed}} Amy {{to believe that he}} is {{prepared}} to marry her, having only tried to respond with tact when she pressed him. He has [...] "a crushing sense of his predicament"(196) and asks her to tell no one. In a letter, Arthur tells Cope he must end the engagement promptly: [...] "This thing can't go on, and you know it as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Nip it. Nip it now. Don't think that our intimacy is to end in any such fashion as this, for it isn't..."(197) ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Stephen laconically. 'She {{knew her}} mind <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> We {{are the same}} age. If you hadn't interfered----' ...|$|R

2500|$|Domingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca in a 1961 {{performance}} in Mexico City. A decade later, {{he made his}} Covent Garden debut in the role. He continued to sing the part for many years, especially at the Met and in Vienna, eventually performing it {{more than any other}} of his roles. In September 1975, Domingo debuted in the title role of Verdi's Otello at the Hamburg State Opera. It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times). He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, Laurence Olivier, declared after seeing the tenor in the role: [...] "Domingo plays Othello as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and he has that voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The first I {{have often}} told you. Considering myself {{sufficiently}} incongruous on my legal eminence, I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny. You know M. R. F., {{but not as}} <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> If you knew him as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> he would amuse you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, but his Excellency understands English perfectly, and I believe really {{he talks}} it as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> only he won't.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm no murderer," [...] gasped Bradling; [...] "you saw <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{that the}} fellow {{threatened}} to shoot me. Besides, {{he is not}} dead." ...|$|R
60|$|He knew <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that it {{was just}} as likely, at that time of year, I was going down there whaling; but I felt complimented, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you <b>did</b> about <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Dave," [...] was {{the modest}} rejoinder. [...] "But {{this is a}} prime haul, no use of talking. Mother will be tickled to death." ...|$|R
60|$|COMTESSE. What {{are you up}} to now, Miss Pin? You know as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{that there}} is no such speech.|$|E

6000|$|Sue, who was {{regarding}} the distance, {{had acquired a}} guilty look; and she suddenly replied in a tragic voice: [...] "I don't think I like you to-day so <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Jude!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time to get up, Sir. Bath ready, Sir," [...] {{he said in}} his jolly, drawling voice, {{pointing}} to a calabash full of hot water. [...] "Hope you slept <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Sir." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{officers}} {{laughed and}} took no more notice. They didn't know <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> how deep and fierce a hold heathendom still exercised over {{the minds and}} actions of these half-savage natives.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, Neb!--You {{know him}} almost as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> myself. He is yonder feeding the chickens, and will save his passage money." ...|$|E

60|$|The sheikh's English was a {{vanishing}} quantity, but {{to judge}} by the way he nodded and salaamed at this playful remark, I am convinced he understood the Doctor's Irish quite <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "Feel" [...] {{was written}} by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. According to Williams, most of the vocals are from the {{original}} demo recording, as he felt unsatisfied with the re-recorded vocals.

6000|$|Every man of my crew {{knew what}} that meant <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> As second officer in command, there could be but one reason for wanting me on board the Long-boat.

6000|$|... "Is that Master Ronaldson?" [...] he asked, in a thin, quavering tone. [...] "I've signed 'em, sir. Have yer {{brought the}} money?
