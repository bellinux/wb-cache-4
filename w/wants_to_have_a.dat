25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
25|$|Naomi and Liam {{start their}} {{relationship}} fresh. Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending fatherhood.

After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her.

500|$|Love {{has been}} candid about her diverse musical influences, the {{earliest}} being Patti Smith and The Pretenders, whom she discovered while in juvenile hall. As a teenager, she named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists, {{as well as}} several new wave and post-punk bands, such as Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Television, Bauhaus, and Joy Division. While in Ireland at age fifteen, she saw Virgin Prunes perform live in Dublin, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence. Her varying genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with Flipside, in which she stated: [...] "There's {{a part of me that}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> grindcore band and another that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Raspberries-type pop band." [...] Love also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Big Black, Diamanda Galás, the Germs, and The Stooges. While writing Celebrity Skin, Love was mainly influenced by Neil Young and My Bloody Valentine.

500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Hole drew {{inspiration}} from no wave and experimental bands, which is evident in their earliest recordings, specifically [...] "Retard Girl", but frontwoman Love also drew {{from a variety of}} influences. Love cited post-punk groups such as Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, and classic rock such as Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. The band's first album, Pretty on the Inside, was heavily influenced by noise and punk rock, using discordant melodies, distortion, and feedback, with Love's vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screams. Love described the band's earliest songwriting as being based on [...] "really crazy Sonic Youth tunings." [...] Nonetheless, Love claimed to have aimed for a pop sound early on: [...] "There's {{a part of me that}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> grindcore band and another that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Raspberries-type pop band," [...] she told Flipside magazine in 1991. Both Love and Erlandson were fans of the notorious LA punk band the Germs. In a 1996 interview for a Germs tribute documentary, Erlandson said: [...] "I think every band is based on one song, and our band was based on [...] "Forming"... Courtney brought it into rehearsal, and she knew, like, three chords and it was the only punk rock song we could play." ...|$|E

[...] Fletcher says {{that the lack of}} any explicit indication the song was about radio meant [...] "Panic" [...] "could be construed as reviving the racist and homophobic '' campaign of late 1970s America." [...] Scritti Politti's Green Gartside accused the song and the band of being racist.|$|E
