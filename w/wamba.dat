The species ranges from the Maiko forest northward to the Ituri forest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele and Ebola {{to the west and}} the Ubangi river further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo river. They are also common in the <b>Wamba</b> and Epulu areas. The okapi is extinct in Uganda.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} two legends {{associated}} with how <b>Wamba</b> became king.|$|E
25|$|One ambitious noble named Paul, {{who thought}} it would be an easy thing to take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly {{that he did not want}} it, rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. <b>Wamba</b> met him in battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul {{expected}} nothing less than to have his head stricken off, but <b>Wamba</b> simply ordered that it should be shaved.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, it was <b>Wamba's</b> nephew, son of {{his sister}} Ariberga, Ergica, who married Erwig's {{daughter}} and became the new king at his father in law's death.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he walked}} through the wood at a great pace, {{followed}} by the jester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with <b>Wamba's</b> humour to travel long in silence.|$|R
25|$|He {{was knocked}} out in round four by Nicolas <b>Wamba</b> at Fight Night Saint Tropez in Saint-Tropez, France on August 4, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Later {{an ambitious}} youth named Erwig, {{pursuing}} {{the overthrow of}} the king, administered a sleeping potion. While <b>Wamba</b> was under, Erwig shaved the crown of his head. As before, Gothic law was clear. <b>Wamba</b> could no longer be king. So he accepted this change and happily became a monk, abdicating the throne on October 14, 680, to live out the last seven years of his life in seclusion from the world (dying in 687). Erwig became king in his place.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 1999 {{tensions}} {{within the}} RCD about {{the dominance of}} the Banyamulenge reached a boiling point when RCD leader Ernest <b>Wamba</b> dia <b>Wamba</b> moved his base from Goma to Uganda-controlled Kisangani to head a breakaway faction named Forces for Renewal. A further sign of a break occurred when President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Kabila signed a ceasefire accord on 18 April in Sirte, Libya, following the mediation of Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi, but both the RCD and Rwanda refused to take part.|$|E

25|$|A {{period of}} peace {{followed}} and, in 674, <b>Wamba</b> rebuilt the Roman walls around Toledo. He also fortified other sites about this time, possibly Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), {{a small village}} in Spain facing the French border over the Txingurri bay, as a military thrust along the Bay of Biscay up to the Pyrenees is attested to in contemporary sources. <b>Wamba</b> brought the Astures and Ruccones (Luggones) under his control and incorporated them into a new province.

He received the order of penance in anticipation of his death, {{and as a result}} was forced to step down as king upon his recovery. The Chronicle of Alfonso III blames Wamba's successor Erwig for this; some modern commentators have blamed Julian of Toledo, who was made primate of the Visigothic church by Erwig (in reward for his services?). But Julian perpetuated the memory of <b>Wamba</b> in his account of the revolt of Paul, Historia Wambae Regís.|$|E
60|$|Cedric was no ready practiser {{of the art}} of dissimulation, {{and would}} at this moment have been much the better of a hint from <b>Wamba's</b> more fertile brain.

25|$|In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, {{written for}} the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is {{recorded}} about how, one day, when King <b>Wamba</b> (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) <b>Wamba</b> shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when <b>Wamba</b> arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused.|$|E
25|$|Thus it {{was that}} <b>Wamba</b> the husbandman first became king and {{afterwards}} monk. In all his stations—farmer, king, and monk—he acquitted himself well and worthily, and his name has come down {{to us from the}} mists of time as one of those rare men of whom we know little, but all that little good.|$|E
25|$|As <b>Wamba</b> {{moved on}} Narbonne, Paul placed General Wittimer {{in charge of}} the city and retired to Nîmes. Wamba's forces quickly subdued Narbonne and then, after some difficulty, secured the {{surrender}} of Nîmes on September 3, 673. Paul and the other rebel leaders surrendered and, three days later, were brought to trial, scalped, and imprisoned for life.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the period between 470 and 550, beyond the {{testimony}} of Isidore of Seville, who in the 7th century wrote that many kings reign during this time, all of them Arians.

25|$|The Legenda Aurea links {{him with}} Arles, but finally he withdrew {{deep into the}} forest near Nîmes, where in the {{greatest}} solitude he spent many years, his sole companion being a deer, or red deer, who in some stories sustained him on her milk. Giles ate a vegetarian diet. This retreat was finally discovered by the king's hunters, who had pursued the hind to its place of refuge. An arrow shot at the deer wounded the saint instead, who afterwards became a patron of cripples. The king, who by legend was <b>Wamba,</b> an anachronistic Visigoth, but who must have been (at least in the original story) a Frank due to the historical setting. He held the hermit in high esteem for his humility rejected all honors save some disciples. <b>Wamba</b> built him a monastery in his valley, Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, which Giles placed under the Benedictine rule. He died there {{in the early part}} of the 8th century, with the highest repute for sanctity and miracles.|$|E
25|$|Basankusu is an {{important}} staging post for conservation projects, for example, those relating to the bonobo.

25|$|The {{legend of}} the stick thrust into the ground is also {{associated}} with the town of Guimarães, southwest of Braga in the Costa Verde of Portugal (the northwest corner of the country). There, because <b>Wamba</b> never withdrew the stick afterwards, it is said it grew into an olive tree. Though the tree is now gone, the site is marked either by the monastery of Nossa Senhora da Oliveira (Our Lady of the Olive) or the Largo da Oliveira town square, each named for the legendary tree.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} tradition, however, has him {{born and raised}} in Pujerra (or Buxarra as it was once called) in the Málaga Province, an Andalusian {{mountain}} village, nestled amid forests of chestnut trees, near the Genal river in southern Spain.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second Congo War against the government of Laurent-Désiré Kabila, he was unanimously elected head of the rebel Rally for Congolese Democracy, which was backed by Uganda and Rwanda and based in the town of Goma. However, the RCD gradually tore in two from November 1998 until 16 May 1999, as it became clear that Rwanda and its supporters goals were limited to replacement of Kabila. Several attempts were made on <b>Wamba's</b> life during this period, coinciding with attempts to destroy his political power in the RCD.|$|R
50|$|He {{presided over}} several councils and synods and revised the Mozarabic liturgy. A voluminous writer, his works include Prognostics, a volume on death; {{a history of}} King <b>Wamba's</b> war with dux Paul in Septimania; and {{a book on the}} future life (687). He {{encouraged}} the Visigothic kings in Hispania to deal harshly with the Jews. For example, in presiding over the Twelfth Council of Toledo, he induced King Erwig to pass severe anti-Jewish laws. At Erwig's request, in 686, he wrote De Comprobatione Aetatis Sextae Contra Judaeos, a work dealing with messianic prophesies of the Bible in a way intended to convert the Jews.|$|R
25|$|This {{continuity}} led to {{the persistence}} of Galicia as a differentiated province within the realm, {{as indicated by the}} acts of several Councils of Toledo, chronicles such as that of John of Biclar, and in military laws such as the one extolled by <b>Wamba</b> which was incorporated into the Liber Iudicum, the Visigothic legal code. It was not until the administrative reformation produced during the reign of Recceswinth that the Lusitanian dioceses annexed by the Suevi to Galicia (Coimbra, Idanha, Lamego, Viseu, and parts of Salamanca) were restored to Lusitania. This same reform reduced the number of mints in Galicia from a few dozen to just three, those in the cities of Lugo, Braga, and Tui.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{started to}} change during the Late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages, when an Asturian identity gradually started to develop: the centuries-old fight between Visigothic and Suebian nobles may have helped to forge a distinct identity among {{the peoples of the}} Cantabrian districts. Several archaeological digs in the castro of La Carisa (municipality of Lena) have found remnants of a defensive line whose main purpose was to protect the valleys of central Asturias from invaders who came from the Meseta through the Pajares pass: the construction of these fortifications reveals a high degree of organization and cooperation between the several Asturian communities, in order to defend themselves from the southern invaders. Carbon-14 tests have found that the wall dates from the period 675-725AD, when two armed expeditions against the Asturians took place: one of them headed by Visigothic king <b>Wamba</b> (reigned 672-680); the other by Muslim governor Musa bin Nusayr during the Umayyad conquest, who settled garrisons over its territory.|$|E
25|$|Roman colonization, which {{occurred}} {{late in the}} Roman era, resulted {{in the establishment of}} private property and movement away from the forests, in addition to organizational changes resulting administrative, material and cultural evolution. Remnants of the Luso-Roman castro societies are evident in Castro of Sacóias and the Castro of Avelãs. In these excavations, modern archaeologists have discovered funerary remains, coins and implements. The Castro of Avelãs (about three kilometres from Bragança) was an important centre on the military road to Astorga, although there are many examples (in Alfaião, Aveleda, Carrazedo, Castro de Avelãs, Donai, França, Gostei, Meixedo, Pinela, Quintela Lampaças, etc.) of the Roman presence. The area was dominated by two ethnic communities: the Zoelae, with their seat in Castro de Avelãs, and a Lusitanian civitas under the stewardship of the Baniense {{in the southern part of}} the district. A Latin map, Atlas de Gotha by Justus Perthes, mentioned three settlements within this region: Aquae Flaviae (Chaves), Veniatia (Vinhais) and Zoelae (its seat in Zoelas, today Castro de Avelãs) without mentioning any reference to a name similar to Bragança. During Roman colonization, it was part of Gallaecia and dependent administratively on Astorga, on the Atlantic axis of a Roman highway from Meseta, that controlled the gold, iron and silver trade. The references to a settlement with the name similar to Bragança occurred in the acts of Council Lugo (569 AD) regarding the Vergancia. A similar reference by Visigoth King <b>Wamba</b> in 666 BC referred to Bregancia, and where, supposedly two Christian martyrs (John and Paul) were born.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a strong}} {{possibility}} that the Chronicle of 754 was written in Toledo (though scholars have also proposed Cordoba and Guadix) {{based on the information}} available to the chronicler. The chronicler showed awareness of the Historia Gothorum, the Etymologiae, and the chronicle of Isidore of Seville, the work of Braulio of Zaragoza, the acts of the councils of Toledo, De Perpetua Virginitate by Ildefonsus, and De Comprobatione Sextae Aetatis and Historia <b>Wambae</b> by Julian of Toledo, all works that would have existed in the Visigothic libraries of seventh century Toledo and whose existence together [...] "makes more sense in a Toledan context than in any other." ...|$|R
40|$|Bishop Julian of Toledo {{is remembered}} {{primarily}} as a key actor in the processes of king-making and -unmaking {{that went on in}} the Visigothic kingdom of the 670 s. In {{the early part of the}} decade Julian’s Historia <b>Wambae</b> Regis legitimated King <b>Wamba’s</b> hold on the throne in opposition to a rebellion. The text also provides us with the first reference to unction in the early medieval West, while Julian’s actions in putting the same king through penance when he appeared to be on the brink of death in 680 and then insisting that the king could not resume his royal duties when he recovered have long attracted the attention of scholars of penance and conspiracy theorists alike. As the Bishop of Toledo, capital of the Visigothic kingdom, Julian was the main ecclesiastic in Visigothic Spain, presiding over four councils of Toledo (from the twelfth in 681 to the fifteenth in 687). Perhaps as a result of his historical significance in a poorly documented era, Julian’s plentiful writings about the end of time have largely been ignored; after all, they seem not to deal with ‘historical’ events. This is a shame, since Julian’s Prognosticum futuri saeculi was the most widely disseminated work of late seventh-century Spain: hundreds of manuscripts survive and there are well over one hundred references to the work in medieval library catalogues. The great success of the Prognosticum can be attributed to the contents of the three books, which deal with the origins of human death, the fate of the soul after death and the fate of the body at the resurrection, and thus address a series of theoretical and practical issues connected to death and its aftermath. The text was so popular because it was very easy to use, briefly summarizing a wide range of patristic opinions on death, the second coming of Christ and its aftermath...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} preserved {{manuscript of}} the work dates to {{the first half of}} the thirteenth century. It was found in the late eighteenth century in San Isidoro in León, but was probably originally copied in Castile or La Rioja. It is now MS 9/4922 in the library of the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid. This manuscript contains many examples of early Spanish historiography: Isidore of Seville's Historia Gothorum, Julian of Toledo's Historia <b>Wambae,</b> the Chronicle of Alfonso III, the Chronica Naierensis, and royal genealogies. Several errors in the Historia Roderici indicate that this manuscript is a copy. Possibly it is the copy mentioned in a document of 1239 as being copied at the [...] in Carrión de los Condes in 1232/3 from an exemplar of the monastery of Nájera, but this cannot be proved.|$|R
