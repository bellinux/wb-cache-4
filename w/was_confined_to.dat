5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside.

Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres, {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, Russian and Turkish battleships skirmished, but nothing more.

And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault at Gallipoli.|$|E
