50|$|Both wet- and dry-barrel {{hydrants}} {{typically have}} multiple outlets. <b>Wet</b> <b>barrel</b> hydrant outlets are typically individually controlled, while a single stem operates all the outlets of a dry barrel hydrant simultaneously. Thus, <b>wet</b> <b>barrel</b> hydrants allow single outlets to be opened, requiring somewhat more effort, but simultaneously allowing more flexibility.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was educated}} in Pune and London, {{and worked at}} All India Radio until his death. His earlier {{collection}} of poems, Shishiragam (शिशिरागम), {{was a product of}} Ravi Kiran Mandal poetry: sentimental and lyrical. But his later avant-garde poetry brought about a storm in the Marathi literary world. His poem with the title [...] "पिपात मेले ओल्या उंदिर" [...] (Mice Died in the <b>Wet</b> <b>Barrel)</b> appeared in Abhiruchi (अभिरुची) magazine in 1946.|$|E
6000|$|It {{had been}} raining all the morning, so shallow pools of water lay about. A brewer's wagon, with <b>wet</b> <b>barrels</b> and warm-smelling horses, {{stood near the}} door of the inn. Everywhere seemed silent, but for the rattle of trains at the crossing. The two men went uneasily up the steps and into the bar. The place was paddled with wet feet, empty. As the bar-man was heard approaching, the uncle asked, his usual bluster {{slightly}} hushed by fear: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} rag from round the lock of the rifle, wiped the <b>wet</b> off the <b>barrel</b> {{with it and}} let it fall. Then I loosed the catch and by {{touching}} a certain mechanism, made the rifle hair-triggered. Now I looked again and began to make out things. There was the platform and there, alas! on it sat the toad-like Motombo. But his back was to me; he was gazing not towards the water, but down the cave. I hesitated for one fateful moment. Perhaps the priest was asleep, perhaps I could get the canoe away without shooting. I {{did not like the}} job; moreover, his head was held forward and invisible, and how was I to make certain of killing him with a shot in the back? Lastly, if possible, I wished to avoid firing because of the report.|$|R
5000|$|Finding a {{seemingly}} empty barn, {{he takes a}} nap in the loft. Soviet soldiers find him (and a hidden cache of Nazi food), so they take him to their commandant. The sympathetic commandant believes his story and lets him go, but tells him he needs permits from Dresden and Potsdam to transport raw materials between regions. Karl instead talks the captain in charge of supplies into giving him stamped written authorization and a cart for two barrels of carbide. Later, hunger overcoming his beliefs, he decides to go fishing using carbide (which explodes when it is <b>wet).</b> The first <b>barrel</b> he opens contains chalk, but the second has carbide. The explosion, however, results in suspicious Soviet troops taking him into custody again. Back {{he goes to the}} same commandant. This time, he trades the captain one more barrel for a 30-kilometre truck ride (Karl gives him the one with chalk inside). Along the way, they pick up first a middle-aged singer, then Karin, a teenage orphan in pigtails determined to go to America.|$|R
40|$|Background. Pelvic exenteration and multivisceral {{resection}} in colorectal {{have been}} described as a curative and palliative intervention. Urinary tract reconstruction in a pelvic exenteration is achieved in most cases with an ileal conduit of Bricker, although different urinary reservoirs {{have been described}}. Methods. A retrospective and observational study of six patients who underwent a pelvic exenteration and urinary tract reconstruction with a double <b>barreled</b> <b>wet</b> colostomy (DBWC) was done, describing the preoperative diagnosis, the indication for the pelvic exenteration, the complications associated with the procedure, and the followup in a period of 5 years. A literature review of the case series reported of the technique was performed. Results. Six patients had a urinary tract reconstruction with the DBWC technique, 5 male patients and one female patient. Age range was from 20 to 77 years, with a medium age 53. 6 years. The most frequent complication presented was a pelvic abscess in 3 patients (42. 85 %); all complications could be resolved with a conservative treatment. Conclusion. In the group of our patients with pelvic exenteration and urinary tract reconstruction with a DBWC, it is a safe procedure and well tolerated by the patients, and most of the complications can be resolved with conservative treatment...|$|R
