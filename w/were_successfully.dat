To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871.

5|$|After a {{month of}} preparation, just before he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg.

Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E
5|$|Caradoc, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in December 1915 as part of the 1915–16 War Programme. The ship was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Greenock {{shipyard}} on 21 February 1916. She was launched on 23 December 1916 and completed on 15 June 1917. She was assigned to the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet together with three other C-class cruisers. With her sister , she ran aground on Fair Isle on 15 August, but both ships <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> refloated.|$|E
5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four cars <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> {{overhauled}} for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price of the cars. Thirty-three more cars were overhauled in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E

The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> repelled.|$|E

Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E

Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes <b>were</b> <b>successfully</b> able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
