25|$|After the decision, he {{was criticized}} by others {{specifically}} online by netizens, saying that Pacquiao could not handle boxing together with basketball. Pacquiao {{said that even}} before he started boxing, he was also criticized {{that he can not}} be a world champion, but he proved them wrong, it served as a challenge for him and he dared his critics to wait until they see him step onto the court. 'It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.|$|E
500|$|Section 5 {{is based}} on Article 9 of the United Kingdom's Bill of Rights 1689: [...] "he [...] of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in [...] {{ought not to be}} impeached or {{questioned}} in any Court or Place out of [...]" [...] On the basis of this provision, and for other reasons, a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament. This is so even if the legal action is brought by, and not against, a member of the legislature. Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament's activities. In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd. (1994), the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances, members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> in Parliament. Therefore, members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely what they have to say.|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E

2500|$|The movie Airplane! and its sequel feature two inner-city African Americans {{speaking}} in heavily accented slang, which another character {{refers to as}} if it were a foreign language: [...] "Jive". [...] Subtitles translate their speech, which is full of colorful expressions and mild profanity, into bland standard English, but the typical viewer can understand enough of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> to recognize the incongruity.|$|E

2500|$|After {{they were}} signed to BBC Two, {{they became the}} hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC style series What Not to Wear in 2001, where they used their {{knowledge}} on fashion and harsh comments to reform the appearances and style of the participants on the show. The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> {{that by the time}} you have recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E

60|$|Mitchell's {{eyes met}} mine, and I {{have no doubt}} that mine showed just the same look of horror which I saw in his. Women say these things without thinking.

60|$|They canvassed their {{situation}} thus openly before the lady, convinced by the paleness of her look, her quivering lip, and dead-set eye, that she neither heard nor understood <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R
60|$|Coulthurst {{had spoken}} loudly, and as Sewell and Grace {{did not raise}} their voices it {{appeared}} probable {{that he could not}} hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> Sewell smiled as he glanced at the girl.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{all well}} enough," [...] Lionel agreed; [...] "but the {{question}} is, {{how are we}} to hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> inside?

6000|$|... "It doesn't {{sound at}} all like the native language," [...] said the girl, [...] "but there is {{something}} familiar about it. You know, every now and then I feel that I am just on the verge of understanding <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> or at least that somewhere I have heard their tongue before, but final recognition always eludes me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe," [...] I replied; [...] "but {{fortunately}} nobody understands them. I have noticed, myself, {{men standing}} on railway platforms and at street corners reading aloud from such books. Nobody knows what language they are speaking; nobody has the slightest knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> This is, perhaps, as well; were they understood {{they would probably}} be assaulted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the trouble}} has all blown over, I believe. Fulkerson," [...] said Beaton, with {{a return to}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "has managed the whole {{business}} very well. But he exaggerates the value of my advice." ...|$|R
60|$|He saw him turn to Irene and say {{something}} and her face sparkle as he often saw it sparkle at other people--never at himself. He tried to catch <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> but Aunt Juley was speaking.|$|R
60|$|From {{the voices}} and the steps there seemed {{now to be}} several people round me. I {{understand}} Italian a great deal better than I speak it, and I could make out very well <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R

"Pass {{your time}} in the streets and, when you see groups of people assemble, join {{yourself}} to them and gather <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> If it is ought that is {{important for me to}} know, come here and tell me or, if it be after I have departed for Tarichea, bring me the news there.

6000|$|... "Open the Austrian Mail-bag (FELLEISEN); see {{a little}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> over there!" [...] Such order had evidently been given, this night. In {{consequence}} of which, people wrote by Dresden, and not the direct way, in future; wishing to avoid that openable FELLEISEN. Next morning, January 6th, his Majesty had left for Ohlau,--early, I suppose; though there proved to be nothing dangerous ahead there, after all.|$|E
60|$|But {{who is this}} tall, {{commanding}} {{figure who}} rides beside them, his head bent as if listening to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> (he really isn't) while his eye alternately flashes with animation or softens to its natural melancholy? (In fact, we can only compare it to an electric light bulb with the power gone wrong.) Who is it? It is Jefferson C. Davis, President, as our readers will be gratified to learn, of the Confederate States.|$|E
60|$|Two {{men were}} {{approaching}} the warehouse, both tall, slim, and evidently of Spanish extraction. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> talking loudly and excitedly to one another; but as Larry understood but {{few words of}} Spanish, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> lost upon the boy.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{the next}} morning early, the two lads {{went down to the}} wharf. Presently they saw three young fellows, who were evidently Scotch by their dress and caps, talking together. They strolled up near enough to catch <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R
50|$|Evernham was a {{modified}} racer. When he was 26 years old, {{he was hired}} by the International Race of Champions (IROC) as a chassis specialist.

60|$|But {{the sympathy}} which we thus express with children, {{in order to}} be effectual, must be sincere and genuine, and not pretended. We must renew our own childish ideas and imaginations, and become for the moment, in feeling, one with them, so that the {{interest}} which we express in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> or doing may be real, and not merely assumed. They seem to have a natural instinct to distinguish between an honest and actual sharing of their thoughts and emotions, and all mere condescension and pretense, however adroitly it may be disguised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon! I forget myself. Only, {{it hurts}} me to see beauty {{in a place like}} this. It does not go well with that tune, and these voices, and these faces. Enjoy yourself, mademoiselle; drink it all in! See the way these people look at each other; what love shines in their eyes! A pity, too, we cannot hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> Believe me, their talk is most subtle, tres-spirituel. These young women are 'doing their bit,' as you call it; {{bringing}} le plaisir to all these who are serving their country. Eat, drink, love, for tomorrow we die. Who cares for the world simple or the world beautiful, in days like these? The house of the spirit is empty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} there is {{anything}} nearer at hand than the Hereafter," [...] he answered.

But of course it is not wise to put too much reliance upon words spoken by people at the last, because often they don't quite know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> Indeed sometimes I think this was so in the case of my own wife, who really seemed to me to talk a good deal of rubbish. Good-bye, I promised to see Widow Jenkins this afternoon about having her varicose veins cut out, and I mustn't stop here wasting time in pleasant conversation. She thinks just as much of her varicose veins as we do of the loss of our wives." ...|$|E
