5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> time. A lot of active {{students}} wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} the album <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already {{had in mind}} what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> period, but Honoré I {{was unable}} to remodel the {{fortress}} in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E

5|$|Under new Head Coach Wim Jansen, Celtic had to {{negotiate}} two qualifying rounds {{to qualify for}} the first round proper of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Welsh Inter Cabel-Tel were comfortably disposed of 8–0 on aggregate, but the next qualifying round against Tirol Innsbruck proved more difficult. An abysmal first leg performance in Austria was salvaged only by a late Alan Stubbs free kick, Celtic losing 21 on the night but netting a valuable away goal. The return match in Glasgow <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> see-saw affair. Celtic twice took the lead in the first half, only for Innsbruck to equalise on each occasion, their second goal an own goal by Henrik Larsson just before half-time. Goals in the second half from Simon Donnelly and Craig Burley put Celtic ahead on aggregate, but Gernot Krinner's header on 82 minutes levelled the tie on aggregate and gave the Austrians the advantage because of the away goals rule. But Celtic responded with three minutes to go, Wieghorst showed excellent skill in the penalty box to control Donnelly's knockdown before shooting in. With the match going into injury time and the tie poised on a knife-edge, Larsson went on a mazy run forward before passing to Burley who scored from close range to clinch a 63 win on the night to progress on aggregate. Celtic were then drawn against Liverpool in the first round proper.|$|E

25|$|Bebop {{differed}} drastically {{from the}} straightforward compositions {{of the swing}} era and was instead characterized by fast tempos, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate melodies, and rhythm sections that expanded on their role as tempo-keepers. The music itself seemed jarringly different to the ears of the public, who were used to the bouncy, organized, danceable tunes of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller during the swing era. Instead, bebop appeared to sound racing, nervous, erratic and often fragmented. But to jazz musicians and jazz music lovers, bebop <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> and beautiful revolution {{in the art of}} jazz..|$|E
25|$|Not {{that winning}} {{the race was}} easy. For this race the ABA {{abandoned}} its own commitment to the transfer system and not only had the Pros run the qualifying rounds in the cumulative scoring manner, i.e. racing {{three times in the}} qualifying motos and the pros with the eight lowest point scores transfer to the Main, but the Main was also cumulative, but not merely run three times but five. This greatly reduced the luck factor and awarded the most consistent. However what grated against the pros' nerves that basically just one race was deciding the number one pro for the year. Brian Patterson eventually one the car and the plate (and also winning the conventional pro AA Main and Pro Open as well), but hardly any pros thought it was fair, least of all Greg Hill and not even the winner, Brian Patterson. By any account it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> race for the season championship.|$|E

25|$|In the 2006–07 season, English sides {{dominated}} again. In {{a repeat}} of the 2005 semi-final, Liverpool knocked out Chelsea this time in a shoot-out. Chelsea won the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0 thanks to a goal by Joe Cole, but Daniel Agger levelled the aggregate scoreline at Anfield. Thus, the match went to penalties which Liverpool won 4–1, with keeper Pepe Reina saving twice. This was Chelsea's third semi-final defeat in four years. The first leg of the other semi-final between Milan and Manchester United, at Old Trafford, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> match with Cristiano Ronaldo opening the scoring, only for two Kaká goals to put Milan ahead 2–1 at half time. A Wayne Rooney brace in the second half gave United a 3–2 aggregate lead. The second leg at the San Siro, however, was a one-sided affair with Milan outclassing Man United from the start and winning 3–0 thanks to goals from Kaká, Clarence Seedorf and Alberto Gilardino, and thus setting up a revenge meeting with Liverpool in the final. Milan got their revenge as they won the final 2–1, two goals from Filippo Inzaghi proving to be the difference. Liverpool scored late on through Dirk Kuyt, giving the Reds hope of another amazing comeback but to no avail, and Milan were European champions for a seventh time.|$|E
25|$|The 1891 {{championship}} saw {{the novelty}} of Kerry contesting the All-Ireland final with Wexford. The game itself was the second game of a triple-header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This {{was followed by the}} All-Ireland furling final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry’s first point after five minutes with the team’s second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0-2 to 0-1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain John Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third half hour of hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All-Ireland final. Kerry {{went on to win the}} game by 2-3 to 1-5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland hurling title.|$|E

500|$|Linden {{was traded}} to the New York Islanders on February 6, 1998, for Todd Bertuzzi, Bryan McCabe, and the Islanders' third round choice (used to select Jarkko Ruutu) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.

The following year, his first full season in three years, Linden was second on the team with 47 points, and third with 18 goals; however, on May 29, 1999, the Islanders traded Linden to the Montreal Canadiens for a first round draft pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft (Branislav Mezei), for mostly financial reasons.
