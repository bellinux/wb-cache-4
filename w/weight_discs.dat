The inhibitor was purified 8. 4 -fold using boiling, dialysis and DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatographic steps. The inhibitor, IA, {{was found to}} be an unusually thermostable, nondialyzable protein which was not precipitable with trichloroacetic acid, and which adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose at pH 9 - 10, and CM-Sephadex at pH 6. 0. Elution of the inhibitor from DEAE – cellulose was accomplished with 0. 01 M Borax buffer, pH 9. 1, containing 0. 05 M NaCl. Sephadex G- 75 gel-filtration and SDS molecular <b>weight</b> <b>disc</b> electrophoresis suggest a molecular weight of about 13, 000 for IA. Digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, subtilisin and yeast carboxypeptidase demonstrated the inhibitor to be of protein nature. IA was found in the greatest concentration in the cytosol of the cell. Possible digestion of IA at pH 2. 5 by proteinase A was observed. Digestion of the inhibitor by yeast proteases at pH 6. 8 was clearly demonstrated. Lenney's report (6) of proteinase A activation in pH 5. 0, yeast autolysates was also confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis {{signaling}} through CD 95 (Fas/APO- 1) involves aggregation and clustering of the receptor {{followed by}} its actin-dependent internalization. Internalization {{is required for}} efficient formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with maximal recruitment of FADD, caspase- 8 / 10 and c-FLIP occurring when the receptor has reached an endosomal compartment. The first detectable event during CD 95 signaling is the formation of SDS-stable aggregates likely reflecting intense oligomerization of the receptor. We now demonstrate that these SDS-stable forms of CD 95 correspond to very high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>DISC</b> complexes (hiDISC) and are the sites of caspase- 8 activation. hiDISCs are found {{both inside and outside}} of detergent-resistant membranes. The formation of SDS-stable CD 95 aggregates involves palmitoylation of the membrane proximal cysteine 199 in CD 95. Cysteine 199 mutants no longer form SDS-stable aggregates, and inhibition of palmitoylation reduces internalization of CD 95 and activation of caspase- 8. Our data demonstrate that SDS-stable forms of CD 95 are the sites of apoptosis initiation and represent an important early step in apoptosis signaling through CD 95 before activation of caspases...|$|R

O presente trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a qualidade do processo de colheita mecanizada de cana-de-açúcar crua, utilizando o controle estatístico do processo (CEP), e a capacidade do processo gerar resultados dentro dos limites especificados, por meio da análise de capabilidade, quantificando as perdas e os danos causados às soqueiras pelo mecanismo de corte basal. O experimento foi conduzido em área de ARGISSOLO Amarelo, localizada no município de Arez – RN, sob dois tipos manejos do solo, no sistema convencional de preparo. Os tratamentos foram: AR+GM (arado de aivecas + grade média); GP+GM (grade pesada + grade média) e as perdas determinadas por meio de amostragem. Os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, toco e totais diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos estudados, sendo os maiores valores de perdas quantificados para o tratamento que utilizou o arado de aivecas seguido de grade média. O processo de colheita apresenta-se fora de controle para os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, cana inteira, cana-ponta, pedaço fixo, pedaço solto, lasca e estilhaço. O tratamento arado de aivecas seguido de grade média apresenta maiores graus de danos ocasionados às soqueiras, comparado ao tratamento (GP+GM). O tratamento (AR+GM) apresenta maior área de microrrelevo, diferindo estatisticamente do tratamento preparado com grade pesada seguida de grade média.

The experiment was conducted in an area of yellow clay soil located in the municipal of Arez, RN, Brazil, using two methods of managing the soil within the conventional system of preparation. The treatments were: (a) moldboard ploughs followed by average <b>weight</b> offset <b>disc</b> harrow and; (b) heavy offset disc harrow followed by average <b>weight</b> offset <b>disc</b> harrow, with the losses being determined through samples. The losses attributed to splinted stalks, pieces and stubble total differed statistically between the treatments studied, being that the highest values of quantified losses came from the treatment using moldboard ploughs followed by average <b>weight</b> offset <b>disc</b> harrow. The harvesting process proved unmanageable due to splinted stalks, whole cane, cane points, fixed pieces, loose pieces and splinters. The treatment using moldboard ploughs followed by average <b>weight</b> offset <b>disc</b> harrow presented the highest degree of damage to the stalks when compared to treatment (b).

40|$|Proteins {{from the}} axonemes and disc {{cytoskeleton}} of Giardia lamblia {{have been examined}} by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition to tubulin and the 30 X 103 molecular <b>weight</b> <b>disc</b> protein, at least 18 minor components copurify with the two major proteins in Triton-insoluble structures. The most prominent minor bands have the apparent molecular weights of 110 X 103, 95 X 103 and 81 x 105. Protein of 30 X 103 molecular weight accounts for about 20 % of organelle protein on gels. In continuous 25 mM-Tris-glycine buffer it migrates mostly as a close-spaced doublet of polypeptides, which are here given the name giardins. Giardia tubulin and giardin have been purified by gel filtration chromatography {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulphate. Well-separated fractions were obtained that could be further charac-terized. Both proteins are heterogeneous when examined by isoelectric focusing. Five tubulin chains were detected by PAGE Blue 83 dye-binding after focusing in a broad-range ampholyte gel. Giardin is slightly less acidic than tubulin. On gels it splits into four major and four minor chains with isoelectric points in the pi range from 5 - 8 to 6 - 2. The amino acid composition of the giardin fraction has been determined, and compared to Giardia tubulin and a rat brain tubulin standard. Giardins are rich in helix-forming residues, particularly leucine. They have a low content of proline and glycine; therefore they may have extensive cr-helical regions and be rod-shaped. As integral proteins of disc microribbons, giardins in vivo associate closely with tubulin. The properties of giardins indicate that in a number of respects- molecular size, charge, stoichiometry- their structural interaction with tubulin assemblies will be different from other tubulin-accessory protein copolymers studied in vitro...|$|R

40|$|In {{holometabolous}} insects, a species-specific size, {{known as}} critical weight, {{needs to be}} reached for metamorphosis to be initiated {{in the absence of}} further nutritional input. Previously, we found that reaching critical weight depends on the insulin-dependent growth of the prothoracic glands (PGs) in Drosophila larvae. Because the PGs produce the molting hormone ecdysone, we hypothesized that ecdysone signaling switches the larva to a nutrition-independent mode of development post-critical <b>weight.</b> Wing <b>discs</b> from pre-critical <b>weight</b> larvae [5 hours after third instar ecdysis (AL 3 E) ] fed on sucrose alone showed suppressed Wingless (WG), Cut (CT) and Senseless (SENS) expression. Post-critical weight, a sucrose-only diet no longer suppressed the expression of these proteins. Feeding larvae that exhibit enhanced insulin signaling in their PGs at 5 hours AL 3 E on sucrose alone produced wing discs with precocious WG, CT and SENS expression. In addition, knocking down the Ecdysone receptor (EcR) selectively in the discs also promoted premature WG, CUT and SENS expression in the wing discs of sucrose-fed pre-critical weight larvae. EcR is involved in gene activation when ecdysone is present, and gene repression in its absence. Thus, knocking down EcR derepresses genes that are normally repressed by unliganded EcR, thereby allowing wing patterning to progress. In addition, knocking down EcR in the wing discs caused precocious expression of the ecdysone-responsive gene broad. These results suggest that post-critical weight, EcR signaling switches wing discs to a nutrition-independent mode of development via derepression...|$|R

Here, we investigated several bee products for potential compound(s) that exhibit significant QS inhibitory (QSI) properties at the phenotypic and molecular levels in Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 {{as a model}} organism. Manuka propolis produced the strongest violacein inhibition on C. violaceum lawn agar, while bee pollen had no detectable QSI activity and honey had bactericidal activity. Fractionated manuka propolis (pooled fraction 5 or PF 5) exhibited the largest violacein inhibition zone (24. 5 ± 2. 5 mm) at 1 mg dry <b>weight</b> per <b>disc.</b> In C. violaceum liquid cultures, at least 450 µg/ml of manuka propolis PF 5 completely inhibited violacein production. Gene expression studies of the vioABCDE operon, involved in violacein biosynthesis, showed significant (≥two-fold) down-regulation of vioA, vioD and vioE in response to manuka propolis PF 5. A potential QSI compound identified in manuka propolis PF 5 is a hydroxycinnamic acid-derivative, isoprenyl caffeate, with a [M−H] of 247. Complete violacein inhibition in C. violaceum liquid cultures was achieved with at least 50 µg/ml of commercial isoprenyl caffeate. In silico docking experiments suggest that isoprenyl caffeate may act as an inhibitor of the violacein biosynthetic pathway by acting as a competitor for the FAD-binding pockets of VioD and VioA.

Although commonly observed, there is no widely accepted definition of hyperkyphosis in older persons, and other than vertebral fracture, no major causes have been identified. To identify important correlates of kyphosis and risk factors for its progression over time, we conducted a 15 -year retrospective cohort study of 1196 women, aged 65 years and older at baseline (1986 to 1988), from four communities across the United States: Baltimore County, MD; Minneapolis, MN; Portland, OR; and the Monongahela Valley, PA. Cobb angle kyphosis was measured from radiographs obtained at baseline and an average of 3. 7 and 15 years later. Repeated measures, mixed effects analyses were performed. At baseline, the mean kyphosis angle was 44. 7 degrees (SE = 0. 4, SD = 11. 9) and significant correlates included a family history of hyperkyphosis, prevalent vertebral fracture, low bone mineral density, greater body <b>weight,</b> degenerative <b>disc</b> disease, and smoking. Over an average of 15 years, the mean increase in kyphosis was 7. 1 degrees (SE = 0. 25). Independent determinants of greater kyphosis progression were prevalent and incident vertebral fractures, low bone mineral density and concurrent bone density loss, low body weight, and concurrent weight loss. Thus, age-related kyphosis progression may be best prevented by slowing bone density loss and avoiding weight loss. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R

40|$|Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. As a number of pirns can be wound from a single supply yarn package, pirns are wound from different yarn package diameters. A significant change in take off tension takes place from pirn to pirn. Placing dead <b>weights</b> on the <b>disc</b> tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent. However, incorrect timing of compensation and stepwise compensation may create significant tension variations in pirn windings. The authors attempted to design a tension control device by applying an automatically continuously varying electromagnetic force on the dead weight, so that the variation of take off tension due to change of package diameter is compensated and investigate influence of varying supply yarn package diameter on the fmal winding tens ion of pirn...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: An {{analysis}} {{of the variation in}} glycosaminoglycan, water content, and cell density with disc level in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the composition of the apical disc differed from that of adjacent discs in the same spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Compositional differences between the convex and concave sides of scoliotic discs have been noted and are thought to be secondary to altered loading. However, there is little information on changes relative to the apex. METHODS: Intact wedges of disc obtained during anterior fusion procedures were taken from 23 discs of 6 patients with neuromuscular scoliosis. Radial profiles of glycosaminoglycan, water content, and cell density were measured. Concentrations were compared at a standard distance (5 mm) into the disc and plotted versus spinal level. RESULTS: Glycosaminoglycan and water content were lowest in the outer annulus and increased steadily toward the disc center, whereas the cell density was highest in the outer 2 mm, fell steeply and then remained constant. At 5 mm from the annulus edge, cell density was lowest in apical discs and, in most cases, was noticeably higher in adjacent discs of the same spine. At the same point, there was no consistent change in glycosaminoglycan/dry <b>weight</b> from <b>disc</b> to disc, indicating no significant proteoglycan loss. However, glycosaminoglycan/tissue water, and therefore swelling pressure, was highest in the apical discs, suggesting that these discs were the most heavily loaded. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of cells from the disc at the curve apex probably arose because this disc experiences greater mechanical stress or is more deformed than its neighbors. The decrease in cell density was not associated with major changes in tissue composition, possibly because rates of degradation and of synthesis were reduced, leaving the matrix largely unchanged...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} globalization, the use of {{automotive}} vehicles {{becoming more and more}} general. An brake disc {{play an important role in}} the vehicle and it is used to stop or decrease the velocity of the vehicle. The demand of metal matrix composites is greatly increased in fabricating the brake disc since it having a low density and high thermal conductivity. Over-heating will lead to the malfunction of the braking system and affect the safety of vehicle. Low <b>weight</b> of brake <b>disc</b> can decrease the use of fuel of the vehicle thus improve the fuel usage efficiency. This project will proposed suitable material and focus more on selecting best alternative designs for a brake disc. A suitable hybrid Al-MMCs material is identified from the research journal and compared with the conventional material, grey cast iron. Then, the most important parameters and specifications that affecting the design of brake disc are determined from QFD. From the outcomes of QFD, six alternatives design of brake disc are proposed and modeled into CATIA. The model of brake disc are then imported to ANSYS software for structural and thermal analysis. Finally, a decision making tool, AHP is used to chose the best design among the six alternatives design of brake disc...|$|R
500|$|In August 1992, {{the group}} self-funded a seventrack self-titled {{extended}} play, {{also known as}} the Blue EP, on their own Finger label and distributed by MDS. It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane. The EP has an early version of [...] "Save Your Skin", co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Their second EP, Transfusion, was issued in September 1993, distributed by Polydor Records. At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were [...] "hoping the major label will put a bit of <b>weight</b> behind the <b>disc,</b> but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything". McKenzie felt the EP showed they were [...] "wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with?". The five tracks include [...] "Reap What You Sow", which reached the No.1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart, replacing Nirvana's [...] "Heart-Shaped Box". The group recorded their first music video, for [...] "Reap What You Sow"; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos. After the EP's success the group were signed by Polydor.|$|R
