40|$|WEEE (waste from {{electrical}} electronic equipments) {{comes under}} a special category of waste {{which is the}} result of industrialization and ever increasing demand of electronic <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> <b>in</b> <b>daily</b> life, with increasing usage waste production is also increasing. Now, the situation is alarming as a huge quantity of waste is generated by India as well as other countries. The condition of India is much worse because about 80 percent of the e- waste generated ion the u. s. is exported to India, china and Pakistan under the name charity. Only 3 % of the total e waste generated is recycled proper in India. The rest of it is handled by workers who work with bare hands, without makes under unhygienic conditions, informally recycling tons of e-waste for about 12 - 14 hours a day. It causes both environmental as well as health problems. Number of laws are framed but none is able to stop this informal recycling in this paper, National and International scenario along with hazards caused by e-waste and bit about its recycling...|$|R
