Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E

50|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is a {{class of}} modern processing techniques in which metals are first converted into a powder form, and then formed into the desired shape by heating below the melting point. This {{is in contrast to}} casting, which occurs with molten metal. Superalloy manufacturing often employs powder metallurgy because of its material efficiency - typically much less <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> must be machined away from the final product—and its ability to facilitate mechanical alloying. Mechanical alloying is a process by which reinforcing particles are incorporated into the superalloy matrix material by repeated fracture and welding.|$|E

This <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form consists of the fuel cladding (stainless steel or Zircaloy), noble metal fission products (e. g., Ru, Pd, Mo and Tc), and other metallic wastes. The main constituents of the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream are the cladding hulls (85 to 90 wt%); using the hulls as the dominant alloying component minimizes the overall waste volume as compared to vitrification or metal encapsulation. Two nominal compositions for the waste form {{are being developed}}: (1) stainless steel- 15 wt% zirconium for stainless steel-clad fuels and (2) zirconium- 8 wt% stainless steel for Zircaloy-clad fuels.

5000|$|Although Béjar did painting, {{handcrafts}} {{and even}} trades, {{he is best}} known for his sculpture, especially a class of sculpture called “magiscopios.” These were created with metal, glass, crystal, plastic and resins, [...] and feature crystals and lenses that distort the onlookers view. [...] He created the first of these with <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> and other scraps. After he created his first one, he invited Paco de al Maza, Justino Fernández, Salvador Novo and others for dinner. After seeing the work they thought about names with Jorge Hernández Campos coming up with “magiscopio.” When Béjar exhibited these magiscopios at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1966, he signified a break for a generation of avant garde sculptors, and from traditional Mexican sculpture. It created the idea of art as a game, essentially a leisure activity. The magiscopios brought Béjar fame and many of them were copied and reproduced; however, their popularity meant that no one wanted to see his paintings, which bothered him. The popularity also meant that he stopped making them from scraps, especially when he was hired as an artist-in-residence for Carburandum in the US, their first from Latin America. He signed a contract for five years which allowed him to work at their factory and work with larger pieces of materials. His last major completed work was a series of 120 magiscopios.|$|E
5000|$|Confusingly, the printmaking {{technique}} used in steel engravings is, after the earliest {{years in the}} 1820s, normally a combination of etching and true engraving, with etching becoming dominant in later examples, after the technique became popular in the 1830s. Engraving is done with a burin, which is a small bar of hardened steel with a sharp point. It is pushed along the plate to produce thin furrowed lines, leaving [...] "burr" [...] or strips of <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> to the side. This {{is followed by the}} use of a scraper to remove any burs, since they would be an impediment during the subsequent inking process. Steel plates are very hard for this technique, which is normally used on softer copper plates. So steel engraving also used etching (q.v.), where acid creates the lines in the plates in the pattern made by selectively removing a thin coating of acid-resistant ground by tools. This is much less effort. As well as etching needles, the etched part of steel engravings made great use of roulettes, small wheels mounted in handles which have regular sharp projections which produce broken lines of dots and dashes when rolled across the plate. Roulettes of different types were used together with the burin and needle to create densely packed marks which appear as tonal to the eye, and allow a great variety of textures and effects. True burin engraving was generally used to finish the etched image.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} suggests {{the use of}} <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> oxide materials {{for the removal of}} sulfur in hot gas streams as an alternative to either traditional calcium based sorbents, or regenerable metal oxide sorbents. When classified to a desired particle size and injected into a high temperature coal utilization process, such a ``once-through`` sorbent can effectively remove sulfur and simultaneously increase the permeability of dust collected at a downstream ceramic filter station in a highly cost effective manner. There is considerable technical and economic promise in the use of <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> oxides for the removal of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) and hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from coal gas streams containing these components, based upon results from tests under controlled laboratory conditions. Several <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> oxides, including the oxides of iron, tin, and zinc, have been evaluated both individually and in combination to assess their capacity for sulfur capture in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. Additionally, inert materials such as silica sand as well as more traditional materials such as dolomite and limestone, were evaluated as sorbents under identical test conditions to serve as reference data. Efforts also explored the overall domestic availability of the best performing <b>waste</b> <b>metal</b> oxide sorbents, taking into account their geographic distributions, intrinsic value, etc. to provide the groundwork for commercial implementation of a low cost, highly effective sulfur sorbent for eventual use in both coal combustion and coal gasification processes.

Findings – The results of this study establish that the ecological impact from <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> management is mainly due to the burning of diesel from machinery during the dismantling processes and the use of vehicles for transportation. The results proposed equations and curves for estimating the ecological cost from <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> based on waste management strategies.
