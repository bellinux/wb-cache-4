5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E

In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E

5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia today was {{inhabited}} throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> was discovered include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.|$|E

Despite her character having been introduced as fair minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians.

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was {{appointed}} musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor, but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them. Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence. He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss, in <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> he conducted Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the fighting around Finschhafen and the defeat of the Japanese counterattack, the Allies began preparing for a concerted assault on the Japanese main defensive position around Sattelberg. In the wake of the Japanese counterattack, the members of the Australian and American staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved {{in the form of the}} 26th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead, as well as a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion– <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> the Australians sought to keep secret for as long as possible– which were landed at Langemak Bay.

The 2/13th Field Company supplied engineer detachments to each battalion, while air assets were provided by the United States 5th Air Force and No. 4 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, which was an Army co-operation squadron that was equipped with Boomerangs and Wirraways, and provided aerial observation in support of artillery operations. Vengeance dive bombers from No. 24 Squadron, RAAF also provided support, while Japanese supply lines were disrupted by Allied aircraft and PT boats.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.|$|E

Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> had upset Fischer.

When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do.

5|$|Through his {{paternal}} family, Filitti {{descended from}} historical figures whose careers were {{intertwined with the}} history of Wallachia, the Romanian subregion and former autonomous state. It originated with ethnic Greek migrants from the Epirus—where the Filitti family was known to be residing in the 17th century. The main settlers were male monks, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> was attested in Buzău County around 1786: rising through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Dositei Filitti served as Wallachian Metropolitan Bishop, assigning nephew Constandie to preside over the Diocese of Buzău. Although his Epirote father was a noted Russophile, the Metropolitan regarded himself as a liberal-minded Wallachian patriot: he founded the local school of divinity, provided scholarships to young Wallachians, and sponsored the growing printing industry. In tandem, he spoke out against the practice of slavery, protecting Romani women from their Wallachian masters and donating money for the release of devșirme victims. During times of turmoil, when Wallachia effectively became a dominion of the Russian Empire, Dositei was swiftly deposed on Russian orders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E

5|$|Remnants {{of several}} Neolithic and Chalcolithic {{cultures}} {{were found in}} all regions of Croatia, {{but most of the}} sites are found in the river valleys of northern Croatia, including Slavonia. The most significant cultures <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> was found include the Starčevo culture whose finds were discovered near Slavonski Brod and dated to 6100–5200BC, Vučedol and Baden cultures. Most finds attributed to the Baden and Vučedol cultures are discovered in the area around Vukovar, extending to Osijek and Vinkovci. The Baden culture sites in Slavonia are dated to 3600–3300BC, and Vučedol culture finds are dated to 3000–2500BC. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture. Much later, the region was settled by Illyrians and other tribes, including the Pannonians, who controlled much of present-day Slavonia. Even though archaeological finds of Illyrian settlements are much sparser than in areas closer to the Adriatic Sea, significant discoveries, for instance in Kaptol near Požega have been made. The Pannonians first came into contact with the Roman Republic in 35 BC, when the Romans conquered Segestica, or modern-day Sisak. The conquest was completed in 11 BC, when the Roman province of Illyricum was established, encompassing modern-day Slavonia as well as a vast territory on the right bank of Danube. The province was renamed Pannonia and divided within two decades.|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{first met}} in London on 9 September 1936 and was {{attended}} by representatives of solely European countries, and did not include Switzerland (whose policy of neutrality prohibited even inter-governmental action). It was chaired by W. S. Morrison, Britain's Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The meeting was concerned mostly with procedure only. Charles Corbin represented the French, Italy by Dino Grandi, and the Soviets were represented by Ivan Maisky. Germany was represented by Ribbentrop (with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy) but left the running to Grandi, although they found working with him difficult; Portugal, <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> had been a Soviet requirement, was not represented. There was little hope in the committee, since the British and French would {{have been aware of}} the continued shipment of arms to the Nationalists from Italy and Germany. Britain protested twice to the Italians, once in response to Italian aircraft landing in Majorca, the other pre-emptively over any significant change in the Mediterranean. Stanley Baldwin, British prime minister, and Blum attempted to halt global exports to Spain, believing it in Europe's best interests. Soviet aid to the Republic was threatened in the Committee. It began once it was clear the Non-Intervention Agreement was not preventing Italian and German aid to the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June, {{a letter}} arrived from William Tayler, the {{commissioner}} of Patna district, warning that an outbreak of mutiny from the Bengal Native Infantry units in Dinapore was to be expected. The European population in Arrah spent {{that night at the}} house of Arthur Littledale, a judge working in Arrah, and during the night it was decided that the European women and children were to be sent by boat to Dinapore, escorted by armed members of the European male population, where they would be taken into the care of the 10th Regiment of Foot—this decision was acted upon on the 9th. The following morning a meeting was held at the house of Herwald Wake, the magistrate of Shahabad district, to discuss what to do next. The East India Company civil servants stated that they did not intend to abandon the town and they would remain. All but two of the remaining European male residents of Arrah who were not civil servants or Government employees decided to leave for the relative safety of Dinapore by boat or on horseback and did so the same day. This reduced the European male population of Arrah to eight, rising to sixteen {{over the next few weeks}} as men arrived in the town from the surrounding district. The defence of the town was augmented on 11 June when a party arrived consisting of 50 sepoys and 6 sowars from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, known as Rattray's Sikhs (now the 3rd Battalion of the Sikh Regiment, Indian Army), under the command of Jemadar Hooken Singh. The party had been sent from Dinapore, part of a larger detachment under their commander Captain Rattray <b>whose</b> <b>presence</b> in the area had been personally requested by Tayler, and placed under the direct command of Wake.|$|E
