5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
500|$|In 1654, Oliver Cromwell {{decided to}} turn on Spain (which {{had been the first}} state to {{recognise}} the Commonwealth of England) and seize the island of Hispaniola to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over Jamaica instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off Cádiz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare war on England until February 1656. Shortly after, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar. Although they lacked a viable landing force and took no action, Oliver Cromwell expressed interest in its capture: [...] "if possessed and made tenable by us, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> both an advantage to our trade, and an annoyance to the Spaniards, and enable us ... ease our own charge?" [...] In 1693, during the Nine Years' War, in which Spain and England were allies, the remnants of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke took refuge at Gibraltar, pursued by the French, after losing the Battle of Lagos Bay. Eleven years later, Rooke was to return to Gibraltar to capture it.|$|E

2500|$|Adam Smith {{is remembered}} by lay persons {{as the father}} of capitalism, but his Theory of Moral Sentiments of 1759 also {{attempted}} to strike out a new ground for moral action. [...] His emphasis on [...] "sentiment" [...] was in keeping with the era, as he emphasized the need for [...] "sympathy" [...] between individuals as the basis of fit action. These ideas, and the psychology of David Hartley, were influential on the sentimental novel and even the nascent Methodist movement.

2500|$|... for {{a country}} such as Romania, {{it is obvious that}} the urban working class' fate is {{literally}} in the hands of the rural working class. In these conditions, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> an act of suicide from the industrial working class of Romania if it were to adopt a hostile attitude toward the peasantry?And: it is obvious that, no matter what the political and social doctrine preached by the urban proletariat, it would become hostile toward the peasantry if it wanted to impose upon it a form of economic structuring rejected by the peasantry, such as, for one, the immediate and violent socialization of peasant agriculture.A socialist worker expresses, in the pages of , the fear that the Peasants' Party of Romania will follow the example of the peasant parties in Bulgaria and Serbia , who, once in power, are said to have oppressed the workers.But can this serve as an argument against the solidarity in interests of the workers in villages and cities?In these murky times, we have also assisted to the spectacle of bloody repression, by a socialist government , of the workers' movements in Germany.Does this mean that there is a real conflict of interests between those elements of the German proletariat that are being led by the orthodox Social Democracy, and the elements that follow the banner of the Independent Party?" ...|$|E
