5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with a 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a}} while you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Monitor was now a premier tourist attraction and the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel. During this time the vessel was picked clean of artifacts for souvenirs by the touring civilians that came aboard. When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted, When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> to clean that night there was not a key, doorknob, escutcheon – there wasn't a thing that hadn't been carried away.|$|E

Williams said, [...] "We always wanted to do a rival show, and I think we tried to do a rival show for SpongeBob, and it wasn't working. So <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band. I was not in a band, but I think maybe Doug [...] was in a band.

500|$|On February 13, 1945, Dresden {{became the}} target of Allied forces. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce firebombing of the city. The {{offensive}} subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled {{at the level of}} both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. [...] "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> the city was gone... They burnt the whole damn town down." [...] Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble. He described the activity as a [...] "terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt".|$|E
500|$|... "Miracle Man" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The X-Files written by Howard Gordon {{without the aid of}} his {{long-term}} collaborator Alex Gansa. The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard came to my house, and said, 'Help me out,' so we went to my living room and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E
500|$|Fairport Convention {{had been}} invited to Bob Dylan's London music {{publishers}} to hear then-unreleased tracks from The Basement Tapes sessions. The band's bassist, Ashley Hutchings, said [...] "We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could." [...] In the event, versions of [...] "Percy's Song", [...] "Million Dollar Bash" [...] and [...] "If You Gotta Go, Go Now" [...] (retitled [...] "Si Tu Dois Partir") were used on the album. The French lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the Middle Earth Club. According to guitarist Simon Nicol: [...] "I think the boredom factor {{was one of the reasons}} <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night." [...] "Percy's Song" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bash" [...] had never been released before.|$|E

500|$|Charles Cecil and Tony Warriner {{had worked}} {{together}} at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990, {{they decided that}} they would {{set up their own}} video game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: [...] "While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a – let’s be frank – fairly unlikely series of events. It was all a little bit twee. So <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the idea of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story – something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra." [...] The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Konietzko {{announced}} {{the return of}} KMFDM in early 2001, due to [...] "public demand", with Skold, Cifarelli, and former collaborators Watts and Rieflin joining him in the studio; {{he said at the}} time, [...] "I talked with the usual KMFDM suspects to see if they were interested, and what <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with was something better than what we had before." [...] Recalled Esch in 2009, [...] "I was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so I refused the concept of a fast reunion of the original KMFDM." [...] Konietzko said of the reformed band, [...] "Not only is it fun again, but it's devoid of all the personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of the band," [...] but said, [...] "I really miss En Esch," [...] in 2003. KMFDM released its first album in three years, Attak, in March 2002. The album was on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at No.11.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. [...] "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off. I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with {{a few things that}} [...] really, really a solid body of work".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E

500|$|Rare {{decided to}} make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. Kazooie was later {{conceived}} during the planning of such abilities. According to Mayles, [...] "We {{came up with the}} [...] idea that a pair of wings could appear from his backpack to help him perform a second jump. We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [...] we added a pair of 'fast-running' legs that appeared {{from the bottom of the}} backpack. [...] <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo's backpack." [...] The character was named after a kazoo, which was considered an annoying instrument, [...] "much like the personality of the bird", Mayles explained. Instead of actual dialogue, all the characters in the game feature [...] "mumbling" [...] voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech [...] "could ruin the player's perception of the characters." [...] The witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the Grotbags British television series.|$|E
500|$|... "Power Hungry" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which {{would go on to}} write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through kneading that idea over and over again, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> {{with the idea of a}} character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, Hubbard {{identified}} the realistic expectations {{set by the}} team as a strong point in the game's development, saying that [...] "given our budget, team size, and development cycle, {{the best we could}} hope to do was to create a fun, engaging 60s espionage game that would make up in presentation what it lacked in innovation." [...] Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement, along with the flexible systems used in development, the cohesion of the team, and effective scheduling. On the other hand, Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team, as well as inefficient pre-production, delays due to waiting on technology, and the major difficulties in finding a publisher. Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic, partly because of technical difficulties, and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf, with regard to screenwriting. Regarding gameplay, he said that [...] "ne of the main failings of NOLF [...] was that it ended up feeling a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be". Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue: [...] "Unfortunately, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> a little short on intrigue. Stealth was too unforgiving. Once you were spotted, you were playing an action game." [...] The team paid attention to these points while developing No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E
