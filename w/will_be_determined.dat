5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, although each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can send less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

It is essentially a conflicts of laws measure, and generally leaves member states free to determine the content of their own insolvency proceedings and priorities.
