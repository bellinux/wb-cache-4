In this paper, we ask under what circumstances do people pay attention to outcomes {{and under what circumstances}} do they focus on intentions. While the aphorism in the paper’s title suggests that outcomes play a larger role than intentions, our study questions this assumption. Some previous studies in economics suggest that the process determining an outcome affects responses to that outcome. Our experimental design improves upon previous methodology by introducing an element of chance in the wage-determination process in an experimental labor market. Using this device, we find that both intentions and outcomes matter; rates of punishment and reward are sensitive to both the wage a firm decides to pay and the (higher or lower) wage actually received after chance intervenes. We feature a specific comparison, in which workers receive identical wages either (1) after a high <b>wage</b> <b>assignment</b> and bad luck, or (2) after a low <b>wage</b> <b>assignment</b> and good luck. Despite identical wages and identical relative payoffs, workers’ responses differ greatly across these contingencies. Our data strongly support the role of intentions, with negative reciprocity overwhelming distributional considerations given low wages...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that, despite high interest rates, wage earners {{in the early}} twentieth century frequently obtained credit from retail shops, from loan sharks, and from the emerging formal consumer credit market. When wage earners defaulted, the options for collection available to their creditors were governed by state laws on garnishment and <b>wage</b> <b>assignment.</b> These important laws varied widely from state to state, and little is known about their origins or evolution. In Illinois, the law put significant restrictions on creditors in the late nineteenth century, but the restrictions were removed in the first quarter of the twentieth century. This article shows how this dramatic shift resulted from the interaction of legislative and judicial activity and was driven by both interest group politics and judicial action. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study first {{reviews the}} 1971 NCCF {{findings}} on {{the economic impact of}} creditors ' remedies. 1 Then it develops an alternative model of the personal loan markets that recognizes that competition may occur among credit unions, banks, and finance companies as well as among members of each group. It uses the NCCF study data to determine what impact creditors ' remedies have in the-alternative model. Finally, it summarizes the similarities and differences in the findings of the two studies. Overall, the findings are highly similar. Both studies suggest that many restrictions on creditor remedies are likely to reduce personal loan credit availability (per capita) and, to a lesser extent, increase personal loan finance rates. In particular, both studies found evidence that prohibitions against attorney's fee clauses were significantly associated with reductions in finance company personal loan credit and that restrictions on wage assignments reduced credit union credit. In supplementary studies of personal loan extensions, Greer also found that <b>wage</b> <b>assignment</b> restrictions were associated with reduced commercial bank and credit union personal loan extensions and that restrictions on garnishment significantly affected the price and availability of consumer credit. Using data on consumer loan outstandings, this study reinforced the garnishment results by indicating that restrictions on garnishment significantly reduced finance company and commercial bank credit outstandings per capita, and that prohibitions against garnishment were associated with significantly elevated financ...|$|E

Because schools do not compete on <b>wages,</b> teacher <b>assignments</b> are differentiated by non-monetary characteristics.

No wage differences across jobs should, all else equal, decrease the search rate of teachers. Seniority-based transfer rules should lead to a positive relationship between experience and search (and transfer) rate. More experienced teachers should move to schools with better non-monetary characteristics.|$|R

30|$|As with {{fixed-term}} employment, temporary agency {{work has}} also been increasingly liberalised over the last decades, with the most important deregulatory step being taken in 2003 {{in the context of}} the Hartz reforms. Here, virtually all restrictions regarding agency work, such as the maximum duration of assignments, the ban on synchronicity between employment contract and individual assignments or the ban on rehiring, were lifted. At the same time, equal pay and equal treatment were stipulated as a general principle. However, deviations were allowed for initial periods of employment after phases of unemployment and, most importantly, by way of collective agreements. This led to virtually full coverage of the agency sector by collective agreements—however, the wages set are now significantly below those of major user sectors such as the metal working sector. Therefore, while the original intention of promoting temporary work agencies was to strengthen the placement capacities for the unemployed, contradictions, largely due to differing <b>wage</b> scales and <b>assignments</b> that can be made for an indeterminate period of time, in labour market reforms in Germany actually led to the creation of a peculiar wage gap between direct employees in manufacturing and {{temporary agency work}}ers performing similar tasks.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters focusing on negative reciprocity, transparency and job assignment, and overconfidence. To test my hypotheses I use experimental economics methods, which offer control over the data generating process by motivating people financially. Experimental methods are used to identify causal processes and motivations that can be confounded in field settings. Economics experiments reduce response noise, e. g. extreme outliers probably caused by thoughtless, unmotivated subjects (Smith and Walker, 1993). The central theme of my first two experiments is reciprocity – a kind reaction to kind and generous behaviour and retaliation to hostile behaviour. The first chapter discusses reciprocity in connection with violation of the property rights {{and the source of}} the endowment on an individual level. In the second chapter the reciprocity is studied in an employer-worker setting, in the presence of social comparisons. The last chapter deals with firm’s overconfidence when deciding about entering the market. All of the chapters study aspects of economic behaviour in social contexts, which have implications for the field. Each of the chapters is described briefly below. My first chapter experimentally explores the impact of the strength of property rights on retaliation decisions. I induce strong property rights by having experimental subjects earn money by performing a real effort task and weak property rights by endowing them with windfall gains. I ask whether people are less likely to respond to a hostile behaviour with retaliation when earned money as opposed to windfall money is at stake. My experimental design identifies two reasons why property rights might influence the size and frequency of retaliation. The first reason is that retaliation might be perceived to be more costly when using earned as opposed to windfall money to pay for retaliation. The second reason is related to the violation of property rights. If another person decreases a decision-maker’s endowment and the endowment {{consists of}} earned money rather than windfall money, the decision-maker might consider it to be a stronger violation of his property rights, which in turn could trigger stronger retaliation. The purpose of this experiment is to separate these two effects. While I find support for the fact that subjects retaliate more because of the violation of their property rights, I also find that participants actually retaliate more with their earned money than with windfall. This suggests that participants do not perceive such retaliation to be more costly but rather that their behaviour is driven by violation of property rights. The second chapter focuses on the fairness perceptions of the job assignment process in an employer-worker relationship. In reality, employers have at their disposal jobs of different importance, which have to be assigned to different workers. Workers in more important jobs usually get offered higher wages and workers in less important jobs get offered lower wages. If the interpersonal concerns were absent, the employer would provide a higher wage to the worker in the more important job. When a worker decides what wage to accept, he may compare his wage to the other workers’ wage. An employer anticipating this might adjust the wage policy in order to avoid unnecessary losses or to maximise profits. I experimentally study the fairness perceptions from the workers’ and the employer’s point of view. I ask the following questions: 1. Do workers react to the wages paid to their co-workers and does the job assignment procedure affect workers’ wage rejections? 2. Do employers react to the fact that workers compare themselves with their co-workers and do they compress wages when the job assignment procedure is perceived less fair? These questions have implications for labour market, in particular a firm’s wage policy. If an unfair <b>assignment</b> elicits more <b>wage</b> rejections (i. e. zero profit for the employer and zero wage for the worker) due to social comparisons, it can have detrimental effects on the performance of the firm and thus firms might choose to practice wages secrecy. I examine the impact of job assignment in the presence of social comparisons. In order to test for social comparisons, the worker is only informed about the wage that the employer offered to his co-worker and which job he has been assigned to. Only after workers state their minimum acceptable offers, which determine if the offered wage is accepted or rejected, they come to know their own wage. I posit that a worker’s reaction to a specific job assignment depends on the procedure by which they are allocated to the jobs. An assignment to a less important job will not be perceived as unfair if it arises from an unbiased procedure, for example random assignment with equal probabilities. It will, however, be perceived as unfair if workers think that the employer favours some workers over others for reasons that are unrelated to efficiency concerns. This experiment does not provide evidence on social comparisons or employers compressing <b>wages</b> when the <b>assignment</b> to jobs is perceived unfair. My third chapter is a replication of the high-impact overconfidence and excess entry experiment by Camerer and Lovallo (1999). The topic of overconfidence is crucial for understanding business failures. Camerer and Lovallo were first to directly test overconfidence by measuring economic decisions and personal overconfidence at the same time. Camerer and Lovallo test whether managers’ overconfidence about their skills could predictably influence economic behaviour when entering into markets. I implemented Camerer and Lovallo’s experiment with modifications reflecting the technological progress of economic experiments of past 15 years. While Camerer and Lovallo run their experiment with male participants (who {{have been shown to be}} more overconfident than females), my experiment studies the effect of overconfidence of both genders, making it a more conservative test. The thesis employs cutting edge techniques from Experimental Economics to study economic decision-making. My research provides empirical evidence on violation of property rights, fairness considerations in labour markets and impact of overconfidence on market entry decisions...|$|R
