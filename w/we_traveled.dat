500|$|Udell {{recorded}} {{that the}} Rose–Baley Party left Albuquerque on June 26 and began crossing the Rio Grande on a ferry. Three days later, {{as the last}} of their outfit crossed, one of Rose's men, Frank Emerdick, drowned in the river. Baley notes that they traveled for the next five days and, because there were no suitable campsites nearby, did not stop to celebrate Independence Day, as would most westbound emigrants. On July 5, they reached the Zuni Mountains, a branch of the Rocky Mountains; two days later they traversed the Continental Divide of the Americas, which, although [...] to [...] feet in elevation, was a relatively easy passage. Udell described the road as [...] "smooth and fine, <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> it in a day with our ox teams, and no hard labor." [...] On July 7, they camped near El Morro National Monument, then called Inscription Rock, and several members of the party, including Rose and Udell, carved their names into stone– a tradition dating back to 1605. Their inscriptions indicated that they were aware of being the first emigrants in the region.|$|E

2500|$|Amber Milton Yeary, II (born 1938), a Laredo businessman, civic leader, Southern Baptist layman, and {{a former}} 25-year LISD board member, {{described}} his friend Treviño as [...] "a man of integrity and character {{with a passion for}} his life's work, totally dedicated to the children and his community. <b>We</b> <b>traveled,</b> argued, and agreed together. It will {{be a long time before}} we know another one like Vidal Treviño." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{were now}} come more than half-way {{from sea to}} sea, and we {{were still in the}} thick of Europeanization. So far <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> in the track of the comic. For if Japan seems odd for what it is, it seems odder for what it is no longer.|$|R
2500|$|Each summer, Hines toured {{with his}} whole band for three months, {{including}} through the South – {{the first black}} big band to do so. He explained, [...] " [...] <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car {{to let us know}} when the dining room was cleared, and then we would all go in together. We couldn't eat when we wanted to. We had to eat when they were ready for us." ...|$|E

"No," [...] I replied, [...] "now <b>we</b> have <b>traveled</b> to Edinburgh, <b>we</b> {{will see}} {{something}} (interesting {{to me at}} any rate) which we should never have seen {{if we had not}} left London. My husband's country-house is within a few miles of us here. To-morrow--we will go to Gleninch." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus it {{was that}} Uncle 'Rasmus went off by himself, going down past the line of grape-vines across the creek, as I supposed, while we three struck out along the road until <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> perhaps {{a quarter of a}} mile, when little Frenchie {{suddenly}} halted and said as he turned upon us: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{furnished}} it suitably," [...] said Mr. Dusante. [...] "We had {{books and}} music, {{and for several}} years we passed vacations there which were both enjoyable and profitable.

60|$|We {{made the}} journey in a {{comfortable}} railway carriage, through a country which, as <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> farther toward the east, showed increasing evidence of prosperity and wealth.|$|E
60|$|We {{knew the}} volunteers would begin the journey {{as soon as}} day broke, {{therefore}} within an hour, if <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> at our best pace, {{it should be possible}} to hail the foremost craft.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will," [...] I answered, {{thrusting}} {{back the}} wide-brimmed hat as I looked at him. [...] "The last time <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> together {{you were not}} so accommodating. We had a little dispute at Elktail one night in the snow." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{contemplate}} {{aspects of}} a journal which experiences what we call "adolescence process" is indeed challenging. <b>We</b> have <b>traveled</b> paths, sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, in which we advocate that if a seed is thrown into fruitful soil, the results certainly will present as productive.

"It {{seems that}} however highly we value ourselves, and {{whatsoever}} of importance we may attach to carrying {{a message from}} Doctor Warren to Colonel Barrett, no one else appears to be of our opinion. I had not thought they would kill a fatted calf for us {{as if we were}} Prodigal Sons; but surely some one might have asked, knowing <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> all night, whether or no a bit of corn bread would go amiss." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{conversation}} on the drive began with the subjects of agriculture and breeding. I displayed my total ignorance of crops and cattle before <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> ten yards on our journey. Ambrose Meadowcroft cast about for another topic, and failed to find it. Upon this I cast about on my side, and asked, at a venture, if I had chosen a convenient time for my visit The young farmer's stolid brown face instantly brightened. I had evidently hit, hap-hazard, on an interesting subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two packers," [...] replied Gladwyne. [...] "There {{were no more}} {{available}} at the last settlement. Batley has {{a list of the}} provisions--we cut them down as much as possible. As we were anxious to overtake you, <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> light." ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{half mile}} or so we passed a ranch house, and as <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> on these ranches grew further apart, until, twelve or fifteen miles out of Sanderson, they were so widely {{separated}} that each appeared alone on the wild range.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} was quite natural, sir; the pistols {{were presented to}} us by some people <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> with once; we took the plates off because they made a great fuss about nothing, and we {{thought that it would}} look cockey." ...|$|E
60|$|Either <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> in a southerly {{direction}} {{to where the}} river took a sharp bend, or were much deeper in the forest than had at first seemed possible to me, for a full hour was spent making {{our way through the}} tangled underbrush, now slowly because of the necessity for silence, and again pressing forward as rapidly as we deemed safe, and not until such a length of time had elapsed did we come to the bank of the stream.|$|R
40|$|The media {{scenario}} in India {{has undergone a}} spectacular change since In-dependence.

60|$|Fortune so far favored {{me as we}} {{run that}} I was speedily armed with an axe which had been left near by a pile of fuel, and before <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> twenty yards further Pierre came upon a pick. Therefore it was {{we had all the}} weapons we needed for an attack upon the guard-house, if so be little Frenchie had the same aim in mind which had come to me, that is to say, to force an {{entrance}} through the chimney into the fireplace.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{ten days}} we {{followed}} this river which runs beside our village. Up toward its source <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> until on the tenth day {{we came to}} a little spring far up upon the side of a lofty mountain range. In this little spring our river is born. The next day we crossed {{over the top of the}} mountain, and upon the other side {{we came to a}} tiny rivulet which we followed down into a great forest. For many days <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> along the winding banks of the rivulet that had now become a river, until we came to a greater river, into which it emptied, and which ran down the center of a mighty valley.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} {{at a little}} distance, and thus <b>we</b> <b>traveled</b> the ten miles back to the ranch. When we reached the corrals she dismounted and, turning her horse over to Dick, she went off toward the house {{without so much as}} a nod or good-by to me.|$|E

5000|$|In 1978, {{after hearing}} of Brel's death, McKuen {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "As friends and as musical {{collaborators}} <b>we</b> had <b>traveled,</b> toured and written - together and apart - the events of our lives {{as if they were}} songs, and I guess they were. When news of Jacques' death came I stayed locked in my bedroom and drank for a week. That kind of self-pity was something he wouldn't have approved of, but all I could do was replay our songs (our children) and ruminate over our unfinished life together." ...|$|R
40|$|If you are old enough, you {{remember}} how excited you were when you learned that Mars might have canals, edible vegetation, and a thin but almost breathable atmosphere. By the 1970 s, however, people knew that these were only wishful thoughts because <b>we</b> had <b>traveled</b> there – not in person – but with various sensors and probes. We imaged the planet at high resolution, analyzed its soil and atmosphere for trace elements, and studied how its geology, geography and climate interacted. Many technological developments in space science were necessary to investigate this large and distant planet. Today, researchers are beginning to harness advance...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> had not <b>traveled</b> {{thus for}} {{a quarter of a mile}} when my quick ear caught the cluck-cluck of turkeys. [...] "Listen," [...] I whispered, halting. Romer became like a statue, his dark eyes dilating, his {{nostrils}} quivering, his whole body strung. He was a Zane all right. A turkey called again; then another answered. Romer started, and nodded his head vehemently.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>traveled</b> {{directly}} toward Sari. Stopping {{at the camp}} where I had been captured I recovered my express rifle, for which I was very thankful. I found it lying where I had left it when I had been overpowered in my sleep by the Sagoths who bad captured me and slain my Mezop companions.|$|E
6000|$|... "But to {{be brief}} in my tale. Again, ere {{we came to}} the level, [...] Slipped from its axle a wheel; so that, to be plain in my statement, [...] A matter of twelve hundred yards or more, as the {{distance}} may be, [...] <b>We</b> <b>traveled</b> upon ONE wheel, until we drove up to the station.|$|E
6000|$|... "After a weary time, {{when the}} sun was gone and the bite of the frost come into the air, the head man pointed {{the nose of the}} {{schooner}} south.

60|$|Many as {{were the}} country players whom <b>we</b> {{seasoned}} and <b>traveled</b> professionals had run across, this twirler outclassed them for remarkable appearance. Moreover, what put an entirely different tinge to our momentary humor was the discovery that he was as wild as a March hare and could throw a ball so fast that it resembled a pea shot from a boy's air gun.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time a sense of {{distrust}} in my own ability found lodgment in my mind. It seemed positive <b>we</b> had either <b>traveled</b> in the wrong direction, or the savages had left the vicinity where the encounter had taken place. Surely we ought to have come across Kenton, unless he made a wider detour than at first seemed probable, or, as I feared, had been taken prisoners.|$|R

She takes round the saucer for the money, and she acts {{with me in the}} tricks that require two persons; it is she who disappears from the basket. We are everything to each other, sahib. But what is my lord's name? Will he tell his servant, that he and Rabda may think of him and talk of him as they tramp the roads together?" ...|$|R
