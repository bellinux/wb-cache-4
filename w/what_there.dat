25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> is to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described {{earlier in}} the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and <b>what</b> <b>there</b> is to tell about it. High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E
500|$|In the past, numismatic {{writers have}} {{described}} the Association and its activities harshly. Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins [...] "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired". Slabaugh noted that [...] "Artistically, {{this is my favorite}} commemorative coin. [...] But from an ethical standpoint, it is not." [...] Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's [...] "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions". [...] According to Bowers, [...] "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins." [...] These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records. [...] Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in The Numismatist concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".|$|E

As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but {{this is one of the}} situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E
