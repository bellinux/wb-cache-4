[...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E
2500|$|NTSB {{chairman}} Christopher Hart said that, as the Board {{had learned}} [...] "with {{a high degree}} of certainty the events that resulted in the breakup", he hoped the investigation would prevent such an accident from happening again. [...] "Many of the safety issues that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> about today arose not from the novelty of a space launch test flight, but from human factors that were already known elsewhere in transportation." [...] Hart added [...] "for commercial spaceflight to successfully mature, we must meticulously seek out and mitigate known hazards, as a prerequisite to identifying and mitigating new hazards." [...] Virgin Galactic is proceeding with its plans for space flight and is building another craft; company officials said that their commitment to commercial spacecraft had not wavered despite the crash and they expected the company to resume test flights later in 2015, though that date subsequently slipped.|$|E
2500|$|While {{being interviewed}} by Haaretz in May 2011, Ehud Shani said that [...] "during the last visit by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Israel a month ago, {{we were told}} that the delay may be shorter than they {{originally}} thought. In any case, I am not nervous about it. This [...] may actually serve our interests. I favor an aircraft with as many Israeli-made systems as possible." [...] He also said that [...] "we will see how they try to meet our requests over this time. In the original timetable, it was argued that there was no time [...] <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> their conclusions and I expect a dialogue with the Americans over the new timetable and the changes." [...] The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s {{in order to meet the}} gap that will be created [...] "is not relevant," [...] he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30. Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.|$|E

PC Mags Matthew Murray called her voice actor [...] "irreplaceable" [...] and called GLaDOS [...] "saucy and strangely sympathetic". The Daily Mails James O'Brien wrote that GLaDOS had [...] "some of the sharpest, funniest lines <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> in any fictional form this year, not just video games". An editor for [...] CBS News wrote that [...] "the {{interactions between the}} player, GLaDOS and Wheatley are what give [...] "Portal 2" [...] its charm and provide much of the humor that keeps the game captivating puzzle after puzzle". The Globe and Mails Chad Sepieha listed the top five insults from GLaDOS in Portal 2, which included [...] "Science has now validated your birth mother’s decision to abandon you on a doorstep." [...] Rock Paper Shotgun's John Walker wrote that [...] "Ellen McLain returns as GLaDOS, and is pushed so much further this time, hitting every single line with perfection". Game Informers Adam Biessener wrote that while Portal 2 was less quotable than its predecessor, [...] "repeating GLaDOS lines stopped being funny a long time ago". He also wrote [...] "I never once thought I'd place GLaDOS second on any list of [...] "Portal" [...] characters, but J.K. Simmons' character surpasses the malevolent AI even though she's as amusing as ever".|$|E

The latter needs now an evolution, mainly for its functional aspects. The proctologist cannot restrict his competence to the posterior perineum, as the urologist and the gynaecologist, when evaluating the pelvic floor and its diseases, {{must take into}} account the posterior compartment. A unitary view of the pelvic organs function then creates a sort of superspecialty that must open new spaces to the research insuring to the patients more rational solutions. Perineology is then a medical branch of which <b>we</b> probably <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> talking more and more in the future." [...] (G. Dodi, RICP 1990; 9: 113 [...] ) ...|$|R
