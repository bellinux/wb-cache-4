At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159km/h (99mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000trees fell {{due to the}} strong winds, more than half in the city, and 7,649homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and <b>water</b> <b>pumps,</b> leaving residents without access to water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000houses and caused ¥1.9billion (CNY, $230million USD). There were at least eight deaths in the province.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days after the hurricane struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death. Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations.

Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm.

Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean.

Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility.
