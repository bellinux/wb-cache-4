Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E
5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive leopard seal was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|E
5|$|At the house, the Doctor is {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} factors {{determine}} whether or not a depleted gas field <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> economically viable storage facility. Geographically, depleted reservoirs should be relatively close to gas markets and to transportation infrastructure (pipelines and distribution systems) which will connect them to that market. Since the fields were at one time productive and connected to infrastructure, distance from market is the dominant geographical factor. Geologically, it is preferred that depleted reservoir formations have high porosity and permeability. The porosity of the formation is one of the factors that determines the amount of natural gas the reservoir is able to hold. Permeability {{is a measure of the}} rate at which natural gas flows through the formation and ultimately determines the rate of injection and withdrawal of gas from storage.|$|E
25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is a form}} of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems). For instance, it has been used to orient liquid crystal domains selectively, and to create nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.-sonogel glasses|journal=Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1007/s10971-010-2265-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f06488h188176783/}} Azo isomerization can also be used to photo-switch the liquid crystal phase of a material from cholesteric to nematic or to change the pitch of a cholesteric phase.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{explanation of}} the ultimatum game as a well-formed experiment approximating general behaviour often leads to a conclusion that the rational behavior in assumption is accurate to a degree, but must encompass additional vectors of decision making. Behavioral economic and psychological accounts suggest that second players who reject offers less than 50% of the amount at stake do so for one of two reasons. An altruistic punishment account suggests that rejections occur out of altruism: people reject unfair offers to teach the first player a lesson and thereby reduce {{the likelihood that the}} player <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> unfair offer in the future. Thus, rejections are made to benefit the second player in the future, or other people in the future. By contrast, a self-control account suggests that rejections constitute a failure to inhibit a desire to punish the first player for making an unfair offer. Morewedge, Krishnamurti, and Ariely (2014) found that intoxicated participants were more likely to reject unfair offers than sober participants. As intoxication tends to exacerbate decision makers' prepotent response, this result provides support for the self-control than the altruistic punishment account. Other research from social cognitive neuroscience supports this finding.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but I <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E

For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot; Sullivan immediately rejected it. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed. [...] Although it was not a grand opera, The Yeomen of the Guard (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date. As early as 1883, Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885, he told an interviewer, [...] ""The opera of the future is a compromise [...] – a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school. ... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life."
