In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music.

The show, entitled Réflexions profondes sur pas mal de trucs (Profound reflections on quite a few things), played on theatrical [...] "flops", a form of humour that Tsamere said [...] "can seem easy [...] is not <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> start to work on it". It was performed at the Blancs Manteaux theatre from April 2005 to January 2006.|$|E

The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and {{you know what that}} means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'" ...|$|E
500|$|New York Magazine {{praised the}} {{abortion}} storyline, {{saying that the}} show [...] "was brave enough to do what almost no other series will: show this one particular, totally legal medical procedure on TV" [...] and that the abortion was [...] "the only plausible resolution" [...] for Yang's pregnancy. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: [...] "It alternately seems silly and not silly, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think about it." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying: [...] "Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past." [...] HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was [...] "interesting" [...] as [...] "it showed us a new side of her—and after so many seasons, that was some welcome insight." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Superunknown {{captured}} the metal influences of the band's previous works while showcasing the group's newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} band's [...] "earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia." [...] Cornell labeled the album as more [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "versatile" [...] than the band's previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example [...] "Half", sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, Thayil explained, [...] "We looked deep down inside {{the very core of}} our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> look deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was [...] "just a matter of refinement." [...] According to The A.V. Club, the album [...] "both redefined and transcended grunge". Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as [...] "some of the rawest music made".|$|E

In several interviews {{at the time}} of the album's release, Gartside stated his dissatisfaction with Rough Trade's promotion of the record, hinting in one interview that [...] "there's still a lot of problems, as far as I'm concerned, fundamental matters of distribution and economics, promotion, marketing and a bias against their product at radio stations" [...] and in another he complained, [...] "I must say I've been badly disappointed the way RT have handled the past three singles.

Several years later, wanting to be closer to her sons, she returned to Los Angeles and obtained a real estate license, like her eldest sister, Kay. In 1995, she landed a small part as the [...] "Madam" [...] in Wild Bill. In 1998, she appeared as herself in the Kevin Burns TV documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes about the making of the first five Planet of the Apes films. In October 1998, Harrison attended her first science fiction convention in New Jersey. Also in attendance were Jonathan Harris, Marta Kristen, Mark Goddard and Angela Cartwright, of the original Lost in Space TV series; Lou Ferrigno of The Incredible Hulk TV series; and Bela Lugosi Jr. and Sara Karloff. Harrison found it [...] "rewarding <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> haven't done anything {{for a number of years}} and then, all of a sudden, people want your autograph. It was very gratifying." [...] Eventually, Harrison became an institution at Planet of the Apes cons. [...] "I like it. It's very good. You're being appreciated for your work." [...] In 2001, she had a cameo as the [...] "Woman in Cart" [...] in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes. [...] "They are much more brutal in the new movie," [...] she said. [...] "And strong.

Some may use the extra free time to improve their quality of life, for example pursuing creative activities such as art and crafts. Developing a detachment from money has led some individuals, such as Suelo and Mark Boyle, to live with no money at all.
