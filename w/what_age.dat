25|$|Since Andrea was {{a member}} of the Servite {{religious}} order, whose records have largely survived intact, more is known about his life than is usually the case for fourteenth-century composers. He entered the order in 1375, though at <b>what</b> <b>age</b> is not known. One of his first activities within the order was to carry out a commission to build an organ for the Servite house in Florence, for which he hired Francesco Landini as a consultant. Among the surviving records are the receipts for the wine that the two consumed during the three days it took to tune the instrument.|$|E
500|$|Both Rachel and Janet are Detective Constables in the Major Incident Team of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Service, {{with the}} team headed by DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), who is loosely based on Diane Taylor. Producers were {{undecided}} on <b>what</b> <b>age</b> DCI Murray would be, but had originally pictured an actress older than Bullmore. After auditioning, Bullmore returned a month later, intent on playing Murray [...] "tough", however, when meeting casting director Beverley Keogh in the toilets beforehand, Bullmore recounted that Keogh said to her: [...] "That's not what we've got you back for. We were interested in seeing a warmer side".|$|E
500|$|The films {{also contain}} {{elements}} of visual humour: when Jaws is {{dropped into a}} shark pool in The Spy Who Loved Me, it is Jaws who bites the shark. The following film, Moonraker, sees Bond in a comic chase scene with a gondola that becomes a hovercraft, a continuation that Bond author Raymond Benson considered [...] "so dumb that one wonders at <b>what</b> <b>age</b> group the film was really aimed." [...] The music and sound effects are also used for comic effect in the films: the laboratory of Hugo Drax is opened by touchtones that play the tune of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whilst when Bond and Anya are seen walking across the desert in The Spy Who Loved Me, the theme from Lawrence of Arabia is heard.|$|E

500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period— no matter <b>what</b> <b>age</b> you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone, Premiere, USA Today, and The Boston Globe all {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four, while Baltimore Sun gave the film a B grade. They cited that {{although}} the story is relatively predictable, {{the way in which}} the predictability of the film is part of the story, the amazingly extravagant musical numbers, along with the way in which Disney pokes fun at its traditional line of animated movies outweighs any squabbles about storyline or being unsure of <b>what</b> <b>age</b> bracket the film is made for. Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun remarked that the film's [...] "piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie-making and uncertain tone", while Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that [...] "though it's a fairly predictable fish-out-of-water tale (actually a princess-out-of-storybook saga), the casting is so perfect that it takes what could have been a ho-hum idea and renders it magical." ...|$|E
500|$|In England, Wenger {{has used}} his {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration. The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market. He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and Emmanuel Eboué, and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Hector Bellerín, amongst other La Masia graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him. Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who disputed it was tantamount to child trafficking. Wenger refuted the analogy and said: [...] "Look at Santa Cruz at Blackburn. Ask him <b>what</b> <b>age</b> he came to Bayern Munich. Then you {{have an answer for}} Rummenigge." ...|$|E

40|$|April 28 th 2010 the Swedish {{parliament}} {{decided that}} the combined teacher exam will be divided into four parts. This means that the education for preschool teachers and primary school teachers {{will have to be}} separated and future teachers will have to decide before their studies <b>what</b> <b>ages</b> they want to work with. To investigate if this could affect the quality of the choice I have interviewed 5 new teachers from the combined teachers program about <b>what</b> <b>ages</b> they wanted to teach before they began to study and <b>what</b> <b>ages</b> they wanted to teach after completed studies. I did this to see whether the choice was influenced by the educations or not. It turned out that all 5 had an idea of <b>what</b> <b>ages</b> they wanted to teach in before they began the educations and only one of my interviewees changed her mind during the studies. The others felt that their choice was confirmed during the educations. It was mainly during the practical training that they received an idea {{of what it was like}} to work as a teacher. Four of them received a positive image of what it was like to work in preschool, while several of them said they got negative experiences from primary school. This could be one of the reasons why four of the five interviewees work in preschool today. The person who changed her mind changed from wanting to work in primary to wanting to work in preschool after the practical training. The interviewees chose the profession that they perceived filled their need of affection, appreciation and acknowledgement. They also thought that the profession they opted out seemed more difficult than the profession they have today. They identified themselves no more or less with any career before they began the studies and feel today that they can only identify with the profession they want, which in all except one case, is the profession they’ve got. The idea of what teachers are like changed during the studies and became more positive and reality based. All interviewees got more knowledge about teachers and their work during the studies and had a better understanding to base their decision on after completed studies...|$|R
500|$|My Gym Partner's a Monkey {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. William Barker of Web Wombat gave the King of the Jungle DVD a positive review, awarding {{it with a}} score of 70%, saying: [...] "With an original – dare I say unique? – premise, My Gym Partner's a Monkey makes for a somewhat refreshing change from super heroes and mutants, and the cut-out animation style is captivating, though far from novel. It's not the most impressive cartoon show I've ever seen, but it's quite cute and fairly amusing – even for the older primates among us." [...] Larisa Wiseman of Common Sense Media awarded the series three out of five stars, saying: [...] "It's difficult to tell <b>what</b> <b>age</b> group the show's producers were aiming at – the animation style and slapstick by themselves would seem to appeal mainly to grade-schoolers, while the jokes and life lessons are definitely aimed at the tween set. The sly humor may even give some adults the occasional laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, My Gym Partner's a Monkey is commendable for its effort to include a subtle message in each episode. Younger viewers will probably find Jake's sometimes-annoying goofiness amusing, and will definitely find the story lines entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Elissa Wall {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah, on July 7, 1986 to Douglas and Sharon (Steed) Wall, both members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS). The FLDS is a Mormon {{denomination}} that split from the mainstream The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) following the latter's decision to outlaw polygamy in 1890. Wall's family practiced polygamy, and Sharon was the second of three wives. As is typical among the FLDS, Wall's parents produced {{a large number of}} children, with Lloyd having 24 children in total and 14 by Sharon. Female members of the FLDS wore [...] "long pioneer style dresses" [...] and styled their hair in traditional buns and braids. The mandated undergarments covered their full form, [...] "from the wrist to the ankle and right up to the neck", while makeup, tattoos, and piercings were not permitted. Wall, along with other FLDS children, grew up attending the Alta Academy, which was owned and run by the church. Warren Jeffs, a leader in the community, read from the Book of Mormon at eight in the morning. [...] "No matter <b>what</b> <b>age</b> you were, you were expected to attend and take notes," [...] said Wall. [...] "It was a very religious education...As a child in that society, you hung on every word. I remember believing in it so much it would almost consume me." [...] She later referred to her education as [...] "brainwashing".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the uses}} for scales that assess sexual {{orientation}} is determining what {{the prevalence of}} different sexual orientations are within a population. Depending on subject's age, culture and sex, the prevalence rates of homosexuality vary depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or sexual identity. Assessing sexual attraction will yield the greatest prevalence of homosexuality in a population whereby the proportion of individuals indicating they are same sex attracted is {{two to three times}} greater than the proportion reporting same sex behavior or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Furthermore, reports of same sex behavior usually exceed those of gay, lesbian, or bisexual identification.

2500|$|Old age {{comprises}} [...] "the later part of life; {{the period}} of life after youth and middle age [...] [...] [...], usually with reference to deterioration". At <b>what</b> <b>age</b> old age begins cannot be universally defined because it differs according to the context. Most developed-world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of 'elderly' or older person. The United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age {{and this is the}} first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) set 50 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society.|$|E
2500|$|Although studies {{justify the}} notion that people often do not {{contribute}} to online communities, some research shows that older adults are actually more likely to participate in online communities than younger people because different generations tend {{to use the internet}} differently. For example, [...] "older adults are more likely to seek health information, make purchases, and obtain religious information, but less likely to watch videos, download music, play games, and read blogs online". This is perhaps {{due in part to the}} fact that some online communities cater to older generations. The content of the website often determines <b>what</b> <b>age</b> group will use or visit the site, and because many forms of online communities appear on sites that focus their attention on older adults, participation is generally higher. Additionally, the ease and availability of operating the websites that host the online community may play a role in the age group that is most likely to participate. For example, some online communities geared toward older adults have simplified the design of their sites in order to enhance their look and usability for older adults.|$|E
