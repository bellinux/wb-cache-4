The concepts of war are described {{in the terms of}} Nazi wartime propaganda, such as 'drama', 'tragedy' and 'fate' (direct quotes from Gray Wolves). This not only has a war-trivialising effect, but also shows war as a desirable state". The [...] "divine principle of war as a duty" [...] and a [...] "natural event" [...] is a hallmark of such works, <b>Wilking</b> concludes.

However, a witness told a different story - Clark had refused <b>Wilks</b> entry on the grounds {{he was a man of}} bad character, and that <b>Wilks</b> had then claimed to be owed money by Clark for some vegetables he had sold him, and refused to go away until he was paid. Clark tried to remove <b>Wilks</b> from the Hotel, and <b>Wilks</b> struck out at Clark, who then retaliated.

However, the first officer of <b>Wilk</b> said that the enemy submarine was rammed in front of its deck gun, which suggests that <b>Wilk</b> indeed sank a U-boat, as O-13 lacked such a weapon.|$|R
