When we read James Bond we know whose side <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on,</b> why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> that side {{and why we}} are certain to win. In the real world {{that is no longer}} possible." [...] Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission [...] "is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent." [...] The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was [...] "Bond's latest and grimmest mission", which she called [...] "Escapism in the Grand Manner".|$|E

500|$|... "Whatever It Takes" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{alternative}} band Lifehouse. It is {{the second}} single released from their fourth studio album, Who We Are (2007). The song was written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record producer Jude Cole. When discussing the song, Wade felt that {{the message of the}} song dealt with how difficult it could be to be in a relationship. It was first released with the band's fourth studio album Who <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>on</b> June 18, 2007 and was then solicited to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007. It is a moderately slow pop-rock ballad that has influences of adult alternative.|$|E
500|$|... "Liberian Girl"'s lyrics {{were viewed}} as [...] "glistening" [...] with [...] "gratitude" [...] for the [...] "existence of a loved one". [...] "Smooth Criminal"'s {{recalled}} [...] "the popcorn-chomping manner" [...] of [...] "Thriller". The track was thought of {{as an example of}} [...] "Jackson's free-form language" [...] that keeps people [...] "aware that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates". The music in [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", a duet with Siedah Garrett, consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani. [...] "Just Good Friends", a duet with Stevie Wonder, was viewed by critics as sounding good {{at the beginning of the}} song, ending with a [...] "chin-bobbing cheerfulness". [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"'s music consisted of blues harmonies. The lyrics of [...] "Another Part of Me" [...] deal with being united, as [...] "we".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who <b>We</b> <b>Are,</b> <b>on</b> June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the plan {{is that it is}} not victim-centric and that its support for victims is insufficient. Bethany Hastie of McGill University said that the HTNCC had a good track record of intelligence assessment and awareness-raising with respect to human trafficking, and she therefore approved of the plan's funding of the HTNCC. She was critical of the plan's emphasis on law enforcement, saying that [...] "the crime-fighting focus of the plan has unfortunately detracted from...victim services." [...] She said that more attention to victim services was necessary because most Canadian provinces were employing only ad-hoc methods of supporting victims, often omitting important elements such as legal aid and situation-appropriate shelter. A few weeks after the establishment of the NAP-CHT, Dean Allison, MP for Niagara West—Glanbrook, Ontario travelled to Cambodia and Thailand to learn more about human trafficking as part of a parliamentary delegation with World Vision Canada, and he said that his meetings there convinced him [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the right track in Canada with our National Action Plan." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'...

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E
