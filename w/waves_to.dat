5|$|The powerfully {{rising and}} sinking air in {{mountain}} waves {{was discovered by}} glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|During July 1915, Brownell {{was shipped}} to Gallipoli and rejoined the 9th Battery. Promoted to bombardier on 12 November, {{he was among}} one of the final Australian <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> be {{evacuated}} from the peninsula in December during the Allied withdrawal. Returning to Egypt, he was advanced to provisional sergeant on 24 February 1916. Embarking with his unit from Alexandria, Brownell arrived in France for service on the Western Front on 29 March, following a six-day voyage.|$|E
5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, the typhoon brought high <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> Guam, {{resulting in}} one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, {{which resulted in}} 13deaths. Government offices, schools and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. A total of 300poer poles were brought down; consequently, {{nearly a quarter of}} Taiwan residents lost power {{at the height of the}} storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{activity}} was above average {{during this time}} period. A hurricane in 1903 hit near Atlantic City, causing heavy damage near the shore. The most severe hurricane in the time period was the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane. Though it did not make landfall, it brought strong winds and <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> the coastline, destroying hundreds of homes.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{rescued by}} the USS Urania, a Coast Guard vessel {{which is part}} of a group heading to Devil's Reef on February 10, {{following}} up on a lead provided by the FBI. On the way there, wizards on the reef summon powerful tidal <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> destroy the flotilla but Jack kills them. The humanoid fish-men known as Deep Ones launch a mass attack on the Urania and eventually Dagon emerges too. Jack manages to defeat the gigantic demigod, but Urania sinks.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the {{untested}} 29th Infantry Division, {{along with}} nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc, were to assault the western {{half of the}} beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> land.|$|E

5|$|On {{days when}} a large bore is expected, {{hundreds}} of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, waiting for the <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for {{this part of the}} river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the bore.|$|E
5|$|Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from radio <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|E
5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was {{a series}} of tests during and after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging shock <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E

5|$|The player {{encounters}} {{more than}} fifteen types of enemy, not including level bosses. Some are easy to destroy; others, including the fire creatures found on the Iridion home world, are indestructible and must be avoided. Other enemies prevent the player from dodging enemy fire by laying mines to block paths. Passive objects, such as garbage or asteroids, can damage or destroy the player's craft. Enemies vary in armor and weaponrysome cannot return fire but travel in <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> ram the player.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{first brought}} heavy {{rainfall}} to Jamaica, causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides. While crossing Cuba {{and later the}} Bahamas, the storm caused little impact, limited to some crop damage. As a subtropical storm, Gilda brought gusty winds and high <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> much of {{the east coast of}} the United States, causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Abe killed 108–195people {{after it}} caused {{flooding}} and landslides in the Philippines and Taiwan, ravaged coastal areas of China, and brought high <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> Japan. Abe, {{which is responsible}} for killing 108 in China, affected half of Zhejiang's land area and a fourth of its population, leaving thousands homeless and causing ¥3.5billion yuan (RMB, $741.5–743million USD) to be lost in damages. Additional damage and one fatality occurred in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, where at least ¥890million yen (JPY, $6million USD) in damage was caused.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Web-based {{communication}} and collaboration {{is a significant}} trend in modern enterprises. However, communication as well as collaboration still makes use of various platforms like email, instant-messaging, or wikis. Google introduced Google <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> solve the disadvantages in usage caused by the combination of multiple technologies. The contribution {{of this paper is}} an analysis comparing <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> other kinds of {{communication and}} collaboration with regard to its application as an enterprise 2. 0 tool. Based on this, an integration prototype is implemented, which reveals the essential effort of interconnecting Google <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> an Enterprise Content Management System. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab. The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> replenish a countdown timer, which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead Nightmare owners can initiate them.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the <b>WAVES</b> <b>to</b> become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
5|$|Bavi and its {{precursor}} {{tropical disturbance}} impacted eastern Micronesia, with strong to gale force winds of between , reported on various atolls in the Marshall Islands. Considerable damage was {{reported on the}} islet of Ebeye, on the main atoll of Kwajalein, {{a small amount of}} tree damage was reported, while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use. Overall damages in the Marshall Islands were estimated at US$2.1 million, while a fishing vessel and its crew of nine were reported missing during March 12. After impacting Eastern Micronesia, Bavi approached the Mariana Islands, with its circulation passing over Guam during March 15, where it caused the highest <b>waves</b> <b>to</b> be recorded on the island in a decade. Bavi also impacted the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan, where power outages were reported and five houses were destroyed. Total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150 thousand.|$|E
