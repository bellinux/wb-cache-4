The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was not passed until November 8, 1960 – and only by a slim margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.|$|E

The practical part focuses on a system of tendering process in a construction company. The thesis gives a detailed description of a public tender mechanism for subcontractors in relation to a specific <b>works</b> <b>contract.</b> The thesis also focuses on the tasks that are given to employees working on the <b>works</b> <b>contract.</b> The main goal of the thesis is to find effective approaches in order to improve the whole process of tendering...|$|R

40|$|Non-renewable {{fixed-term}} {{and agency}} <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are becoming more}} used instead of the traditional Russian model of open-ended employment. The authors examine the influence of institutional and organizational factors {{on the use of}} two forms of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> in Russia with data from a Survey covering 3313 enterprises for the years 2009 to 2011. Probit and Tobit regressions are used to test several hypotheses about the use of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> derived from the literature. The results indicate that state-owned and unionized enterprises are more likely to use fixed-term contracts; and a high level of perceived dismissal protection for permanent workers is positively associated with fixed-term contracts use. The incidence and intensity of fixed-term and agency <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> are lower at enterprises with flexible wages. A significant impact of organizational factors is confirmed only for fixed-term contracts. Enterprises use less fixed-term contracts, if they have workers with tenure from 5 to 10 years and high job complexity...|$|R

25|$|Near {{the end of}} 1928, miners' {{leaders in}} the Jiu Valley had begun {{agitating}} for an extension of their collective <b>work</b> <b>contract.</b> Their demands included (in conformity with new legislation adopted under international pressure) an eight-hour workday, a 40% raise for those who worked at furnaces and in pits, the provision of food and boots, {{and an end to}} children working underground. The two sides could not reach an agreement. A trial ensued, and as the ruling of a court in Deva was not to the miners' liking, they appealed to the High Court of Cassation and Justice.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 2006 he {{announced}} a similar kind of <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> (called Contrat première embauche, or CPE) {{for young people}} (under 26). The parliament approved on 8 February. Subsequently students started to protest. This wave of protest eventually forced the government to give in. Although the law on the CPE is formally still valid, the government promised to hinder its application and initiated a new legal initiative which will abolish the key points of the CPE. During the protests, Villepin was widely perceived as stubborn and arrogant. As a consequence, his popularity rates went down rapidly and {{he was no longer}} regarded as a serious contender for the 2007 presidential election.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} cost of the trans-atlantic voyage at this time, many English {{settlers}} came to Jamestown as indentured servants: in exchange for the passage, room, board, and the promise of land or money, these immigrants would agree to work for three to seven years. Immigrants from continental Europe, mainly Germans, were usually redemptioners—they purchased some portion of their voyage on credit and, upon arrival, borrowed or entered into a <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> to pay the remainder of their voyage costs. Along with European indentured servants, around 20 African slaves arrived in Jamestown in 1619. These slaves were captives taken from a ship headed for Mexico. Though these Africans started in Jamestown as slaves, some were able to obtain the status of indentured servant later in life.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012 Beate Lakotta, {{journalist}} for the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel {{covered the}} lawsuit {{and stated that}} there were plausible explanations {{for most of the}} claims laid out by Mollath and his defenders. Contrary to the argument by German daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the medical certificate had not been the result of a conspiracy between a friend of Mollath's former wife, who worked as a receptionist in the issuing doctor's office but had been issued by the son of the owner, himself a medical practitioner. It had only been issued after the charges had already been pressed, but was based on entries in Mollath's medical record from 2011. Lakotta stated that proof for the claim that Mollath's former wife was involved in money laundering and a tax evasion scheme did not exist, as having assets abroad was not a crime. A labor court had overturned the extraordinary termination of her <b>work</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E

This legislation also allowed parents (under the same conditions) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave. In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity. For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures {{must be taken to}} accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years' service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the <b>work</b> <b>contract.</b> The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.|$|E

25|$|By early February, {{a massive}} illegal {{financing}} network had been uncovered affecting the PPCV, {{with dozens of}} party officials and city councillors indicted or arrested. Judicial investigation also pointed to former long-time Mayor of Valencia and PP icon, Rita Barberá, as {{a participant in the}} scandal. The party found itself at risk of losing its municipal group in the city of Valencia—the third largest of Spain, which had seen 24 years of PP rule under Barberá's command—and rumours arising on a refoundation of the party in the region. The PP had been expelled from the local and regional Valencian governments in the elections held throughout 2015 after a two decade-uninterrupted rule. As corruption scandals also spread to Madrid on 11 February, with evidence suggesting that the public <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> kickbacks of 'Operation Punica' could also involve a possible illegal financing of the PP in the region, Esperanza Aguirre, regional party president of Madrid, resigned from her position on 14 February, in a move that was widely interpreted as a broadside against Rajoy, her long-standing party rival.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the study}} committee's report, {{the school board}} agreed to use a {{one-time}} refund on insurance premiums to pay for $575,000 in repairs at Memorial Stadium. These included east bleacher drainage improvements, east bleacher foundation and stairway improvements, and adding handicapped-accessible areas to both {{the east and west}} grandstands. The cost of these upgrades increased to $600,000 in May 2000. Costs had actually decreased because an engineer's assessment came in lower than expected and an accounting error was discovered that removed double-counting of expenses. With the additional expenditure of just $25,000, however, the work could now be expanded to include entirely replacing the east bleachers, replacing the running track, and doubling the size of the team meeting/concessions buildings. In May 2000, the work was expected to be complete by the fall. The school board had yet to decide whether the track should be expanded to 10 lanes, but did agree to solicit bids to determine the cost of improving the west grandstand. The track was expanded to eight lanes two weeks later. The track <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> came in 16 percent low, which enabled the school district to add improvements to the long-jump paths and pits as well. The contract for replacing the east bleachers, however, came in $95,000 high after contractors discovered that the existing drainage system was far more damaged than previously suspected. In June 2000, the school board agreed to tap its general maintenance fund to pay for the work on the west bleachers after these cost estimates came in much lower than expected.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to improve}} upon the highly unconcretised <b>works</b> <b>contract</b> {{performance}} research, {{by examining the}} relationships between contract management, inter-functional coordination, trust and <b>works</b> <b>contract</b> performance and whether these variables {{have an effect on}} the contract performance. Design/methodology/approach – This study is cross-sectional and correlational. It also takes the descriptive and analytical design. Data were collected from a representative sample of 108 completed and fully documented <b>works</b> <b>contracts</b> in the central government procuring and disposing entities in Uganda, in the financial year 2013 / 2014. Out of these, responses from 64 were used for analysis, using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). Findings – The results suggest that delivery management is relatively more important than relation management and contract management and that in a rules based system, the importance of inter-functional coordination to contract performance is minimal, further expounding on the critical difference between private and public procurement systems. Originality/value – This study, unlike other studies in developing countries, considers individual issues of contract performance rather than holistic performance of a procuring and disposing entity. <b>Works</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|R

In this case, Ms Barratt was told her employment was terminated in a letter that she opened 3 days after its arrival. When, 3 months and 2 days after arrival, she lodged an unfair dismissal claim, the employer argued it was time barred {{on the ground that}} in ordinary contract law one is bound by a notice when a reasonable person would have read a message. The Supreme Court held that Ms Barratt was in time for a claim because she was only bound by the notice when she actually read it.
