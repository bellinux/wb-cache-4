5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E

5|$|Rei finds {{a heavily}} injured man and races {{to try to}} save his life, but the man shortly dies after he brings him to the church. The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei {{repeatedly}} tries to go see Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople. Rei is nearly killed by them, but Shiona protects him from a gunshot, which leaves her unconscious, but alive. Rei takes Shiona back to the library where they regroup with Tipi before leaving through the sewer system to make it back to the church. A lone man comes to the church, and while Rei is fighting him, the man uses a grenade, but Shiona protects Rei from the blast.|$|E

25|$|Some {{families}} build altars {{or small}} shrines in their homes; these sometimes feature a Christian cross, statues or {{pictures of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary, pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an ofrenda. Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.|$|E
25|$|The last {{communication}} with the rover was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010) {{and there is a}} strong possibility the rover’s batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above −40°C, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to −55°C. If Spirit had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that would <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rover.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before radio, {{dispatching}} locomotives involved using whatever means of communication were available. The BR maintained a helper station at a siding between Dellwood and Lanes Mills, south of Brockwayville. The 700 series Mallets stationed here were required to assist coal trains up to McMinn Summit. When this was necessary, the dispatcher would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to the siding. A loud bell generally sufficed to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> engine crew. On those occasions when it did not, the dispatcher would call the McMinn farm nearby, {{and one of the}} McMinn children would run over to the siding to awaken the engineer and fireman.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} {{featured}} Ric Flair defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat. Steamboat got the early momentum until Flair began attacking Steamboat.

Flair delivered an Inverted Atomic Drop to Steamboat and followed a Figure Four Leglock. Flair began attacking Steamboat's knee. Steamboat eventually gained momentum by performing a Clothesline. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Crossbody on Flair but the referee was hit as well. Steamboat tried to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> referee.

She summed up the episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever, and [...] "is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else".|$|E

[...] He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." [...] Schindler is touched, but also deeply ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. As the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning, a Soviet soldier arrives to announce that they have been liberated.

500|$|The {{first leg}} {{was held at}} Highbury on 1 February 1995. Milan's {{preparations}} were overshadowed by the violence that occurred in their last domestic fixture, against Genoa three days ago. Clashes between both sets of supporters resulted in police intervention {{and the use of}} tear gas. Vincenzo Spagnolo, a Genoa supporter, was stabbed prior to kick-off and subsequently died while receiving treatment. The match was later abandoned once word was sent to the players and staff during half-time. Milan manager Fabio Capello admitted his players were deeply affected by the incident and struggled to focus on the Super Cup match. He told reporters: [...] "I believe that the psychological balance of each player has been damaged by Sunday's tragedy. Our team was in great condition until Sunday. But {{in the past few days}} I have had to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> players. So I'm not able to anticipate which kind of Milan you will see." [...] 800 Milan supporters travelled to London, and Capello denied reports a section of them intended to cause trouble.|$|E

500|$|Ned reluctantly {{agrees with}} this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life. This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns' Casino, but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct, Homer instead takes Ned on a {{gambling}} trip to Las Vegas. Homer is confident about going there, but Flanders is nervous. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from [...] "Bart the Daredevil") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). They wander into a casino called [...] "Nero's Palace" [...] and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They win, but immediately lose all they won. They {{then go to the}} casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on wine spritzers. Homer and Ned <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger. Homer finally realizes he got in over his head. While Homer fantasizes about bigamy, Ned snaps Homer back to reality by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quickie, plastic weddings; also they are already married.|$|E
500|$|... "Brawl in the Family" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{and was the first}} episode Joel H. Cohen received a sole writing credit for. Cohen had previously received a credit for [...] "Hex and the City", the first segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII" [...] which aired the previous year. [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] originally aired on January 6, 2002 on the Fox network. It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner. It was the second of his episodes to air however, since the Christmas-themed [...] "She of Little Faith", the second episode he produced, was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to make a follow-up to the season 10 episode [...] "Viva Ned Flanders". In it, Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun. While there, the two get intoxicated and <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning to find that they have gotten married to two cocktail waitresses, Amber and Ginger. The episode ends with Homer and Ned walking home from Vegas. Jean felt that the ending to [...] "Viva Ned Flanders" [...] was [...] "a bit loose" [...] because [...] "...if you leave a wife in Vegas, they track you down." [...] He pitched [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] in order to [...] "resolve it [...]" [...] Amber and Ginger were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.|$|E
