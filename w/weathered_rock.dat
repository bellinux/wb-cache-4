25|$|The {{surveying}} in 1958–59 catered for immersed {{tube and}} bridge designs {{as well as}} a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964–65 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70boreholes, an area of deeply <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> with high permeability was located just south of Dover harbour.|$|E
25|$|The last {{formation}} in the later, the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation, is composed of porphyritic lava, and is characterized by an absence of angular crystals and pumice derivatives. In places its rhyolite composition intrudes older stratas. This layer is unique for it bridges the exocaldera and intracaldera sequences. A layer of saprolite (chemically <b>weathered</b> <b>rock)</b> separates the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation from the overlying Caldera-Fill Sequence-era rocks. The exposed part of the flow overlies part of the Carrow formation, and is colored pink in the diagram above-right.|$|E

500|$|Lihou is {{the furthest}} {{west of the}} Channel Islands and at low tide it {{is linked to the}} nearby L'Erée headland, on Guernsey, by a [...] stone causeway. Apart from shingle beaches, the island has a [...] high ridge running {{approximately}} north-south. Lihou is mainly composed of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> below which are found granite and gneiss bedrock. The island has a mild oceanic climate like other Channel Islands, due to being buffered by the nearby English and French coastlines. Lihou shares the weather features of Guernsey, with winter temperatures falling to [...] in February and summers with a high of [...] in August.|$|E
500|$|When the {{cofferdams}} were {{in place}} and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, {{it was necessary to}} remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately [...] of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> might provide pathways for water seepage.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogeologically, {{the well}} {{is in the}} Wadi Ibrahim (Valley of Abraham). The upper half of the well is in the sandy {{alluvium}} of the valley, lined with stone masonry except for the top metre (3ft) which has a concrete [...] "collar". The lower half is in the bedrock. Between the alluvium and the bedrock is a [...] section of permeable <b>weathered</b> <b>rock,</b> lined with stone, {{and it is this}} section that provides the main water entry into the well. Water in the well comes from absorbed rainfall in the Wadi Ibrahim, as well as run-off from the local hills. Since the area has become more and more settled, water from absorbed rainfall on the Wadi Ibrahim has decreased.|$|E

40|$|The {{characterization}} of <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks</b> {{by the use}} of drilling parameters is presented. Drilling parameters obtained from the drilling process monitoring system during the installation of soil nails into <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks</b> are used in this investigation. A new drilling index Pi, simplified from the concept of the specific energy, is used in an attempt to differentiate <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks.</b> With Pi, or the penetration rate, boundaries of <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks</b> between (1) soil and rock ranges, and (2) grade II and grade III rocks in accordance with the six-fold rock material decomposition grade are identified. For <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks</b> in the soil range, quantitative characterization has been established in this study by using the drilling parameters. An empirical equation has been established for estimating the standard penetration resistance N value from the drilling parameter Pi, which is used in turn to determine the Mohr-Coulomb friction angle {{based on the work of}} Schmertmann. Although this approach tends to yield a slightly larger Mohr-Coulomb friction angle than that from laboratory tests, results obtained in this attempt reveal that estimation of the Mohr-Coulomb friction angle from drilling parameters is attainable with reasonable accuracy. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

2500|$|Landslides {{in which}} the sliding surface is mostly deeply located below the maximum rooting depth of trees (typically to depths greater than ten meters). Deep-seated {{landslides}} usually involve deep regolith, <b>weathered</b> <b>rock,</b> and/or bedrock and include large slope failure associated with translational, rotational, or complex movement. This type of landslide potentially occurs in an tectonic active region like Zagros Mountain in Iran. [...] These typically move slowly, only several meters per year, but occasionally move faster. They tend to be larger than shallow landslides and form along a plane of weakness such as a fault or bedding plane. They can be visually identified by concave scarps {{at the top and}} steep areas at the toe.|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 1960, Verzasca SA {{was formed}} to {{construct}} the dam as the center-piece of the Verzasca Hydroelectric Complex. Construction in the dam began in 1961. The dam was designed and its construction supervised by Lombardi & Gellaro Ltd. Because the Contra Dam is at a lower elevation compared to other Swiss dams, warmer weather allowed construction {{to be carried out}} year-round. To divert the river and prepare a dry work-site for the dam, cofferdams were constructed, one of which redirected the river through a diversion tunnel with a [...] capacity. As the river can have flows much higher than the tunnel's capacity, this was accepted as a risk by engineers. Excavation of {{the right side of the}} dam had to be expanded due to unforeseen <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> and designs were altered within 15 days.|$|E
60|$|The {{narrow neck}} of the pass opened and descended into a valley half a mile wide, perhaps twice that in length. It had {{apparently}} unscalable slopes of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> leading up to beetling walls. With floor bare and hard and white, except for a patch of green mesquite near the far end it was a lurid and desolate spot, the barren bottom of a desert bowl.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes Wildfire {{was plain}} in his sight for a moment, but usually he was hidden by rocks. The slope was one great talus, {{a jumble of}} <b>weathered</b> <b>rock,</b> fallen from what {{appeared}} a mountain of red and yellow wall. Here {{the heat of the}} sun fell upon him like fire. The rocks were so hot Slone could not touch them with bare hand. The close of the afternoon was approaching, and this slope was interminably long. Still, it was not steep, and the trail was good.|$|E
60|$|More {{rattling}} shots disturbed the noonday quiet. She heard {{a sliding}} of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock,</b> a hoarse shout of warning, a yell of alarm, again the clear, sharp {{crack of the}} rifle, and another cry that was a cry of death. Then rifle reports pierced a dull volley of revolver shots. Bullets whizzed over Jane's hiding-place; one struck a stone and whined away in the air. After that, for a time, succeeded desultory shots; and then they ceased under long, thundering fire from heavier guns.|$|E
60|$|Then {{his actions}} became swift--and Yaqui seldom moved swiftly. The fact {{impressed}} Gale. The Indian searched the level floor under the shelf. He gathered up handfuls of small black stones, and thrust them at Gale. Their weight made Gale start, {{and then he}} trembled. The Indian's next move was {{to pick up a}} piece of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> and throw it against the wall. It broke. He snatched up parts, and showed the broken edges to Gale. They contained yellow steaks, dull glints, faint tracings of green. It was gold.|$|E

60|$|Then he fell. Cameron {{dragged him}} out of the sand pit to a {{sheltered}} place under the ledge. While sitting beside the failing man Cameron discovered painted images on the wall. Often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people. Then, from long habit, he picked up a piece of rock and examined it. Its weight made him closely scrutinize it. The color was a peculiar black. He scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold. Around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black, <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> and pieces of broken ledge, and they showed gold.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} black, with sky mostly {{obscured}} by clouds. A pale haze marked the west where the after glow had faded; {{in the south}} one radiant star crowned a mountain peak. I strolled away in the darkness and sat down upon a stone. How intense the silence! Dead, vast, sepulchre-like, dreaming, waiting, a silence of ages, burdened {{with the history of}} the past, awful! I strained my ears for sound of insect or rustle of sage or drop of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock.</b> The soft cool desert wind was soundless. This silence had something terrifying in it, making me a man alone on the earth. The great spaces, the wild places as they had been millions of years before! I seemed to divine how through them man might develop from savage to a god, and how alas! he might go back again.|$|E
60|$|And {{there in}} the starlight, under the wide-gnarled pines, sighing low with the wind, Helen sat with Dale on the old stone that an {{avalanche}} of a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as camp-table and bench for lovers in the wilderness; the sweet scent of spruce mingled with the fragrance of wood-smoke blown in their faces. How white the stars, and calm and true! How they blazed their single task! A coyote yelped off on the south slope, dark now as midnight. A bit of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf. And the wind moaned. Helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this lonely fastness, and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness that all would some day be well with the troubled world beyond.|$|E

60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{the two friends}} were returning from a long ramble across the open moor, when, near a little knoll of bare and <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> that rose from a circling belt of Cornish heath, they saw Cleer by herself, propped against the huge boulders, with her eyes fixed intently on a paper-covered novel. She looked up and smiled as they approached; and the young men, turning aside from their ill-marked path, came over and stood by her. They talked for awhile about the ordinary nothings of society small-talk, till by degrees Cleer chanced accidentally to bring the conversation round to something {{that had happened to}} her mother and herself a year or two since in Malta. Le Neve snatched at the word; for he was eager to learn all he could about the Trevennacks' movements, so deeply had Cleer already impressed her image on his susceptible nature.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} a goodly distance, {{and he tried to}} imagine, if it {{appeared}} so huge from where he stood, what it would be when he got there. He climbed the terrace and then faced a long, gradual ascent of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> and dust, which made climbing too difficult for attention to anything else. At length he entered a zone of shade, and looked up. He stood just within the hollow of a cavern so immense that he had no conception of its real dimensions. The curved roof, stained by ages of leakage, with buff and black and rust-colored streaks, swept up and loomed higher and seemed to soar to the rim of the cliff. Here again was a magnificent arch, such as formed the grand gateway to the valley, only in this instance it formed the dome of a cave instead of the span of a bridge.|$|E
6000|$|Two other {{important}} sets of catacombs, which I {{will call the}} [...] "buttressed caves," [...] are pierced in the right flank of the same gorge, {{at the base of}} a little conical hill, quaintly capped with a finial of <b>weathered</b> <b>rock.</b> The material is the normal silicious gravel-grit, traversed and cloisonné by dykes of harder stone. Beginning at the south, we find a range of three, facing eastward and separated from one another by flying buttresses of natural rock. No. 1 has a window as well as a door. Next to it is a square with six open loculi ranged from north to south. No. 3 shows a peculiarity--two small pilasters of the rudest (Egyptian?) Doric, the only sign of ornamentation found inside the tombs; a small break in the south-western wall connects it with the northernmost loculus of No. 2. Furthest north are three bevel-holes, noting the beginning of a catacomb; and round the northern flank of the detached cone are six separate caves, all laid waste by the furious northern gales.|$|E
