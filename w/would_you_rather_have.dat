500|$|The {{final act}} of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent's Super - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's street {{drinkers}} on Christmas Day 1995. [...] However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, {{many of whom were}} in homeless shelters for the day. [...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?"

He filed {{at least twenty}} similar lawsuits {{in the years following}} and achieved verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million for his clients. Similar lawsuits followed across the country. When asked about an increase in Caesarean deliveries nationwide, perhaps to avoid similar medical malpractice lawsuits, Edwards said, [...] "The question is, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> cases where that happens instead of having cases where you don't intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero?" ...|$|E

So the {{equipage}} {{drove to}} his hotel in Covent Garden, where the landlord came forward with his usual obsequiousness, and recognising my Lord of March and Ruglen, bowed his wig on to my lord's shoes in his humble welcomes to his lordship. A rich young English peer in the reign of George the Second; a wealthy patrician in the reign of Augustus; which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> been?

6000|$|In {{the morning}} Hector said: [...] "Now, Madame de Blenfoix, I have been {{thinking}} the matter over, and consider {{that it would be}} a wholly unnecessary journey and a loss of four days were you to travel to Nancy with us. You are only ten days' journey from Poitou, and I should advise you to start at once. My man, Paolo, and two of the troopers will accompany you as an escort. Your road will lead through Orleans, which will be almost halfway, and you will also pass through Tours. At both these towns you can, if you will, stay for a day to rest. I will ride down with you into Blenfoix, where I shall be able to get paper and pens, and will write letters to Captain MacIntosh and to my intendant explaining exactly the position that you will occupy. One of the troopers will ride forward with these from your last halting place before you arrive there, in order that you may find everything prepared and be received properly on your arrival. Do you both ride, or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a pillion's place behind the troopers?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed I {{am sorry}} {{you have this}} bustle, and so many to entertain, when I know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the {{peaceful}} feelings belonging to the day undisturbed. I should like to shelter you up here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is it {{my fault}} that I {{am the only}} man for their purposes? What angry {{nonsense}} are you talking, mother? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> me timid and foolish, selling water-melons on the market-place or rowing a boat for passengers along the harbour, like a soft Neapolitan without courage or reputation? Would you have a young man live like a monk? I do not believe it. Would you want a monk for your eldest girl? Let her grow. What are you afraid of? You have been angry with me for everything I did for years; ever since you first spoke to me, in secret from old Giorgio, about your Linda. Husband to one and brother to the other, did you say? Well, why not! I like the little ones, and a man must marry some time. But ever since that time you have been making little of me to everyone. Why? Did {{you think you could}} put a collar and chain on me as if I were one of the watch-dogs they keep over there in the railway yards? Look here, Padrona, I am the same man who came ashore one evening and sat down in the thatched ranche you lived in at that time {{on the other side of}} the town and told you all about himself. You were not unjust to me then. What has happened since? I am no longer an insignificant youth. A good name, Giorgio says, is a treasure, Padrona." ...|$|E
6000|$|My love! nay, rather, my damnation thou, [...] Said he: nor am I {{bound to}} keep my vow: [...] The fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below, [...] Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know? [...] 330 [...] Avaunt, old witch! for I renounce thy bed: [...] The queen may take the forfeit of my head, [...] Ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed. [...] Both heard, the judge {{pronounced}} against the knight; [...] So was he married in his own despite; [...] And all day after hid him as an owl, [...] Not able to sustain a sight so foul. [...] Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong, [...] To pass the marriage feast, and nuptial song: [...] Mirth there was none, the man was a-la-mort, [...] 340 [...] And little courage had to make his court. [...] To bed they went, the bridegroom and the bride: [...] Was never such an ill-pair'd couple tied, [...] Restless, he toss'd and tumbled to and fro, [...] And roll'd, and wriggled further off, for woe. [...] The good old wife lay smiling by his side, [...] And caught him in her quivering arms, and cried, [...] When you my ravish'd predecessor saw, [...] You were not then become this man of straw; [...] Had you been such, you might have 'scaped the law. [...] 350 [...] Is this the custom of King Arthur's court? [...] Are all round-table knights of such a sort? [...] Remember, I am she who saved your life, [...] Your loving, lawful, and complying wife: [...] Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour, [...] Nor I for this return employ'd my power. [...] In time of need I was your faithful friend; [...] Nor did I since, nor ever will offend. [...] Believe me, my loved lord, 'tis much unkind; [...] What fury has possess'd your alter'd mind? [...] 360 [...] Thus on my wedding night--without pretence-- [...] Come turn this way, or tell me my offence. [...] If not your wife, let reason's rule persuade; [...] Name but my fault, amends shall soon be made. [...] Amends! nay, that's impossible, said he, [...] What change of age or ugliness can be? [...] Or could Medea's magic mend thy face, [...] Thou art descended from so mean a race, [...] That never knight was match'd with such disgrace. [...] What wonder, madam, if I move my side, [...] 370 [...] When, if I turn, I turn to such a bride? [...] And is this all that troubles you so sore? [...] And what the devil couldst thou wish me more? [...] Ah, Benedicite, replied the crone; [...] Then cause of just complaining have you none. [...] The remedy to this were soon applied, [...] Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride: [...] But, for you say a long descended race, [...] And wealth and dignity, and power and place, [...] Make gentlemen, and that your high degree [...] 380 [...] Is much disparaged to be match'd with me; [...] Know this, my lord, nobility of blood [...] Is but a glittering and fallacious good: [...] The nobleman is he, whose noble mind [...] Is fill'd with inborn worth, unborrow'd from his kind. [...] The King of Heaven was in a manger laid, [...] And took his earth but from an humble maid; [...] Then what can birth, or mortal men, bestow? [...] Since floods no higher than their fountains flow. [...] We, who for name and empty honour strive, [...] 390 [...] Our true nobility from him derive. [...] Your ancestors, who puff your mind with pride, [...] And vast estates to mighty titles tied, [...] Did not your honour, but their own, advance; [...] For virtue comes not by inheritance. [...] If you tralineate from your father's mind, [...] What are you else but of a bastard kind? [...] Do, as your great progenitors have done, [...] And, by their virtues, prove yourself their son. [...] No father can infuse or wit or grace; [...] 400 [...] A mother comes across, and mars the race. [...] A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood; [...] And seldom three descents continue good. [...] Were virtue by descent, a noble name [...] Could never villanise his father's fame; [...] But, as the first, the last of all the line, [...] Would, like the sun, even in descending shine; [...] Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house, [...] Betwixt King Arthur's court and Caucasus: [...] If you depart, the flame shall still remain, [...] 410 [...] And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain: [...] Nor, till the fuel perish, can decay, [...] By nature form'd on things combustible to prey. [...] Such is not man, who, mixing better seed [...] With worse, begets a base degenerate breed: [...] The bad corrupts the good, and leaves behind [...] No trace of all the great begetter's mind. [...] The father sinks within his son, we see, [...] And often rises in the third degree; [...] If better luck a better mother give, [...] 420 [...] Chance gave us being, and by chance we live. [...] Such as our atoms were, even such are we, [...] Or call it chance, or strong necessity: [...] Thus loaded with dead weight, the will is free. [...] And thus it needs must be; for seed conjoin'd [...] Lets into nature's work the imperfect kind; [...] But fire, the enlivener of the general frame, [...] Is one, its operation still the same. [...] Its principle is in itself: while ours [...] Works, as confederates war, with mingled powers; [...] 430 [...] Or man or woman, which soever fails: [...] And oft the vigour of the worse prevails. [...] Aether with sulphur blended alters hue, [...] And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue. [...] Thus, in a brute, their ancient honour ends, [...] And the fair mermaid in a fish descends: [...] The line is gone; no longer duke or earl; [...] But, by himself degraded, turns a churl. [...] Nobility of blood is but renown [...] Of thy great fathers by their virtue known, [...] 440 [...] And a long trail of light, to thee descending down. [...] If in thy smoke it ends, their glories shine; [...] But infamy and villanage are thine. [...] Then what I said before is plainly show'd, [...] The true nobility proceeds from God; [...] Nor left us by inheritance, but given [...] By bounty of our stars, and grace of Heaven. [...] Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose, [...] Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose: [...] Fabricius from their walls repell'd the foe, [...] 450 [...] Whose noble hands had exercised the plough. [...] From hence, my lord, and love, I thus conclude, [...] That though my homely ancestors were rude, [...] Mean as I am, yet I may have the grace [...] To make you father of a generous race: [...] And noble then am I, when I begin, [...] In virtue clothed, to cast the rags of sin. [...] If poverty be my upbraided crime, [...] And you believe in Heaven, {{there was a time}} [...] When He, the great controller of our fate, [...] 460 [...] Deign'd to be man, and lived in low estate; [...] Which He who had the world at his dispose, [...] If poverty were vice, would never choose. [...] Philosophers have said, and poets sing, [...] That a glad poverty's an honest thing. [...] Content is wealth, the riches of the mind; [...] And happy he who can that treasure find. [...] But the base miser starves amidst his store, [...] Broods on his gold, and, griping still at more, [...] Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor. [...] 470 [...] The ragged beggar, though he want relief, [...] Has not to lose, and sings before the thief. [...] Want is a bitter and a hateful good, [...] Because its virtues are not understood; [...] Yet many things, impossible to thought, [...] Have been by need to full perfection brought: [...] The daring of the soul proceeds from thence, [...] Sharpness of wit, and active diligence: [...] Prudence at once, and fortitude, it gives, [...] And, if in patience taken, mends our lives; [...] 480 [...] For even that indigence, that brings me low, [...] Makes me myself, and Him above, to know. [...] A good which none would challenge, few would choose, [...] A fair possession, which mankind refuse. [...] If we from wealth to poverty descend, [...] Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend. [...] If I am old and ugly, well for you, [...] No lewd adulterer will my love pursue; [...] Nor jealousy, the bane of married life, [...] Shall haunt you for a wither'd homely wife; [...] 490 [...] For age and ugliness, as all agree, [...] Are the best guards of female chastity. [...] Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent, [...] I'll do my best to further your content. [...] And therefore of two gifts in my dispose, [...] Think ere you speak, I grant you leave to choose: [...] Would you I should be still deform'd and old, [...] Nauseous to touch, and loathsome to behold; [...] On this condition to remain for life, [...] A careful, tender, and obedient wife, [...] 500 [...] In all I can contribute to your ease, [...] And not in deed, or word, or thought displease: [...] Or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> me young and fair, [...] And take the chance that happens to your share? [...] Temptations are in beauty, and in youth, [...] And how can you depend upon my truth? [...] Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss, [...] And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.|$|E

50|$|Thus, for example, in his Ethics of Memory he {{uses the}} case of an officer who forgets the name of one of his {{subordinate}} soldiers who was killed in a heroic battle, as a test-case for discussing the issue of the moral responsibility that attaches to memory, on the one hand, and of the centrality of names in constituting memory, on the other. He also poses the following dilemma: were you a painter, would you prefer your paintings to survive you after your death, even if your name will be forgotten, or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> your name remembered even if none of your paintings survive.

5000|$|The play {{is set in}} {{the cafe}} [...] "chez Francis" [...] in the Place de l'Alma in the Chaillot {{district}} of Paris. A group of corrupt corporate executives are meeting. They include the Prospector, the President, the Broker and the Baron, and they are planning to dig up Paris to get at the oil which they believe lies beneath its streets. Their nefarious plans come to the attention of Countess Aurelia, the benignly eccentric madwoman of the title. She is an aging idealist who sees the world as happy and beautiful. But, advised by her associate, the Ragpicker, who is a bit more worldly than the Countess, she soon comes to realize that the world might well be ruined by these evil men—men who seek only wealth and power. These people have taken over Paris. [...] "They run everything, they corrupt everything," [...] says the Ragpicker. Already things have gotten so bad that the pigeons do not bother to fly any more.
