50|$|An {{alternate}} design, {{called the}} <b>wound</b> <b>rotor,</b> is used when variable speed is required.

Carbon brushes connect the slip rings to a controller such as a variable resistor that allows changing the motor's slip rate.

The {{main reason for}} their popularity when connected to the electrical network is their ability to supply power at constant voltage and frequency while the rotor speed varies, which makes it suitable for applications with variable speed. We consider in this paper the isolated operation of a DFIG driven by a prime mover, with its stator connected to a load [...] which is in this case an IM. This paper presents a dynamic model of the DFIG-IM and proves that this system is Blondel-Park transformable. It is also shown that the zero dynamics is unstable for a certain operating regime. We propose and analyse different strategies for {{the control of the}} whole system mainly based on Passivity Based Control (PBC). Several of them have been implemented on a 200 W DFIG interconnected with an IM prototype available in IRII-UPC (Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics - UPC - Barcelona). The main disadvantage of the DFIG is the slip rings, which reduce the life time of the machine and increases the maintenance costs. To overcome this drawback an alternative machine arrangement is proposed which is the Brushless Doubly Fed twin Induction Generator (BDFTIG). The system is anticipated as an advanced solution to the conventional doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The proposed BDFTIG employs two cascaded induction machines each consisting of two <b>wound</b> <b>rotors,</b> connected in cascade to eliminate the brushes and copper rings in the DFIG.

40|$|Abstract- Rotating {{electrical}} machines {{play an important}} role in the world’s industrial life. Hence there is a strong demand on their reliable and safe operation. Their faults and failures can lead to excessive downtimes and generate enormous costs in reduced output, emergency maintenance and lost revenues.

The biggest disadvantage {{associated with the}} use of SER drives is the vulnerability of the rotor circuit converters to power system disturbances such as voltage dips. The failure of converters as a result of voltage dips is a problem {{associated with the use}} of these particular drives. The aim of this research is to better understand the stresses on rotor circuit converters as a result of voltage dips at the terminals of the motor. The rotor transients developed by a <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> induction motor are investigated for a range of three phase and single phase voltage dips. Simulations conducted in the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) supplement measurements conducted on a simplified SER circuit.

50|$|Induction (asynchronous) motor, {{the rotor}} {{magnetic}} field {{is created by}} an induced current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are squirrel-cage <b>rotor,</b> <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> and solid core rotor.|$|R
40|$|Being the workhorse, {{induction}} motors {{are serving}} the industry. Mostly {{we can see}} squirrel cage motors, but when it's come to the large industries, <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> induction motors are also there. Applications like Mills, Large Fans, Pumps, Blowers, Crushers and Overhead Cranes which require higher starting torques use <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> induction motors {{to have a higher}} starting torque at a lower starting current at the stator. Generally <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> induction motors require more maintenance than squirrel cage motors because of its rotor construction, slip ring assembly and the starting method used. Conventionally, <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> motors use an external resistor bank, which is connected to the rotor winding via slip rings, and external rotor resistance varies from a maximum value to zero as the rotor speed develops. Varying the external resistance can be achieved by several electromechanical methods. This is done in a stepwise manner with a motorized camshaft with electromechanical contact points or with a set of electrical power contactors and timers having a suitable time delay between adjacent steps. The traditional starter is highly mechanical and can cause lot of startup delays and is bulkier and requires frequent maintenance. To ensure right operation of rotor resistance control, the motor control circuit incorporates several additional measures and these are too prone to failures due to their own nature. Due to high heat dissipation in the resistors the number of consecutive startups during a short time period is also limited. The proposed power electronic starter is entirely a power electronic device, which is having a three-phase rectifier bridge and a programmable transistor chopper. Programmable transistor chopper ensures a gradual speed development at rotor and control the acceleration with the duty factor of the transistor. This could eliminate the major disadvantage of traditional starter, which is the dependability of rotor speed with the load torque by extending it to have a closed loop speed control. Thereby we can ensure the programmable torque-speed characteristics with this power electronic starter. This power electronic development will minimize the overall maintenance, and avoid current fluctuations completely during speed changes while demanding speed up or down at the rotor. This report discusses the proposal, simulations in prone to the construction, hardware design and practical implementation and testing of starter with a no load <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> motor. Latter part of the report shows the performances of new starter over the conventional starter and future developments possible...|$|R

In these applications, {{there is a growing}} desire to improve machine efficiency in order to reduce fossil fuel requirements. In addition, there is a desire to reduce mass to improve mobility.
