The Wright Brothers used a yaw string on their 1902 glider tied on their front mounted elevator. Wilbur Wright is credited with its invention, having applied it concurrently with the movable rudder invented by his brother Orville in October 1902, responded, [...] "Yes...we will install a short piece of string out front where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> This string will tell us all we need to know!"

2500|$|We {{believe them}} deluded fanatics, or weak and {{designing}} knaves, {{and that they}} and their pretensions would soon pass away; but in this we were deceived. The arts of a few designing leaders amongst them have less far succeeded in holding to them together as a society; and since {{the arrival of the}} first of them, they have been daily increasing numbers; and if they had been respectable citizens in society and thus deluded it would have been entitled to our pity rather than to our contempt and hatred; but from their parents, from their manners, and from their conduct since their coming among us, we have every reason to fear that, with but very few exceptions, they were of the very drags of that society from which they came, lazy, idle, and vicious. This <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> is not idle assertion, they fact susceptible of proof, or with these few exceptions above-named, they brought into our country little or no property with them and left less behind them, and we infer that those only yoked themselves to the [...] "Mormon" [...] car who had nothing earthly or heavenly to lose by the change; and we fear that of some of the leaders amongst them, had paid to forfeit due to crime, instead of being chosen ambassadors of the Most High, they would have been inmates of solitary cells. But their conduct here stands their characters in their true colors. More than a year since, it was ascertained that they had been tampering with our slaves, and endeavoring to sow dissensions and raise seditions amongst them. Of this their [...] "Mormon" [...] leaders were informed, and they said they would deal with any of their members who should again in like case offend. But how spacious are appearances. In a late number of the Star, published in Independence by the leaders of the sect, there is an article inviting free Negroes and mulattoes from other states to become [...] "Mormons," [...] and remove and settle among us. This exhibits them in still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of their society, to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to us entirely insupportable, and one of the surest means of driving us from the country; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a caste among us would corrupt our blacks, and instigate them to bloodshed.|$|E
