40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to explore the hypothesis that settled dust in a domestic environment can contain significant levels of allergens and that common cleaning methods employed to remove dust can result in sufficient airborne exposure to potentially trigger an allergic reaction. Qualitative feedback from respondents in studies of furniture dusting habits indicated that household furniture dusting could elicit an allergic response. A consumer questionnaire was fielded to confirm the problem and it's magnitude. This indicated that it affected approximately 20 % of allergy sufferers (or approximately 5 % of the total UK population). Further work was performed to estimate the level of allergen exposure during dusting. Additional consumer research was fielded to ascertain the surface area being dusted, (approximately 54000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas and 10000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas). Domestic dusting habits were probed for the relative frequency of dusting method, which split evenly between dry dusting, <b>wet</b> <b>dusting</b> with water and <b>wet</b> <b>dusting</b> with a furniture polish. Surface sampling techniques were adapted to make in-home measurements of the rate of dust settling which {{was found to be}} approximately 3. 19 x 10 - 7 g. cm- 2,day- 1. In-home sampling was also undertaken to measure the mean allergen content of surface dust for major allergens, yielding 24667 ng. g- 1 combined dust mite, 47696 ng. g- 1 Fel d 1 and approximately 126 8 08 ng. g- 1 Can f 1. Laboratory-based studies determined the relative amount of dust rendered airborne during dusting of different furniture surface types and comparing different cleaning methods. This was found to be between 2. 3 - 43. 0 %. From these experiments, a model "average" home was constructed and used to estimate the exposure towards dust allergens during a typical dusting task. Exposure was estimated to be as much as 16500 ng total dust mite, 124000 mug (31000 mU) cat allergen and 275000 ng (IU) dog allergen per dusting method. These results indicated that allergen exposure, under certain circumstances, could exceed the threshold levels that have been proposed for the onset of sensitisation...|$|E

The use of high- effective dust capturing devices, reducing leakage degree of dust particles thrown out from aspiration cutting dust schemes {{is one of the most}} promising and effective ways to decrease dust emissions at the cement producing enterprises. The article shows some summary results of the field power determination for dust emission, dust of sand and expanded clay, leak out of equipment, workplaces and aspiration schemes of expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. The results of the analysis of dust particles with various dimensions and the experimental determination of the degree of dust separating apparatuses’ leaking out was used for design and development of the new <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> cleaner -separator.

30|$|Selection of dust {{collector}} depends {{much on the}} dust type, effectiveness, cost, size, maintenance, etc. Beside meeting the requirement of the national work health standard, {{dust collector}}s used in tunneling must {{also be able to}} collect the dust with a diameter between 0.4 and 0.5  μm, workable in an environment with relative humidity of 90  % or above, and occupy a smaller space. Three type of dust collectors meet the above requirements including <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> collector, bag dust collector, and franklinic dust collector. Compared to the other two types of collectors, the bag dust collector has advantages of high effectiveness, smaller space occupying, higher stability and reliability, lower noise, and easier maintenance.

30|$|The {{particle}} {{removal efficiency}} of the bag filter in case 3 {{was similar to that}} of the hybrid ESP/BAG of cases 5 and 6. All of these devices have removal efficiencies of 99  % or more on particles with different sizes. These removal efficiencies are significantly higher than those of the ESPs in cases 1 and 2, particularly in terms of the removal effect of PM 2.5. A Venturi water film dust precipitator is a wet precipitator in which the removal of particles by droplets is accomplished mainly through inertial collision, interception and cohesion between particles and droplets. Thus, the particle removal efficiency of this precipitator is a relatively low 95  %– 97  %, as shown in Fig.  4. However, with the existence of droplets, small particles agglomerate in a wet precipitator. Thus, the removal {{efficiency of the}} <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> collector for fine particles less than 1 μm is not low, and is between that of bag filters and the ESP.|$|R

40|$|Worker {{exposure}} to coal dust in underground mines remains a major health hazard. This research has: 1) Analyzed the wetting characteristics {{of less than}} 10 micron dust particles using a novel micro-emulsion technology (MET) at bench scale and prototype scale with emphasis on agglomeration of dust particles, and 2) Simulate airflow and dust dispersion patterns on a longwall mining face using CFD modeling techniques to compare the current and proposed spatial distributions of water sprays around a longwall shearer. With the “Final Dust Rule” adopted by MSHA in 2014 and slated to go into full effect August 16, 2016, this research is {{a significant contribution to}} the coal industry. A suitable micro-emulsion containing 0. 2 % oil and 0. 0125 % didodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB) was identified. For assessing the wettability of coal dusts, a slightly modified version of “Fixed Time Wettability” or FTW (Chugh et al., 2004) was employed. These wettability tests however, did not yeild true wettability using the MET. An analysis for both unwetted and wetted portions of coal dust using particle size distribution curves (PSD) confirmed agglomeration when treated with the emulsion. For the unwetted portion, 96. 6 % of the particles had sizes greater than 25 μm after treatment with MET. Similar data for <b>wetted</b> <b>dust</b> was 100 %. Experiemental studies in a 4 ft x 4 ft x 10 ft chamber showed 12 - 15 % improvement in respirable dust when using MET as compared to water alone [...] Validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used to study airflow patterns and the interaction between sprays and airflow for designing both engineering and administrative controls around a longwall face. Two important zones – low air velocity (LAV) and recirculation (RC) – were identified around the model of a longwall face. These zones were located: 1) Behind the headgate drum and 2) Above the shearer chassis. Analysis of a modified geometric configuration of sprays on the shearer chassis showed improved coverage for <b>wetting</b> the <b>dust</b> on the longwall face. Numerical modeling comparisons were made between current spray systems and spray systems proposed by Dr. Y. P. Chugh using the concepts of “Continuous and Discrete Phase Modeling”. Analyses included changes in airflow patterns caused by spray systems and dust dispersion tracks generated from the cutting face. Chugh’s spray system was able to effectively eliminate RC zones existing above the shearer body, thereby minimizing the extent to which coal dust enters the walkway of the longwall face where workers are located. The proposed spray system used concepts of multiple <b>wetting</b> points for <b>dust,</b> air-locks, and venturi to <b>wet</b> the <b>dust</b> and direct the dust-laden air from mine workers. These improvements can be used in longwall mines as engineering controls for meeting new dust control standards...|$|R

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{elemental}} composition of sinking particles in sediment traps {{and in the}} water column following four artificial dust seeding experiments (each representing a flux of 10 g m − 2). Dry or <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> deposition were simulated during two large mesocosms field campaigns {{that took place in the}} coastal water of Corsica (NW Mediterranean Sea) representative of oligotrophic conditions. The dust additions were carried out with fresh or artificially aged dust (i. e., enriched in nitrate and sulfate by mimicking cloud processing) for various biogeochemical conditions, enabling us to test the effect of these parameters on the chemical composition and settling of dust after deposition. The rates and mechanisms of total mass, particulate organic carbon (POC) and chemical elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Nd, P, S, Sr and Ti) transfer from the mesocosm surface to the sediment traps installed at the base of the mesocosms after dust deposition show that (1) 15 % of the initial dust mass was dissolved {{in the water column}} in the first 24 h after seeding. Except for Ca, S and N, the elemental composition of dust particles was constant during their settling, showing the relevance of using interelemental ratios, such as Ti/Al as proxy of lithogenic fluxes. (2) Whatever the type of seeding (using fresh dust to simulate dry deposition or artificially aged <b>dust</b> to simulate <b>wet</b> deposition), the particulate phase both in the water column and in the sediment traps was dominated by dust particles. (3) Due to the high Ba content in dust, Ba/Al cannot be used as productivity proxy in the case of high dust input in the sediment traps. Instead, our data suggests that the ratio Co/Al could be a good productivity proxy in this case. (4) After 7 days, between 30 and 68 % of added dust was still in suspension in the mesocosms. This difference in the dust settling was directly associated with a difference in POC export, since POC fluxes were highly correlated to dust lithogenic fluxes signifying a ballast effect of dust. The highest fraction of remaining dust in suspension in the mesocosm at the end of the experiment was found inversely correlated to Chl a increase. This suggests that the fertilizing effect of dust on autotrophs organisms, the ballast effect, and POC fluxes are strongly correlated.

Data on phytoplankton, chlorophyll a, nutrients, temperature and salinity were obtained at bi-weekly or more intense intervals during 1 yr, whilst transport of Saharan dust towards the sampling region was monitored daily by SeaWiFS (sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor) images. Diatoms were the group of highest average biomass during the entire investigation period. Although coccolithophores (mainly Emiliania huxleyi) numerically dominated at the open station during the study period, their maximum abundance was as low as 50 × 103 cells. The intensity of dust transport was observed to be highest in spring. Less intense transports were observed in summer and autumn. Several intense episodic dry and <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> deposition events during the spring season observed by SeaWiFS images caused little or no increase in phytoplankton abundance and biomass in the following days and weeks. Nevertheless, it appears that less intense dust transport events increased phytoplankton abundance and biomass in August, September and October 2001, when water column stratification was at its peak. However, these increases were much weaker than the major winter-early spring bloom (in February and March), which was caused by upwelling, mixing the water column.

No changes in primary production (PP) and chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a) were observed after a dry deposition event, while a wet deposition event resulted in a rapid (24 h after dust addition), strong (up to 2. 4 -fold) and long (at least a week in duration) increase in PP and Chl a. We show that, {{in addition to being a}} source of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), simulated wet deposition events were also a significant source of nitrate (NO 3 −) (net increases up to + 9. 8 μM NO 3 − at 0. 1 m in depth) to the nutrient-depleted surface waters, due to cloud processes and mixing with anthropogenic species such as HNO 3. The dry deposition event was shown to be a negligible source of NO 3 −. By transiently increasing DIP and NO 3 - concentrations in N–P starved surface waters, wet deposition of Saharan dust was able to relieve the potential N or NP co-limitation of the phytoplanktonic activity. Due to the higher input of NO 3 − relative to DIP, and taking into account the stimulation of the biological activity, a wet deposition event resulted in a strong increase in the NO 3 − /DIP ratio, from initially less than 6, to over 150 at the end of the DUNE- 2 -R 1 experiment, suggesting a switch from an initial N or NP co-limitation towards a severe P limitation.

40|$|Materials {{used in the}} {{construction}} industry frequently contain large quantities of silica. When they are cut or shaped with power tools considerable respirable dust can be produced. Three dust control systems for use with cut-o saws have been evaluated on site: <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> suppression using mains water, the same system using water from a portable water tank, and local exhaust ventilation. The eciency of water suppression on cut-o saws has been precisely quantified in controlled laboratory conditions by means of measurements with and without dust control. When dust control was used on-site, the mean concentrations of airborne silica were reduced by a factor of between three and seven, the accuracy being limited by the relatively high limit of detection for silica. All controls systems generally reduced respirable dust levels by at least 90 %. Although the eectiveness of dust suppression did not depend on blade type, a diamond blade was more eective than a resin-bonded blade with the pressurised water system; cutting a slab with this type of blade could be completed before the water tank required repressurisation. In laboratory tests, the application of water reduced the dust concentration to < 4 % of its value without control. The method for monitoring the dust concentration was suciently sensitive to measure a dierence in concentration produced during cutting in dierent directions. It is important, however, that the pressure in supply reservoirs is properly maintained, that the water is correctly applied and that it is used at the correct rate.

40|$|Analyzed {{the system}} of drying plant air cleaning, specializing in the {{production}} of food powders, dust emission identified place in the shop drying {{in the production of}} soluble dietary powders, the parameters of the dryer exhaust coolant, analyzed the properties of the product, as well as determined the effectiveness of the use of air purification equipment. Analyzed used at the enterprise two-stage cleaning system. As a first purification stage conical cyclone installed as a second stage purification analyzed dust collector is proposed with internal circulation of the liquid. It was found that the drying of the powder contained in the emissions of {{a large proportion of the}} fine fraction of dust. Several studies have been conducted with this food dust. It was found that the collection efficiency in the cyclone ranged from 68 % (tea dust) to 92 % (dust kvass wort). Analyzing the data obtained indicated that the efficiency of cleaning exhaust coolant is heavily dependent on the food composition of disperse dust, and less than 10 microns particles is insufficient. It is proposed to use for cleaning the coolant <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> collector with internal circulation of the liquid. The regularities of change of concentration of solids in the cleaning liquid, its viscosity and surface tension with increasing operating time since the start of the dust collector. It is found that increasing the concentration of solids in the cleaning liquid increases with the operating time of the machine since the start-up leads to changes in surface tension and viscosity of the liquid. It is shown that the effective dust collection in the machine decreases as the viscosity of the working fluid. Both theoretically and experimentally established patterns may be used when calculating the optimum specific liquid flow to provide effective cleaning and releases the trapped product return process cycle...|$|R

Any droplets {{that are in}} the scrubber inlet gas must be separated from the outlet gas stream by means of another device referred to as a mist eliminator or entrainment separator (these terms are interchangeable). Also, the resultant scrubbing liquid must be treated prior to any ultimate discharge or being reused in the plant.|$|R

40|$|Saharan dust was {{observed}} over the Caribbean basin {{during the summer}} 2007 NASA Tropical Composition, Cloud, and Climate Coupling (TC 4) field experiment. Airborne Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) and satellite observations from MODIS suggest a barrier to dust transport across Central America into the eastern Pacific. We use the NASA GEOS- 5 atmospheric transport model with online aerosol tracers to perform simulations of the TC 4 time period {{in order to understand}} the nature of this barrier. Our simulations are driven by the Modem Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological analyses. We evaluate our baseline simulated dust distributions using MODIS and CALIOP satellite and ground-based AERONET sun photometer observations. GEOS- 5 reproduces the observed location, magnitude, and timing of major dust events, but our baseline simulation does not develop as strong a barrier to dust transport across Central America as observations suggest. Analysis of the dust transport dynamics and lost processes suggest that while both mechanisms play a role in defining the dust transport barrier, loss processes by <b>wet</b> removal of <b>dust</b> are about twice as important as transport. Sensitivity analyses with our model showed that the dust barrier would not exist without convective scavenging over the Caribbean. The best agreement between our model and the observations was obtained when <b>dust</b> <b>wet</b> removal was parameterized to be more aggressive, treating the dust as we do hydrophilic aerosols...|$|R
