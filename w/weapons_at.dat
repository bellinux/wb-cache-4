5|$|At E3 2017 Bethesda {{announced}} Doom VFR, {{a virtual}} reality adaptation of Doom, {{compatible with the}} PlayStation VR and HTC Vive headsets. In Doom VFR the players assumes the role of Mars' last survivor who, after being killed, gets his consciousness uploaded into an artificial network, and is tasked with defeating the demons and restoring the facility's operations, having an array of electronic devices and <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> his disposal. The game is scheduled for release on December 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|By October 1866, {{orders were}} given to the Ordnance Sergeant at Fort Corcoran to compile a {{complete}} list of all the <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> the fort in order to assist in their final movement to the Washington Arsenal or other permanent forts. Shortly afterward, the fort was dismantled and the land returned to its original owner.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{established}} the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) on June 4, 1976. MTPD police officers have jurisdiction and arrest powers for crimes that occur throughout the 1,500 square mile (3,900km2) Transit Zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In December 2010, MTPD began conducting random searches of carry-on bags for explosive and <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> checkpoints located at randomly designated Metrorail stations.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the incendiary <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> destroying them.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce crime}} in Tombstone, on April 19, 1881, {{the city council}} passed {{ordinance}} 9, requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife, dirk, pistol or rifle to deposit their <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> a livery or saloon soon after entering town. The ordinance was the legal basis for City Marshal Virgil Earp's decision to confront the Cowboys {{on the day of}} the shootout.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from North Africa, No. 6 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution of their role from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and direct fire support <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> commando level. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E
5|$|During {{character}} creation, {{the player}} chooses a class: fighter, ranger, paladin, thief, bard, mage, cleric, druid, barbarian, monk, or sorcerer; {{the last three}} of which are new for the sequel. Different classes have different special abilities and restrictions; a thief character, for instance, can find and remove traps, but thieves have limitations on which weapons and armor they may use, and cannot be of lawful good alignment. Most classes also have a subset of kits, or specializations within a class, from which to choose. Kits have special advantages and, usually, disadvantages; for example, one of the kits of the paladin class, the cavalier, specializes in fighting monsters such as dragons and demons, but cannot use missile <b>weapons.</b> <b>At</b> {{some point in the}} game, the player may join or take over a stronghold. The type of stronghold is determined by the protagonist's class.|$|E

5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique {{character}} class, which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, that they can use. Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> once, by leveling up.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> {{the expense of}} other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E

5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons from science fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> a number of sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E
5|$|In combat, {{players can}} use {{long-range}} weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotgun. Players can scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. Players can upgrade <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> workbenches using collected items. Equipment {{such as health}} kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged {{through the use of}} health kits..|$|E

5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> it {{from the roof of}} a house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military <b>weapons</b> <b>at</b> the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
