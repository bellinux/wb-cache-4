For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E

Regenerative detectors <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> narrow-band signals, especially for CW and SSB which need a heterodyne oscillator or BFO. A superregenerative detector {{does not have}} a usable heterodyne oscillator - even though the superregen always self-oscillates, so CW (Morse code)and SSB (single side band) signals can't be received properly.|$|R

Furthermore, hyperparameter values that <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> cross-entropy training with hard targets also <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> soft targets, in our experience. One other slight modification is that early stopping is performed by monitoring the cross-entropy cost with soft targets from the teacher on a development set, rather than the frame classification rate or cross-entropy cost with hard aligned targets.|$|R

25|$|This method <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> cubic and quartic equations, but Lagrange did {{not succeed}} in {{applying}} it to a quintic equation, because it requires solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six.

Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.|$|E

25|$|A {{molecule}} is {{the smallest}} indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However, this definition only <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.|$|E

25|$|Aomame is sexually promiscuous, and {{sometimes}} releases stress {{by going to}} singles bars and picking up older men. During one of these outings, she meets Ayumi, a policewoman who also has sex to relieve stress. They start to combine their efforts, which <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> them both. Aomame's close friendship with Ayumi makes her recall an earlier friend of hers who {{was the victim of}} domestic abuse and committed suicide because of it. Aomame and Ayumi remain friends until one day when Aomame reads in the newspaper that Ayumi had been strangled to death in a hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} ecohydrology is {{concerned}} with the interaction between ecosystems and water cycling, from measuring the small scale drainage of water into soil to tracking the broad movements of water evaporating off from trees. Because deuterium acts as a conservative tracer, it <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> tracking water movement through plants and ecosystems. Although water movement in single-process phenomena such as evaporation is relatively simple to track, many systems (e.g. cloud forests) in the environment have multiple sources and tracking water movement becomes more complicated. Isotope spiking can also be done to determine water transport through soil and into plants via injection of deuterated water directly into the ground.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger {{up and down on the}} fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E

25|$|Tigrinya {{is closely}} related to Amharic and Tigre, another Afroasiatic {{language}} spoken by the Tigre people as well as many Beja. Tigrinya and Tigre although close are not mutually intelligible, and while Tigrinya has traditionally been written using the same Ge'ez alphabet (fidel) as Amharic, Tigre has been transcribed mainly using the Arabic script. Attempts by the Eritrean government to have Tigre written using the Ge'ez script has met with some resistance from the predominantly Muslim Tigre people who associate Ge'ez with the Orthodox Church and would prefer the Arabic or the more neutral Latin alphabet. It has also met with the linguistic difficulty of the Ge'ez script being a syllabic system which does not distinguish long vowels from short ones. While this <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> writing Tigrinya or Amharic, which do not rely on vowel length in words, it does complicate writing Tigre, where vowel length sometimes distinguishes one word and its meaning from another. The Ge'ez script evolved from the Epigraphic South Arabian script, whose first inscriptions are from the 8th century BC in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Yemen.|$|E
25|$|The strangeness {{quantum number}} S (not to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds nonet figures). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb nonets. Because only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers only <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the nonets made of one u, one d and one other quark and breaks down for the other nonets (for example ucb nonet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, because they would all behave {{in exactly the same way}} with respect to the strong interaction. However, as quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E
25|$|Particle swarm {{optimization}} {{is another}} algorithm widely used {{to solve problems}} related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart and was first aimed at simulating the social behaviour and choreography of bird flocks and fish schools. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the problem space through successive generations using stochastic optimization {{to find the best}} solutions. The solutions it finds are called particles. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the best local value obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple mathematical rules. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications. A book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes some philosophical aspects of particle swarm optimization applications and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of applications is made by Poli.|$|E
