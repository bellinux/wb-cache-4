50|$|On November 16, 2010, a cold-core mid to upper-level trough {{in phase}} with a {{low-level}} <b>warm-core</b> <b>low</b> formed a system state in Brazil and moved southeastward into the South Atlantic, where it slightly deepened. The system brought locally heavy rains in southern Brazil and northeast of Uruguay that exceeded 200 millimeters {{in a few}} hours in some locations of Southern Rio Grande do Sul northwest of Pelotas. Damages and flooding were observed in Cerrito, São Lourenço do Sul and Pedro Osório. Bañado de Pajas, departament of Cerro Largo in Uruguay, recorded 240 mm of rain. The subtropical cyclone then became a weak trough on November 19, according to the CPTEC.|$|E
50|$|This Barotropic {{vorticity}} equation assumes {{the atmosphere is}} nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, there is no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and <b>warm-core</b> <b>lows</b> (such as tropical cyclones).|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of medicanes often {{results from the}} vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well, resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding {{with an increase in}} relative humidity, creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. This, in turn, leads to in an increase in potential energy, producing heat-induced air-sea instability. Moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts—the vertically downward movement of air—which often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones, and in such a scenario, wind shear remains minimal; overall, cold-core cut-off lows serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced <b>warm-core</b> <b>lows</b> such as medicanes. The regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of Mediterranean tropical cyclones, however, indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter. Elevated sea surface temperatures, contrasting with cold atmospheric air, encourage atmospheric instability, especially within the troposphere.|$|R
5|$|Mediterranean {{cyclones}} {{have been}} compared to polar lows—cyclonic storms which typically develop in the far regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres—for their similarly small size and heat-related instability; however, while medicanes nearly always feature <b>warm-core</b> <b>lows,</b> polar lows are primarily cold-core. The prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic-scale surface lows and heat-related instability. Heavy precipitation and convection within a developing Mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper-level trough—an elongated area of low air pressures—bringing downstream cold air, encircling an existing low-pressure system. After this occurs, however, a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization, coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well. Although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track, separation eventually occurs, usually in the later part of a Mediterranean tropical cyclone's life cycle. At the same time, moist air, saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere, then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone. Many of these characteristics are also evident in polar lows.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subtropical}} cyclones affected both Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul {{state in}} Brazil. On January 28, 2009, a cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level <b>warm-core</b> <b>low</b> formed a system and moved eastward into the South Atlantic. The storm produced rainfall in 24 hours of 300 mm {{or more in}} some locations of Rocha (Uruguay) and southern Rio Grande do Sul. The weather station owned by MetSul Weather Center in Morro Redondo, Southern Brazil, recorded 278.2 mm in a 24-hour period. Fourteen deaths and thousands of evacuees are attributed to the storm with an emergency declared in four cities. It lasted until February 1, when the cyclone became extratropical.|$|E
50|$|An area of low {{pressure}} formed {{on the southern}} extent of a stalled cold front just off the East Coast of the United States on July 16. Tracking south-southeast, the low-pressure center was initially baroclinic in nature, but quickly transitioned into a <b>warm-core</b> <b>low</b> over the warm waters of the western Atlantic. Decreasing vertical wind shear allowed for the development of convection - shower and thunderstorm activity - atop the low-level circulation, and Dvorak satellite classifications were initiated early on July 17 given the organization on satellite imagery. Following an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the disturbance that afternoon, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) subsequently classified the system as Tropical Depression Two at 18:00 UTC on July 17 about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. After about six hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bret.|$|E

50|$|Between 1200 UTC September 14 and 0000 UTC September 15, visible {{satellite}} {{imagery of the}} vortex revealed a resemblance to a tropical cyclone, with an eye-like feature about 19 miles (30 km) wide. In addition to the eye, convective clouds had also formed, creating the eyewall of a tropical cyclone. Furthermore, feeder bands of convective showers continued extending westward to about 310 miles (500 km). Soon after the cyclone passed buoy 45008, winds turned to the east-northeast and rapidly increased. In contrast to earlier in the storm's life, which had more energy in the high levels (like a cold-core low), now it was stronger near the surface (like a <b>warm-core</b> <b>low).</b> Surface analysis indicated that a weaker cyclonic circulation persisted over {{the eastern shore of}} Lake Huron with another center north of Lake Ontario. During this 12-hour period, the cyclone diminished rapidly, mainly in the lower troposphere. Twelve-hour height rises also occurred ranging from 66-197 feet (20-60 m). On September 15, the cyclone decayed and left Lake Huron.|$|E

These so-called coastal lows (CLs) occur up to five times per month in all seasons, although they are better defined from fall to spring. Marked weather changes along the coast and farther inland {{are associated with the}} transition from pressure drop to pressure rise. The mean structure and evolution of CLs is documented in this work, using a compositing analysis of 57 episodes selected from hourly pressure observations at a coastal station at 308 S during the austral winters of 1991, 1993, and 1994, and concurrent measurements from a regional research network of nine automatic weather stations, NCEP–NCAR reanalysis fields and high-resolution visible satellite imagery. Coastal lows tend to develop as a migratory surface anticyclone approaches southern Chile at about 408 S producing a poleward-oriented pressure gradient and geostrophically balanced offshore component in the low-level wind. At subtropical latitudes the transition from negative to positive geopotential anomalies occurs around 850 hPa. Enhanced mid- and lowlevel subsidence near the coast and downslope flow over the coastal range and Andes Mountains leads to the replacement of the cool, marine air by adiabatically warmed air, lowering the surface pressure at the coast and offshore. As the midlatitude ridge moves to the east of the Andes, the alongshore pressure gradient reverts back and the easterly wind ceases to act. The recovery of the surface pressure toward mean values occurs as the cool, cloud-topped MBL returns to the subtropical coast, although the pressure rise can be attenuated by midlatitude troughing. The return of the MBL resembles a Kelvin wave propagating along the coast from northern Chile (where the MBL eventually thickened) into subtropical latitudes in about a day...|$|E

If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately 5.5 km is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a geopotential height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|R
