2500|$|After {{brushing}} North Carolina, Hurricane Earl brought moderate {{rains and}} gusty winds {{to parts of}} Virginia. Although {{the center of the}} storm remained more than [...] offshore, wind gusts reached [...] in the state. Along the coast, large swells produced by the storm resulted in some beach erosion; however, no damage was reported. Throughout Delaware, the threat of Hurricane Earl lessened Labor Day <b>weekend</b> <b>tourism.</b> Many hotels across the state reached occupancies of 40-60%, significantly lower than initially expected. Along the coast, swells up to [...] resulted in minor tidal flooding, though no damage took place. Off the coast of New Jersey two people were killed after being swept out to sea by rip currents. The bodies of both victims were found after they washed onshore days after Earl's passage. The outer bands of Earl brought gusty winds and minimal rainfall, peaking at [...] in Chatsworth. Some beach erosion was reported along the coastline, with the worst being in Atlantic City. At the city's Garden Pier, the Historical Museum and the Atlantic City Arts Center was shut down indefinitely after electrical lines and pipes were damaged by waves. After nearly two weeks of beaches being shut down, swimmers were finally allowed to enter the water on September5 throughout New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, {{a two-week}} {{consultation}} process {{was held in}} order to determine if British Columbians preferred the holiday to fall on the second or third Monday in February. On May 28, 2012, it was announced that Family Day would be observed on the second Monday in February each year, starting February 11, 2013. As this does not coincide with Presidents Day, it also provides two consecutive long <b>weekends</b> for <b>tourism,</b> particularly at BC's many ski resorts.|$|R

A popular picnic and camping spot on <b>weekends,</b> housing and <b>tourism</b> {{developments}} {{around the area}} have been rapid {{in the past decade}} due to its proximity to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and the Sepang International Circuit.|$|R
50|$|Podujevo has its {{potentials}} {{concerning the}} tourism. It {{is characterized by}} many and various potentials for development of <b>weekend</b> and rural <b>tourism</b> as well. The geomorphology of Podujevo territory is quite rich. Two massive mountains, such as Albaniku and Gollaku mountains are located in Podujevo. Moreover, Llapi valley together with Llapi river, and the Batllava Lake provide incontestable values regarding the tourism.|$|R
50|$|Whilst the 1989 {{opening of}} the {{improved}} A361 connection to the motorway network helped in some ways to promote trade, notably <b>weekend</b> <b>tourism,</b> it had a detrimental effect {{on a number of}} distribution businesses. The latter had previously viewed the town as a base for local distribution networks, a need that was removed with an approximate halving of travelling time to the M5 motorway.|$|E
50|$|Miura {{is located}} on the very {{southern}} end of Miura Peninsula in southeast Kanagawa Prefecture, surrounded on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, with Sagami Bay to the west. To the south of the urban area and port is the island of Jōgashima, connected to the city by a bridge. It is a popular destination for <b>weekend</b> <b>tourism.</b> The Jōgashima Lighthouse was built by the French engineer Léonce Verny {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Due to Caroline’s compact size, {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped {{heavy rain}} the southern {{portion of the}} state, as much as 11.93in (302mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period {{during the month of}} August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest <b>weekends</b> for <b>tourism</b> on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1–4feet (0.3-1.2m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.|$|R

5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{assisted}} in coordinating preparations for Emily. The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment, previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in risk zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm {{that it would not}} create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day <b>weekend,</b> the <b>tourism</b> industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} cities on the lake's shores: Ohrid and Struga on the Macedonian side; Pogradec in Albania. There are also several fishing villages, {{although}} tourism {{is now a}} more significant part of their income. The catchment area of the lake {{has a population of}} around 170,000 people, with 131,000 people living directly at the lake shore (43,000 in Albania and 88,000 in Macedonia). The population in the catchment has increased greatly by 100,000 people in the last half century, putting the lake's fragile ecosystem under pressure. The historic monuments, as well as the pristine lake environment make the area around Lake Ohrid a prime site for tourism. In the 1980s, more than 200,000 national and international tourists went on a literal pilgrimage to the Macedonian lake side every year. During the Yugoslav crisis and particularly after the interethnic conflicts within Macedonia in 2001 international tourism collapsed but has been slowly recovering during the past years. Even though many of the above visitors are staying for a <b>weekend</b> only, <b>tourism</b> makes an important share of local economy (~1 visitor/inhabitant).|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is development of stag tourism as {{a trend in}} <b>tourism.</b> <b>Weekends</b> in Central and Eastern Europe countries for stag party celebration is {{getting more and more}} popular, mainly from the side of British tourists. The thesis is dedicated to the general development of the trend and its contribution and impact on Prague. First three chapters of the thesis concern the tourism theory, whereas the last three chapters cover practical information, including the analysis of the impact of stag tourism and results of a conducted research. ALso stag tourism is explored as a part of guiding services as guiding plays a very important role in the stag tours organization...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{variations}} in wastewater flows are common phenomena related to peak water use periods. However, {{few studies have}} examined high-resolution temporal variability in trace organic contaminant (TOrC) concentrations and loadings. Even fewer have assessed the impacts of a special event or holiday. This study characterizes the temporal variability associated with a major sporting event using flow data and corresponding mass loadings of a suite of prescription pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and illicit drugs. Wastewater influent and finished effluent samples were collected during the National Football League 2 ̆ 7 s Super Bowl, which is a significant <b>weekend</b> for <b>tourism</b> in the study area. Data from a baseline weekend is also provided to illustrate flows and TOrC loadings during 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 operational conditions. Some compounds exhibited interesting temporal variations (e. g., atenolol), and several compounds demonstrated different loading profiles during the Super Bowl and baseline weekends (e. g., the primary cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine). Interestingly, the influent mass loadings of prescription pharmaceuticals were generally similar in magnitude to those of the illicit drugs and their metabolites. However, conventional wastewater treatment was more effective in removing the illicit drugs and their metabolites. Total influent and effluent mass loadings are also provided to summarize treatment efficacy and environmental discharges...|$|R
50|$|Flag Day {{was created}} by law Nº 12,361, on June 8, 1938. Initially, it was a celebration held in a fixed day, but law Nº 24,445 {{modified}} it to be commemorated on the third Monday of the month. This design creates long <b>weekends</b> and boost <b>tourism.</b> Within the jurisdiction of Rosario, however, June 20 is always a non-working day for employees of the municipal and provincial administrations, and for all public and private schools. Hermes Binner made a project of law in 2006 to derogate this modification and restore both celebrations in fixed days, but the proposal expired because of not being treated by the Congress in a whole year. Nevertheless, Binner (governor of Santa Fe by then) and the mayor of Rosario, Miguel Lifschitz, insisted in the 2010 Flag Day that Congress should repeal the law and restore the commemoration to fixed days.|$|R
