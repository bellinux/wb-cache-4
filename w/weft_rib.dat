40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the color difference, whiteness, and luster of multifilament polyester woven fabrics based on weave pattern, weft density, dye concentration, and interaction between super bright warp yarns and semi dull weft yarns. Plain, <b>weft</b> <b>rib</b> (2 / 2), sateen (1 / 4) (3) and steep twill(2 / 3) {{was selected as}} weave pattern. Warp yarn type and its count, and warp density were kept constant. Measurement of whiteness was conducted on pre-treated un-dyed fabric samples. Color difference and luster of samples was evaluated after dying in warp and weft direction separately. Plain and <b>weft</b> <b>rib</b> (2 / 2) weaves showed the lowest and highest value of whiteness and luster respectively. Interaction between weave pattern and application of super bright yarn as warp was obtained in these parameters. The luster and whiteness of samples was decreased by increase in weft density. The trend of luster and color difference in weft and warp direction by increasing the weft density was not similar and was dependent on dye concentration and effectiveness of super bright warp yarns according to fabric pattern. Woven fabrics with steep twill (2 / 3) and <b>weft</b> <b>rib</b> (2 / 2) revealed the highest values of color difference compared with plain and sateen (1 / 4) (3) in warp direction. In weft direction, plain weave showed the lowest value of color difference and all three others had almost {{the same level of}} color difference. Moreover, the visual assessment was organized based on twenty-two observers in standard condition and D 65 light source...|$|E
40|$|The tear {{strength}} of a woven fabric is very important, since it is {{more closely related to}} serviceability of the fabric. Tearing strength of the fabrics depend on the mobility of the yarn within the fabric structure. In this study, the tearing strength of four types of fabrics warp rib, <b>weft</b> <b>rib,</b> ripstop and plain weave were analysed, which were produced in different densities and with filament and texturised polyester yarns...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge on the micro-structure of {{composites}} {{is important}} to investigate their mechanical properties such as the tensile stiffness. X-ray computer assisted tomography, often called X-ray CT scan, has been used here to characterise the micro-structure of <b>rib</b> <b>weft</b> knitted fabrics. This tomography technique provides three-dimensional images of <b>rib</b> <b>weft</b> knitted fabrics. The orientation of yarn segments is represented using second order (a(ij)) and fourth order (a(ijkl)) tensors. Micro-mechanical models {{with respect to the}} yam orientation were used to predict the stiffness properties of rib and milano knitted fabric composites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Resin Transfer Molded (RTM) {{laminates}} from <b>weft</b> <b>rib</b> knit glass preforms {{with added}} reinforcements were developed using closed mould vacuum resin suction technique. In all, six types of preforms (with additional reinforcements {{in the course}} direction) were obtained using a flat bed hand-knitting machine. The laminate fibre weight fractions ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 67 and their tensile and flexural properties were evaluated. Test results indicated that strengths {{higher than those of}} the woven fabric composites could be achieved in the course direction with unique failure modes occurring differently from those of the latter...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Six {{types of}} <b>weft</b> <b>rib</b> knit preforms {{developed}} {{on a flat}} bed hand knitting machine from E-glass rovings of 300 Tex {{have been used in}} this study. RTM laminates pre-pared from these six preforms were drop weight tested using a Dynatup CRC model with 830 - 1 data acquisition software. Glass/epoxy woven fabric composites with varied lay-up sequences were used for comparison and evaluation with these knit laminates under identi-cal test conditions. Laminates from knits 'with ' added reinforcements in the course direction have clearly exhibited characteristic failure modes and superior energy absorbing capabili-ties as compared to the corresponding woven counterparts...|$|E

40|$|So far the {{theoretical}} approach to weaving resistance and fabric geometry and the factors affecting {{it have been}} made for such weaves as plain, hop-sack and warp and <b>weft</b> faced <b>ribs.</b> In this work theoretical models were adopted to determine the fabric geometry and weaving resistance. Experimental and theoretical findings are in agreement. The trends of the effects on values of weaving resistance of such factors as warp elastic constant, weft tension, warp tension, the coefficient of friction of yarn against. yarn agree with the trends obtained by other workers by showing that weaving resistance increases with these factors. The results-also show that-the fabric geometry depends on warp and weft tension at-the moment of beat-up. Additionally, the change of fabric geometry across the fabric, the effect of two different let-off mechanisms,, Hattersley and WIRA/Poole, and the beaming CO processes on weaving resistance and fabric geometry were investigated. It {{was found that the}} fabric width-depends on the dynamics of fabric formation before and at the moment of beat-up. Wool Industries Research Associatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{electromagnetic}} shielding effectiveness (EMSE) of knitted fabrics made of copper, silver {{and stainless steel}} blended conductive yarns were analyzed statistically. Data obtained by the experiments carried out in 1. 7 - 2. 6 GHz frequency band {{with the help of}} waveguide system was evaluated by statistical methods. A total of 29 different knitted fabric samples were used in the experiments, including <b>rib,</b> <b>weft,</b> milano, lacoste and cardigan types. In order to test the stability of shielding effectiveness (SE) descriptive statistics were presented for all fabric samples. Subsequently, data was distributed into clusters by means of ANOVA method. In this way, the fabrics with the worst and best shielding performance were found at 95 % confidence level. The statistical findings overlapped with experimental results...|$|R
