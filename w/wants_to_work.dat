Looking Glass designer Constantine Hantzopoulos told the magazine that {{a modified version of}} the Flight Unlimited engine was being used to develop Flight Combat and Flight Unlimited II. Hantzopoulos commented that Flight Combat was [...] "the project everybody at Looking Glass <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on". The team expected to be finished with the game in roughly one year. By June 1997, GameSpot {{reported that}} Flight Unlimited II was running on the new ZOAR engine, coded from scratch by programmer James Fleming. In addition, the real-time CFDs model from Flight Unlimited had been discarded, as its programming was [...] "all black box spaghetti code from Seamus". GameSpot's T. Liam MacDonald noted that the Flight Unlimited II team expected soon to use the same engine for a combat flight simulator set in World War II. Computer Gaming World similarly reported that the company was [...] "definitely hot" [...] to develop Flight Combat, and that it might be created after Flight Unlimited II. Following that game's completion, the team could not decide between developing Flight Unlimited III or Flight Combat. As a result, they decided to develop them simultaneously, and Flight Combat began production in early 1998. Unlike all of the studio's other games, development of Flight Combat was funded through an insured bond, in an attempt to guarantee that the game would be finished. The company's Tim Stellmach later said that this setup was [...] "a real pain for [...] in some ways".|$|E
500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, something almost unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he wants people to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music he wants to make, while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired by everything when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn Off the TV ..."
