5|$|Section 3 {{provides}} {{that when the}} President transmits a <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, stating that {{he is unable to}} discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency, and until the President sends another <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> to the aforementioned officers declaring himself able to resume discharging those powers and duties, the Vice President discharges those powers and duties as Acting President.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 {{is meant}} to be invoked should the President's incapacitation prevent him from {{discharging}} his duties, but he is unable or unwilling to provide the <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> called for by Section 3. The President may resume exercising the Presidential duties by sending a <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.|$|E
5|$|However, the President may again {{submit a}} <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> of {{recovery}} to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. That declaration could be responded {{to by the}} Vice President {{and a majority of}} the Cabinet {{in the same way as}} stated earlier.

5|$|Royal assent is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> notifying parliament {{of his or her}} agreement to the bill.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the {{traditional}} ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long {{after it had}} been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived {{as part of a}} string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ {{the traditional}} ceremony where required.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the revolt, Zeno instituted a harsh {{persecution}} of pagan intellectuals. With the failure of the revolt of Leontius, some pagans became disillusioned and many became Christian, or simply pretended to, in order to avoid persecution.

25|$|Under Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the {{president}} may transfer {{the president}}ial powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting {{a statement to the}} Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> stating that resumption. This transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers appropriate; in 2002 and again in 2007, President George W. Bush briefly transferred presidential authority to Vice President Dick Cheney. In both cases, this was done to accommodate a medical procedure that required Bush to be sedated; both times, Bush returned to duty later the same day.|$|E

25|$|Under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, {{the vice}} president, in {{conjunction}} with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is unable to discharge the presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.|$|E

500|$|A poll of MEP in June 2007 by MEP Alexander Nuno Alvaro, a pro-Brussels campaigner, {{found that}} 89% wanted a single seat and that 81% {{preferred}} Brussels. However, despite polling all MEPs, only 39% {{responded to the}} questions. Alvaro stated that, after consulting polling firms, this was a high turnout for an opinion poll even if not totally representative. A Parliamentary magazine was pressured to drop the publication of this poll initially, reflecting the sensitive nature of the issue. In the same month, another survey by Simon Hix of the University of Manchester and Roger Scully from the University of Aberystwyth found a 68% support for a single seat. In their survey 272 of the 732 people questioned responded. Following each sitting in Strasbourg, hundreds of MEPs sign a petition calling for a reduction of time in Strasbourg, though Pascal Mangin, Strasboug's deputy mayor, does not believe {{the opinion of the}} MEPs to be important. Nevertheless, in January 2009 a Parliamentary <b>written</b> <b>declaration</b> calling for one Brussels seat failed to get sufficient support. It gained 286 signatures out of 393 needed for it to be considered. Brussels campaigners cited that it was bad timing, with French and German leaders of Parliament and the main two groups ordering their members not to support the motion. The campaigners vowed to continue the fight while the Mayor of Strasbourg Roland Ries this time welcomed the [...] "wisdom of the parliamentarians" [...] and said it signalled their desire for Strasbourg to host the institution alone.|$|E
