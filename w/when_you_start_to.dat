500|$|Seamus Blackley {{designed}} the game's physics system, {{which is a}} modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glass's flight simulator Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as [...] "far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game". The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The game's most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character's head [...] "tilts forward <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> run, and jerks back a bit when you stop", and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its [...] "head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [...] mass and velocity of the objects involved". On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, [...] "If games don't obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn't right", and that [...] "the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn't notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should".|$|E

And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And then you start hoping there is a God.

6000|$|After a fortnight's stay {{they were}} sent for to the colonel's quarters, where they found Madame Reynier and her child. [...] "I had a letter from my husband this morning," [...] she said, [...] "from his camp near Cordova, thanking you with all his heart for the inestimable service you {{rendered}} him, and begging {{me to tell you}} that you can count on his gratitude to the extent of his life at any and all times. You need no assurance of mine. And now about your journey. All is prepared for you to leave to-morrow morning. You are to come here to the colonel's quarters soon after daybreak. Here are your two disguises, for the one as a young bachelor of medicine, for the other as a young novice. Here is your pass, signed by the minister, authorizing you both to pass on to your relations at Ciudad Rodrigo, and to go unmolested thence where you choose, also recommending you to the care of all French and Spanish authorities. A regiment marches to-morrow morning for the frontier; the colonel is a cousin of my husband. I have told him that some friends of yours rendered me much kindness and service on my way down, and that I particularly commend you to his care. He has promised to allow you to follow the regiment, and to see that you get quarters at each halting-place. He does not know you for anything but what you appear to be. When you have put on these dresses to-morrow morning, step out by the private door from these quarters, looking carefully <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> see that there is no one in the street. Then go boldly to No. 15, Rue St. Geronimo; go into the courtyard, there you will see two stout mules with all necessaries, under charge of a soldier, who will have instructions to hand them over to you without asking any questions; then go down to the Retiro and wait till the 16th come along. The Colonel will be on the look-out for you, and you will ride up to him and hand him this note. And now farewell, dear boys; never shall I forget you, or cease to pray for you, and may be when this terrible war is over we may meet as friends again. Keep these little tokens of remembrance of your grateful friends." [...] So saying, Madame Reynier pressed into the boys' hands two magnificent gold watches and chains, held her child up for each of them to kiss, threw her arms round their necks and kissed them herself, and then drawing down her veil to conceal the tears which were standing in her eyes, left them hastily.|$|E

50|$|The disease overwinters as {{sclerotia}} or as mycelium on dead plant tissue. Once {{spring to}} early summer arrives, germination phase with hyphae growth continues. Following this, root colonization occurs. In Mid and late summer {{you begin to}} see the disease at its infectious stage, which is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> observe associated symptoms. The pathogen will penetrate the host, and colonize plant root tissue causing root rot. This initially causes the first symptoms of chlorotic leaves and eventually wilting. The pathogen will then eventually disseminate infecting neighboring plants, with infected plant tissue serving as a secondary inoculum fueling the disease. In situation of high moisture, conidia are produced on spore mats but its role in dispersal is currently unknown since very rarely conidia were found to germinate and facilitate the spread of disease.|$|E

5000|$|... 3DFINS feature Golf Ball Dimpled {{technology}} [...] 3DFINS Dimple {{technology is}} based on the Golfball dimples. A surfboard fin with dimples creates a turbulent flow a fin without Dimples is more a lamina flow. Turbulent flow has more adhesion so <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> turn, the dimpled fin surface delays the flow separation, reducing cavitation's (the separation bubble) allowing the foil to maintain performance. When the surfer is turning at high speeds, the turbulent boundary layer helps the flow overcome an adverse pressure gradient and allows the fin to remain attached to the surface longer than it would otherwise. This reduces drag, increases lift and improves overall performance of the fin design. a World Tour Proven Innovation that has set the path for 3DFINS as an innovator of Fins. The Dimples are unique to 3DFINS TM (Design Patented, Aust, USA, International Patents Pending). Designed by Australian Surfer/inventor Courtney Potter while working closely with Josh Kerr, Jamie O'Brien and Christian Fletcher and a comprehensive series of Fluid Dynamic testing, the results have continued to astound. The testimonials from pro’s and average Joe’s prove it - Dimples make a difference.|$|E
