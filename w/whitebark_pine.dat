5|$|<b>Whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and <b>Whitebark</b> <b>Pine,</b> are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{estimated}} that beetles had killed <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines</b> across 500000 acre in the West, while in 2009, beetles were {{estimated to have}} killed trees on 800000 acre, the most since record-keeping began. The pine beetle upsurge has killed nearly 750,000 <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines</b> in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem alone.|$|R
5000|$|The botanical {{diversity}} of the Trinity Alps is quite unique. The region has intrigued botanists for many years because of the predominance of the Sierran flora only 60 mi from the Pacific Ocean. Conifers common in the Sierra Nevada such as foxtail pines, lodgepole pines, western white <b>pines,</b> <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines,</b> ponderosa pines, red firs, and white firs are also common in the Alps alongside the endemic Brewer spruce. [...] Large wildfires swept through the western forests in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Upper montane and subalpine {{forests are}} made up of red fir, {{mountain}} hemlock, western white pine, lodgepole pine; and at the highest elevations, foxtail and <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines.</b> Montane meadows and streamsides in the Klamath Ranges are marked by an abundance of California pitcherplant, western azalea, and occasional Port-Orford-cedar, which is disjunct here from its coastal populations.|$|R
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
50|$|Mountain hemlock {{is adapted}} to sites with {{long-lasting}} snowpacks. In the spring, mountain hemlocks emerging through 2 to 4 m of snow were transpiring, whereas nearby <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines</b> did not transpire until the soil beneath them was free of snow. Mountain hemlock is well adapted to cope with heavy snow and ice loads, with tough branches and the drooping branchlets shedding snow readily.|$|R
50|$|There is {{currently}} {{no way to}} stop the spread and effects of blister rust. However, a small number of trees (fewer than 5%) in most populations harbor genetic resistance to blister rust. There have been some restoration efforts by the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service in the northern Rocky Mountains. Restoration efforts involve harvesting cones from potentially and known resistant <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines,</b> growing seedlings, and outplanting seedlings in suitable sites.|$|R
40|$|Growth habit, occurrence, and use. The genus Pinus {{comprises}} about 100 {{species and}} numerous varieties and hybrids. It {{is one of}} the largest of the conifer genera, and one of the most important and widely distributed genera of forest trees in the Northern Hemisphere. Globally, the genus spans latitudes from Alaska to Nicaragua, Scandinavia to North Africa, and Siberia to Sumatra and inhabits a diversity of sites at altitudes ranging from sea level to timberline (Critchfield and Little 1966). Various pines exemplify the extremes of coastal and subalpine habitats in different regions of the world, including shore and <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines</b> in western North America; Italian stone and Swiss stone pine...|$|R
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, <b>Whitebark</b> <b>Pine,</b> and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} <b>whitebark</b> <b>pines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The John Muir Wilderness {{contains}} the largest contiguous area above 10000 ft {{in the continental}} United States. It contains large areas of subalpine meadows and fellfields above 10800 ft, containing stands of <b>whitebark</b> and foxtail <b>pine.</b> From 9000 ft to 10800 ft, the wilderness is dominated by lodgepole pines. Below the lodgepole forest is forest dominated by Jeffrey pine.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., EPI {{students}} {{have contributed to}} projects that protect the wildlife and habitat of Montana’s Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem - from grizzly bear and lynx to <b>whitebark</b> and bristlecone <b>pines,</b> to the current projects involving bison, cougar, and moose. Students become aware of and informed about their surroundings and learn about interactions between humans and wildlife, all while contributing to on-the-ground projects that directly improve local conservation efforts and inform land management decisions.|$|R
25|$|Subalpine areas {{include the}} upper limit {{for the growth of}} {{standing}} trees. From 8,000 feet to treeline, plants are fewer in overall number with exposed patches of bare ground providing a harsh environment. Rock spirea, lupin, Indian paintbrush, and penstemon {{are a few of the}} rugged members of this community. Trees in this community include <b>Whitebark</b> <b>Pine</b> and Mountain Hemlock.|$|E
25|$|Land cover {{types in}} the Sawtooth Wilderness include pine and spruce-fir forests, meadows, and alpine tundra. Lodgepole pine forms nearly {{monotypic}} forests in lower elevations of the wilderness, while douglas fir and quaking aspen can also be found. Higher elevations contain <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine. There are no known threatened or endangered plant species in the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{communities}} {{range from}} low-elevation grasslands and ponderosa pine forest to alpine meadows. Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, subalpine fir and <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> {{can be found}} in the higher elevations, with Douglas-fir, white fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine elsewhere. Wildflowers include clarkia, Indian paintbrush, sego lily, elephanthead, larkspur, shooting star, and bluebell. Rocky bluffs in the Hells Canyon area support prickly pear cactus and poison ivy.|$|E
50|$|The eastern Great Basin is wetter {{than the}} western part in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada range. Moisture {{collected}} by this high range promoted the heavy Pleistocene glaciation and still supports {{a wide variety of}} flora and fauna. Lower elevations are covered by aspen trees, while higher up the <b>whitebark</b> and limber <b>pines</b> predominate. Mountain goats, bighorn sheep, mule deer, mountain lions, marmots, beaver, and pikas are common residents. A population of Himalayan snowcock was introduced from Pakistan, and is thriving among the high cliffs. Streams, particularly on the western slopes have populations of native Lahontan or Humboldt cutthroat trout, but many of these populations are hybridized with rainbow trout or have been displaced by brown and brook trout, all stocked for angling purposes before impacts on native trout species were well understood.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, Clunie {{received}} {{a commission to}} paint Lake George above Mammoth Lakes area and invited Richard to accompany him and experiment with painting in the open, in [...] "plein-air." [...] Richard began painting. Clunie told him that a fledgling artist should never release any of his early works {{for at least one}} year [...] "lest they come back to haunt you." [...] Richard heeded Clunie’s advice and destroyed approximately fifty of his early paintings. With wry humor he mused, “They do make a nice fire." [...] That same year, the USFS, told Clunie that he had to dismantle his 'permanent summer camp' that he'd made for years, between Fourth and Fifth Lakes in the Palisades. Richard and Kent helped remove more than 30 years of accumulated possessions stored at the camp each season. Because of Clunie’s lengthy career in the high country and the extensive collection of art that it inspired, Richard was obsessed with similar high mountain scenes, “where you find the granite peaks with snow and glaciers, <b>whitebark</b> and lodgepole <b>pines</b> and the wonderful north face snowfields, the places you had to hike to—not the ones {{at the end of the}} road.” ...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{pine beetle}} (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is an {{important}} disturbance agent in Pinus ecosystems of western North America, historically causing significant tree mortality. Most recorded outbreaks have occurred in mid elevation lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). In warm years, tree mortality also occurs at higher elevations in mixed species stands. Mountain pine beetle's relative preference for and performance in Pinus species that either commonly or less frequently encounter this insect has received little direct testing. Further, knowledge of the relative proportions of secondary compounds, which can differ among Pinus species and play important roles in attack rates and outcomes, is important to understanding host suitability. We monitored mountain pine beetle attacks, adult emergence timing and reproductive capacity in lodgepole and <b>whitebark</b> (Pinus albicaulis) <b>pines</b> growing in mixed stands at relatively high elevation. Phloem monoterpene chemistry of trees prior to and during attack was compared within and between species. Although beetles attacked lodgepole pine more frequently, lodgepole pines also resisted attacks more frequently. Overall, there were equal numbers of lethal attacks between species. Brood production and adult emergence timing did not differ between tree species. The relative composition of secondary compounds differed by tree species, although both species contained compounds that affect mountain pine beetle attack and reproductive success.

25|$|The Winds {{are known}} to have a small grizzly bear population, {{primarily}} in the northernmost areas. Other mammals include the black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and wolverine. Bald eagles, falcons and hawks {{are just a few of}} the 300 species of birds known to inhabit the region. The streams and lakes are home to Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brook, brown, lake, and golden trout—about 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer named Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce.|$|E
25|$|The USGS defines ten forested {{zones in}} the Rocky Mountains. Zones in more southern, warmer, or drier areas {{are defined by}} the {{presence}} of pinyon pines/junipers, ponderosa pines, or oaks mixed with pines. In more northern, colder, or wetter areas, zones are defined by Douglas-firs, Cascadian species (such as western hemlock), lodgepole pines/quaking aspens, or firs mixed with spruce. Near treeline, zones can consist of white pines (such as <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> or bristlecone pine); or a mixture of white pine, fir, and spruce that appear as shrub-like krummholz. Finally, rivers and canyons can create a unique forest zone in more arid parts of the mountain range.|$|E
40|$|Six of nine five-needle {{white pine}} species {{native to the}} U. S. are found in California, {{and all of these}} are {{susceptible}} to the exotic pathogen, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). Since entering California, the rust has spread south over the geographic range of sugar pine, but until recently little was known about its impact on the higher elevation pines. From 1995 to 1999, a survey of five species in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks revealed rust in plots of sugar and western white pine only. In 2004 - 2005 a survey of the high elevation species over their California ranges revealed rust in plots of western white <b>pine,</b> <b>whitebark,</b> and the northern foxtail populations, but not in limber, southern foxtail, or Great Basin bristlecone pines. Mean incidence of rust across all plots was relatively low (12 to 15 %), but variation among plots was high (0 to 92 %). Rust was observed in a plot at 3400 m elevation in the southern Sierra. Other stress factors such as mountain pine beetle, fire exclusion and climate change are discussed in relation to their impacts on these pines. Practical issues for future management of these high-elevation pines and their ecosystems are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Voices in the Wind is {{a diverse}} {{collection}} of personal essays, anecdotes, profiles, and journalism contributed {{by some of}} the participants in the three Waterton-Glacier International Writers 2 ̆ 7 Conferences held in 1995, 1997, and 1999. Offering three days of writing, editing, and publishing workshops, the conference also includes field trips with local experts and encourages participants to write and publish articles about issues relating to the ecology of the region. Voices in the Wind collects some of these articles by both Canadian and American conferees. Several are full-time journalists, editors, or photographers, but the majority work as biologists, wildlife technicians, range ecologists, agrologists, hydrologists, and nurses, writing when they can. The anthology covers the geographical territory of the southwestern Alberta and north central Montana prairies, the region immediately surrounding the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, and the area 2 ̆ 7 s parks themselves. Its seven sections deal with some of the region 2 ̆ 7 s notable places and inhabitants, its hiking trails and mountain and montane ecosystems, bears, living in nature, and ethics. Several essays in the first two sections describe places striking for their intersection of human and natural history, like the Bar U Ranch, Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, and the 1995 flood in Pincher Creek, while others memorialize intriguing individuals- people like Montana 2 ̆ 7 s Mary Ground (1882 - 1990), a. k. a. Grass Woman, whose life spanned the traditional nomadic Blackfoot way of making a living, the transitional period when Indians were forced to abandon their traditional economy, up to the end of the twentieth century, as well as the renegade Glacier park warden and poacher Joe Cosley and the story of his dangerous capture. Hikers may zero in on the third and fourth sections, which recount hikes along the area 2 ̆ 7 s trails. Connoisseurs of nature writing will savor the essay by master storyteller and writer Andy Russell, who sets his account of a hike to the summit of Goat Ridge in the context of geological prehistory. Kevin Van Tighem 2 ̆ 7 s well-crafted prose never fails to enlighten, and his two essays on <b>whitebark</b> and limber <b>pines</b> and on the ranches adjacent to Waterton Park are no exception. Van Tighem quotes Nature Conservancy of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s western field director Larry Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s statement that if the biological diversity of ranch country is lost through real estate speculation, the 2 ̆ 2 cultural heritage and natural heritage of western North America could potentially undergo a transformation in the next twenty years that will be as profound and long reaching as the loss of the buffalo. Different yes: but no less significant. 2 ̆ 2 Hard-hitting and visionary journalist Andrew Nikiforuk 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Our Home and Native Land 2 ̆ 2 contains the sobering information that 2 ̆ 2 Road densities in the boreal [forest of Alberta] are now eight times higher than that recommended by the U. S. Forest Service to conserve big game animals such as grizzlies [...] In fact, only five percent of Alberta 2 ̆ 7 s forests now stand in blocks greater than nine square kilometres. A nine square kilometre block fits nicely into downtown Calgary and takes up no more than one-tenth the size of the city. Like Brazil, Alberta has eaten its wilderness capital with gusto. 2 ̆ 2 As someone who struggled and failed for four years to live in a part of Canada where a 2 ̆ 2 hike 2 ̆ 2 lasted only about twenty minutes before one emerged on the other side of a block this size, I shuddered reading this statistic. John Russell 2 ̆ 7 s story of 2 ̆ 2 Encounters with Bears 2 ̆ 2 on and near his land just north of Waterton may alter readers 2 ̆ 7 views of these mammals, particularly his surprising description of two bears, a black and a grizzly, wrestling, feeding, and ambling about the country together as if starring in a buddy movie...|$|R
25|$|In {{the high}} alpine country, plant {{communities}} are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of foxtail pine and stunted <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine.</b> Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes {{are home to}} small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray-crowned rosy finches and American pipits, and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands. Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone {{in search of food}} (a behavior now exacerbated by improper disposal of waste by campers), but do not winter there.|$|E
25|$|Among {{native plants}} of the GYE, <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus albicaulis) is {{a species of}} special interest, {{in large part because}} of its {{seasonal}} importance to grizzly bears, but also because its distribution could be dramatically reduced by relatively minor global warming. In this case, researchers do not have a good long-term data set on the species, but they understand its ecology well enough to project declining future conservation status. A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced fungal rust disease, White Pine Blister Rust (Cronartium ribicola), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.|$|E
25|$|Pines grow well in acid soils, {{some also}} on {{calcareous}} soils; most require good soil drainage, preferring sandy soils, {{but a few}} (e.g. lodgepole pine) will tolerate poorly drained wet soils. A few are able to sprout after forest fires (e.g. Canary Island pine). Some species of pines (e.g. bishop pine) need fire to regenerate, and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimes. Several species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude (e.g. Siberian dwarf pine, mountain pine, <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> and the bristlecone pines). The pinyon pines {{and a number of}} others, notably Turkish pine and gray pine, are particularly well adapted to growth in hot, dry semi-desert climates.|$|E
25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in {{foraging}} activity, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
500|$|While {{the flora}} of Grand Teton National Park is {{generally}} healthy, the <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> {{and to a}} lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine,</b> an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above [...] and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the [...] grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species {{is considered to be a}} keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its [...] "ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance" [...] and foundation in that it has a paramount role that [...] "defines ecosystem structure, function, and process". <b>Whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital <b>whitebark</b> <b>pine</b> trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.|$|E
