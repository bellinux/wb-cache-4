5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can}} be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E
5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused {{significant}} damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, {{and at one}} point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|Amidst {{his years}} of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by {{training}} hard in the dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd dan black belt in Kyokushin in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization) when he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982. In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney. During his time in Sydney, he earned {{a living as a}} bouncer in a nightclub in the renowned King's Cross area.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the free}} {{population}} 23.4% {{of males and}} 13.4% of females were considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total population. Figures for the population by age showed 24.6% were children younger than 10 years old; 21.1% were adolescents and young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population. The second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months old. Its {{results showed that the}} population had grown to 14,333,915 inhabitants since the 1872 census.|$|E

5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under his control as the king <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E
5|$|At a Creation Convention in San Francisco, Adams {{received}} career {{advice from}} Steve Leialoha and Chris Claremont, and also met another aspiring illustrator, Mike Mignola, with whom Adams became friends, and later, business partners. Because of {{the popularity of}} the X-Men, Adams included a Wolverine story in his portfolio, although he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> casual fan of the X-Men himself. He would later become closely associated with the X-Men in his early career. After showing his portfolio to editor Bob Schreck at a Creation Convention, he gained permission to set up a table, doing drawings for fans for $5 – $10. He began submitting samples to Marvel Comics when he was 18, taking a job at a pizzeria after graduating high school.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, {{but he did not}} find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

5|$|By September25, Georges {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around {{the center of}} circulation. By September27, Georges reached an intensity of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E

5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, and <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> pawn for a varied collection of different elites {{to improve their}} political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
