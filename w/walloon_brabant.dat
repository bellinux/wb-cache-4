25|$|Around {{the year}} 1000, the County of Brussels {{became a part}} of the Duchy of Brabant (and {{therefore}} of the Holy Roman Empire) with Brussels as one of the four capitals of the Duchy, along with Leuven, Antwerp, and 's-Hertogenbosch. Dutch was the sole language of Brussels, {{as was the case in}} the other three cities. Not all of Brabant, however, was Dutch-speaking. The area south of Brussels, around the town of Nivelles, was a French-speaking area roughly corresponding to the modern province of <b>Walloon</b> <b>Brabant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brabantian {{is named}} after the {{historical}} Duchy of Brabant, which corresponded mainly to the provinces of North Brabant and southern Gelderland, the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Flemish Brabant, as well as Brussels (where its native speakers have become a minority) and the province of <b>Walloon</b> <b>Brabant.</b> Brabantian expands into small parts in the west of Limburg while its strong influence on the East Flemish of East Flanders and eastern Zeelandic Flanders weakens towards the west. In a small area in the northwest of North Brabant (Willemstad), Hollandic is spoken. Conventionally, the South Guelderish dialects are distinguished from Brabantian, {{but there are no}} objective criteria apart from geography to do so. Over 5 million people live in an area with some form of Brabantian being the predominant colloquial language out of the area's 22 million Dutch-speakers.|$|E
50|$|The Tielt Formation (Formatie van Tielt; Formation de Tielt; abbreviation: Tt; {{named after}} the town of Tielt in West-Flanders) is a {{geologic}} formation in the subsurface of Belgium. The formation crops out {{in the north of}} Hainaut, in the southern and central parts of West- and East-Flanders and in <b>Walloon</b> and Flemish <b>Brabant.</b> It consists of marine very fine sand and silt, deposited in the shallow sea that covered Belgium during the middle and late Ypresian age (early Eocene, about 50 million years ago).|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} this uncompromising {{attitude}} at the time, {{it was decided that}} the entire area should someday be assimilated into the Third Reich and divided into three new Reichsgaue of a Greater Germanic Reich: Flandern and Brabant for the Flemish territories, and Wallonien for the <b>Walloon</b> parts. Reichsgau <b>Brabant</b> was to be headed by Gauleiter U. van Brusselen. On 12 July 1944, a Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich was established to accomplish precisely this goal, derived from the previous military administration. This step was curiously only taken {{at the very end of}} World War II, when Germany's armies were already in full retreat. The new government was already ousted by the Allied advances in Western Europe in September 1944, and the authority of the Belgian government-in-exile was restored. The actual incorporation into the Nazi state of these new provinces therefore only occurred de jure and with its leaders already in exile in Germany. The only place where any notable gain was made in re-establishing Reich authority occurred in parts of southern Wallonia during the Ardennes Campaign. The collaborators merely achieved a Pyrrhic victory since when the Allied tanks had rolled into Belgium several months before this already signalled the end of their personal domains in the Reich. Many of their supporters fled to Germany where they were conscripted into the Waffen-SS to participate in the final military campaigns of the Third Reich.|$|R
40|$|Using X-ray microtomography, 3 D soil {{structure}} can be visualised and analysed through useful factors like pore size distribution, shape, connectivity, orientation, etc. X-ray scans yield grey-level 2 D images, {{which can be}} recombined to form 3 D structures. Treatments of the grey-level images can consist of either a binarization -distinguishing soil and pores- or a permeability level attribution directly linked to the grey-level values. The latter leads to problems in order to assign a permeability for each point (in soil a same grey level value can be assigned to points with a different permeability), {{as well as to}} analyse the 3 D structure. On the other hand, treatment of black and white 3 D structures is well-handled. However, the impact of the choice of one thresholding technique on the resulting images has already been demonstrated. Moreover, thresholding methods are various and numerous. Many of them are based on the image histogram analysis. But because of the soil complexity, the relevance of these techniques becomes debatable, with a risk of producing non reliable images. We propose to palliate this with a simple new algorithm based on physical measurements: it uses a loop fixing the threshold value in order to match the measured porosity for each sample. In this communication, our point is to highlight the impact of different thresholding techniques on the analysis and interpretation of our soil microtomograms. The underlying questions could be: Does the thresholding method influence our conclusions? Are the results depending on the sample itself or on the methodology? In order to answer these questions we tested the Otsu technique and our physically based algorithm. Soils samples were removed from the upper layer (Ap horizon) of a silty soil (Gentinnes, <b>Brabant</b> <b>Walloon,</b> Belgium) in plots with different management practices. In fact, since 2004, the field has been cultivated in conventional tillage (CT) or reduced tillage (RT). In order to empty the meso- and macroporosity, samples were placed under a 1. 5 MPa pressure (Richards apparatus). Samples were then scanned by X-ray microtomography using a Skyscan- 1172 high-resolution desktop micro-CT system (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). The cone beam source operated at 100 kV, using an aluminium filter. The detector configuration, i. e. 1048 x 2000 pixels with a 16 -bit X-ray camera, and the distance source-object-camera were adjusted to produce images with a pixel size of 17 µm. Porosity was measured for each scanned sample. Then the threshold methods -the Otsu technique on one hand and our developed algorithm on the other - were applied, and morphological factors were calculated for both methods. A comparison of the first results shows a threshold influence on average porosity and number of pores, but also on connectivity factors and size distribution. The apparent porosity of the images, as well as connectivity, is underestimated with the Otsu technique. Despite the fact that the changes induced by thresholding are more important for RT than CT, global conclusions about the comparison of these agricultural practices are approximately the same in this case. However, differences between tillage systems are less important with the Otsu method, confirming the impact of choosing the adapted threshold method. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|The fourth state reform, {{which took}} place in 1993 under Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, {{consolidated}} the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the Belgian Constitution was amended to read as follows, “Belgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions”. During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and <b>Walloon</b> <b>Brabant,</b> and the reformation of the Federal Parliament's bicameral system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Brussels ( [...] , , [...] ), officially the Brussels-Capital Region ( [...] , [...] ), is {{a region}} of Belgium {{comprising}} 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the de jure capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region {{is located in the}} central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. Compared to most regions in Europe, Brussels has a relatively small territory, with an area of 161km2 (62.31 sq mi). The region has a population of 1.2million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 2.1million, the largest agglomeration in Belgium. Brussels is also part of a large conurbation which extends between Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Leuven and <b>Walloon</b> <b>Brabant</b> and is home to over 5 million people.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the north}} of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is {{characterized}} by intensive agriculture. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: <b>Walloon</b> <b>Brabant</b> around Nivelles, [...] Western Hainaut ( [...] , around Tournai), and Hesbaye around Waremme. [...] South of the sillon industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more extensive farming. It is traditionally divided into the regions of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne, the Ardennes and Land of Herve, as well as the Belgian Lorraine around Arlon and Virton. Dividing it into Condroz, Famenne, Calestienne, Ardennes (including Thiérache), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the Gaume) is more reflective of the physical geography. [...] The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges. [...] It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the Eifel in Germany via the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277ft).|$|E
