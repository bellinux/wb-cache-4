50|$|Looking back {{five years}} after the bill was passed, the Consumers Union {{reported}} that <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> competition, the reason that sold the bill, had not succeeded as legislators had hoped.

25|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{consisted of}} six remote-controlled retractable gun turrets, and fixed tail and nose turrets. Each turret was fitted with two 20mm cannons, {{for a total}} of 16. Recoil vibration from gunnery practice often caused the aircraft's electrical <b>wiring</b> <b>to</b> jar loose or the vacuum tube electronics to malfunction, leading to failure of the aircraft controls and navigation equipment; this contributed to the crash of B-36B 44-92035 on 22 November 1950.|$|E

25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the <b>wiring</b> <b>to</b> the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E

Only one of the two engine rooms and one boiler room were flooded. <b>Wiring</b> <b>to</b> the main and secondary gun batteries was severed, but prompt action by damage control brought the forward diesel generator up within minutes, making power available to all gun mounts, for fire fighting and counter-flooding. With attacking planes flying overhead, the crew began to break out the service ammunition, and by 0801 hours the ship began to fight back by sending up anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead <b>wiring)</b> <b>to</b> make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E

500|$|While Rand {{was working}} as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by <b>wiring</b> <b>to</b> the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for you, then I am not the editor for you." [...] His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.|$|E
500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary <b>wiring</b> <b>to</b> control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E

500|$|The <b>wiring</b> <b>to</b> the {{subscriber}} in telephone networks {{is generally}} done in twisted pair cable. [...] Its impedance at audio frequencies, and {{especially at the}} more restricted telephone band frequencies, is far from constant. [...] It is possible to manufacture this kind of cable to have a 600 Ω characteristic impedance but it will only be this value at one specific frequency. [...] This might be quoted as a nominal 600 Ω impedance at 800Hz or 1kHz. [...] Below this frequency the characteristic impedance rapidly rises and {{becomes more and more}} dominated by the ohmic resistance of the cable as the frequency falls. [...] At the bottom of the audio band the impedance can be several tens of kilohms. [...] On the other hand, at high frequency in the MHz region, the characteristic impedance flattens out to something almost constant. [...] The reason for this response is explained at primary line constants.|$|E

The event also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb. Pennsylvania steam locomotive 1361 was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June8, 1957. It is one of 425 K4s-class engines, the principal passenger locomotives on the Pennsylvania Railroad that regularly plied the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places [...] and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966. The operation of the observation park {{was transferred to the}} city of Altoona the same year. The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the New York Central Railroad in 1968. The merger created Penn Central, which went bankrupt and was taken over by the federal government in 1976, as part of the merger that created Conrail. The second track from the inside at the Horseshoe Curve was removed by Conrail in 1981. The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September1985 and was replaced with the ex-Conrail EMD GP9 diesel-electric locomotive 7048 that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme.|$|E
