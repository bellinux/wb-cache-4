25|$|Because of {{intervention}} by Kahlo and Rivera, Russian Leon Trotsky obtained asylum in Mexico. Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, were first housed in La Casa Azul starting in January 1937. The windows facing the street were closed in with adobe bricks for Trotsky’s safety {{as he was}} under a death sentence from Stalin. A high wall was built between this house and the adjoining one as well. From January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky lived and <b>worked</b> <b>here,</b> writing treatises such as Su moral y la nuestra and his regular political articles. This would often cause security problems in the area, due to the hostility of Trotsky's political enemies. During all of this time, the house {{continued to be a}} meeting place for intellectuals, especially those associated with Communism. In April 1939, Trotsky and Sedova left the Blue House after Trotsky had a falling out with Rivera over ideology and Rivera’s criticism of Trotsky’s writings, moving to a nearby house on Viena Street.|$|E
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it <b>worked</b> <b>here</b> because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E
