25|$|In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis {{in which}} he argued that Genesis should be {{interpreted}} as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.|$|E

500|$|Galileo {{was one of}} {{the first}} modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In The Assayer, he wrote [...] "Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe... It is written in the {{language}} of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;...." [...] His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy. His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason said Chris was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was saying these things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> your ideas.|$|E

500|$|While some critics, such as writer Christopher Hitchens, {{psychologist}} Steven Pinker and Nobel laureates Sir Harold Kroto, James D. Watson and Steven Weinberg have defended Dawkins's {{stance on}} religion and praised his work, others, including Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, astrophysicist Martin Rees, philosopher of science Michael Ruse, literary critic Terry Eagleton, and theologian Alister McGrath, have criticised Dawkins on various grounds, including the assertion that his work simply serves as an atheist counterpart to religious fundamentalism rather than a productive critique of it, {{and that he has}} fundamentally misapprehended the foundations of the theological positions he claims to refute. Rees and Higgs, in particular, have both rejected Dawkins's confrontational stance towards religion as narrow and [...] "embarrassing", with Higgs going as far as to equate Dawkins with the religious fundamentalists he criticises. Atheist philosopher John Gray has denounced Dawkins as an [...] "anti-religious missionary" [...] whose assertions are [...] "in no sense novel or original," [...] suggesting that, [...] "transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind, Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings." [...] Gray has also criticised Dawkins's perceived allegiance to Darwin, stating that if [...] "science, for Darwin, was a method of inquiry that enabled him to edge tentatively and humbly toward the truth, for Dawkins, science is an unquestioned view of the world."

The show was featured on the February 11 cover of Entertainment Weekly, where it was called [...] "the smartest comedy on TV" [...] and which included the article [...] "The 101 Reasons We Love Parks and Recreation". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it [...] "a fabulous season – the best thing on TV in 2011 so far". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad called {{it one of the}} ten best shows of 2011, and said the season saw major growth of both its major characters, especially Leslie Knope, along with the expansion of a strong cast of secondary and tertiary characters as well. New York magazine writer Willa Paskin praised the show for comedy grounded in optimism and characters who genuinely like each other, rather than the cynical humor more prevalent in other comedy shows of the time. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it a [...] "remarkable season of TV comedy" [...] without a single bad episode. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said although he considered Parks and Recreation the funniest sitcom on television during its second season, [...] "it somehow got even better" [...] during the third. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said during the third season, Parks and Recreation was [...] "the funniest, sweetest, most consistent sitcom on television", and that the way the characters were seeking new opportunities outside the parks department {{by the end of the}} season demonstrates the show is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and is [...] "not content to simply spin its wheels". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said he believed that the third season [...] "will become to be recognized as one of the best seasons of any sitcom ever", and that the characters and setting of Pawnee were so fully developed that he felt a close, personal connection to them. Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "a near-flawless season".|$|E
2500|$|Similar to {{the number}} of viewers present, {{collectivism}} versus individualism can influence impression formation. Collectivists are at ease as long as their impressions are largely in alignment with the larger group's impressions. When a collectivist wants to change his/her impression, he/she may be compelled to change the views of all group members. [...] However, this could be challenging for collectivists, who tend to be less confrontational than individualists.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{exhibition}} Korsvägar at the Museum of World Culture and with a visitor-perspective see how the theme and objects of the exhibition take form for the visitors.

My research questions explore how the exhibition is presented, what relation the visitors have with the exhibition and objects and also if they have a <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their lives after experiencing the exhibition. To answer my research questions I have analyzed the texts in the exhibition and interviewed visitors after they have experienced the exhibition. From the interviews and the theoretical perspective of cultural studies professor Tony Bennett, I found that the presentation of objects and texts have a big impact on visitors’ experience. The visitors conform to the museum’s facts, but they do not necessarily have a <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their lives accordingly to what the exhibition’s agenda might say...|$|R

[...] "This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians." [...] Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when it is happening on various shows, the viewer is [...] "left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)" [...] and that All My Children [...] "fed right into" [...] this with the Reese and Bianca storyline.|$|E
2500|$|North Africa, {{comprising}} north Tunisia {{and eastern}} Algeria in the Vandal period, became a Roman province again, {{from which the}} Vandals were expelled. Many Vandals went to Saldae (today called Béjaïa in north Algeria) where they integrated themselves with the Berbers. Many others were put into imperial service or fled to the two Gothic kingdoms (Ostrogothic Kingdom and Visigothic Kingdom). [...] Some Vandal women married Byzantine soldiers and settled in north Algeria and Tunisia. The choicest Vandal warriors were formed into five cavalry regiments, known as Vandali Iustiniani, stationed on the Persian frontier. Some entered the private service of Belisarius. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia states that [...] "Gelimer was honourably treated and received large estates in Galatia. He was also offered the rank of a patrician but had to refuse {{it because he was}} not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his Arian faith". In the words of historian Roger Collins: [...] "The remaining Vandals were then shipped back to Constantinople to be absorbed into the imperial army. As a distinct ethnic unit they disappeared".

2500|$|Burr is a {{lead role}} in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton, which was written by playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and {{inspired}} by historian Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of Hamilton. The role of Burr was originated by Leslie Odom, Jr., who won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical {{for his work in}} the role. In Hamilton, Burr is both the main narrator of events as well as a sympathetic yet growing antagonist to Hamilton. He is portrayed as ambitious but indecisive, liking to smile and gladhand rather than make any strong commitment or action—something Hamilton constantly questions and calls him out on. Burr's prominent songs include [...] "Wait For It", which explains his willingness to wait for fate to decide his place and what he deserves, and [...] "The Room Where It Happens", which demonstrates his desire for more influence in decision making when he realizes waiting is not getting him where he wants to be. This puts him increasingly at odds with Hamilton, who views Burr as lacking morals or ideals and being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> positions for small gain. During the final duel, Burr is shown to have regret and sorrow for the duel and his role in Hamilton's death and his eventual villainous slant in history, rather than the more callous and dismissive regards records tend to show.|$|E

In the book, Santorum also compared pro-choice Americans to [...] "German Nazis." [...] John Brabender, an adviser to Santorum's Senate and Presidential races, reflected back on the book's controversies and said Santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage, and Santorum was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> much of it simply to gain moderate supporters. [...] In addition, a past article Santorum wrote to The Catholic Online resurfaced in 2005, in which he linked liberalism and moral relativism in American society, particularly within seminaries, to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. He wrote, [...] "... {{it is no surprise that}} Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm." [...] His remarks were heavily criticized, especially in Massachusetts, and he was asked for an explanation. Santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was [...] "no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston." [...] In addition, the question of Santorum's association with the K Street Project was an issue that his opponent made use of during the campaign.|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{incident}} {{occurred in the}} Second Test, though {{it might not have}} been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, but if he had he been given out he would have made only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman {{that it was not a}} clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote [...] "I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper scooped up the ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley".
