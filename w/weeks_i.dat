Stahlschmidt's death only 24 hours {{after the death of}} 1./JG27 ace Günter Steinhausen and was {{followed}} on 30 September 1942 by the death of Hans-Joachim Marseille. I./JG27 claimed 588 aircraft shot down in April 1941–November 1942. Stahlschmidt, Steinhausen and Marseille between them accounted for 250 of these; 42% of the unit's total. Morale fell so low that the Gruppe was withdrawn to Sicily in October. It returned briefly to North Africa but was withdrawn from the theatre for the final time on 6 December 1942.|$|E

500|$|With wind gusts {{reaching}} , coach Bill Parcells {{chose to}} take the wind when his team won the opening coin toss of the Giants' NFC Championship Game against the Washington Redskins. With the wind at their backs the Giants scored 10 first quarter points while the Redskins managed only two first downs. The Redskins were forced to punt {{three times in the}} quarter, and the wind limited those punts to 23, 27, and 24 yards. The Redskins launched a drive behind Jay Schroeder's 48-yard completion to wide receiver Art Monk in the second quarter. However, after the Redskins botched the field goal snap on a 51-yard field goal attempt, the Giants drove for a touchdown with the wind in their face to make the score 17–0 at halftime. The Giants defense dominated the second half, and both teams went scoreless to make the final score 17–0. Schroeder completed only 20 of 50 passes for a meager 3.8yards per attempt. Keys to the victory were tackle Brad Benson's neutralizing of Redskins pass rusher Dexter Manley, who had 18.5 sacks on the season, and the team's defense. After the game, John Madden remarked: [...] "Last year, I thought the Bears had the best defense I had ever seen. But in the last two <b>weeks,</b> <b>I</b> feel these Giants have as good a defense as has ever played in this league." ...|$|E

500|$|Wright scored his 27th {{goal of the}} season, away at Chelsea in {{the first}} week of April; it took him seven goals short of {{breaking}} Cliff Bastin's career record at Arsenal. A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically you would like to be in their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many <b>weeks</b> <b>I</b> have thought that was the best we could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, {{the fear}} of war between the Soviets and the West reached a high point after the coup. On 5 March, General Lucius D.

General Omar Bradley later wrote that when he read Clay's [...] "lugubrious assessment" [...] in Washington he was [...] "lifted right out of [...] chair", and George F.
