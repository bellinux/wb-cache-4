5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a {{drawn-out}} bidding process, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were warming and the country's economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E

5|$|Murdoch {{retired from}} the {{military}} on 31December 1969 after completing his term as CAS, which the government had extended for a further twelve months beyond its original three years. He was succeeded by Air Marshal Colin Hannah, whom Murdoch had earlier recommended for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam (the role <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Army officer, as had been previous practice). In 1971, Murdoch joined {{the board of directors}} of Meggitt Limited, an oilseed-crushing firm that was chaired by World WarII fighter ace Nicky Barr. Murdoch continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence after he left the Air Force, joining in 1975 a group of pundits, including retired Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan, who promoted augmenting the country's arsenal with nuclear weaponry. He also followed sport, including horse racing. A resident of Church Point, New South Wales, Sir Alister Murdoch died on 29November 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} pushed {{toward the}} Saar on 25 November and entered Germany on the 28th. The 95th seized a Saar River bridge on 3 December {{and engaged in}} bitter house-to-house fighting for Saarlautern. Suburbs of the city fell and, although the enemy resisted fiercely, the Saar bridgehead was firmly established by 19 December. While some units <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> assembly area, others held the area against strong German attacks. On 2 February 1945, the division began moving to the Maastricht area in the Netherlands, and by 14 February, elements were in the line near Meerselo in relief of British units. During this time the division returned to the Ninth Army under XIX Corps, though saw temporary assignments to several other corps through the spring.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. <b>A</b> multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college.

50|$|It is {{believed}} by Theosophists {{that most people}} (those at high levels of initiation) <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion. For example, Christians <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Christian heaven, Jews <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Jewish heaven, Muslims <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Muslim heaven, Hindus <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hindu heaven, Theosophists <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Theosophical heaven, and so forth, each heaven being like that described in the scriptures of that religion.

People who belong to religions that don't believe in reincarnation are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within <b>a</b> few dozen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few hundred years.

5|$|In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling {{became a}} medal sport {{for the first}} time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink {{finished}} first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, {{but there was a}} strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.|$|E
