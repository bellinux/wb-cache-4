5|$|Later, the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi {{commented that}} the Soviet attack, without a {{declaration}} of war, violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The invasion <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Finnish government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
25|$|Similar demands were {{forwarded}} to Finland, Latvia and Lithuania. Finland resisted, and {{was attacked by}} the Soviet Union on November 30. Because the attack <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> illegal, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations on December 14. Finland held out in the Winter War until March 1940, when the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed.|$|E

The new course begins at sea level {{on the north side}} of the river Tagus, a change which made the course entirely flat. The course for the mass {{participation}} race, which has attracted almost 30,000 runners in previous years, remained unchanged and begins by crossing the Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge before linking up with the new elite course.|$|E

25|$|Aneurin Bevan {{also joined}} the Tredegar {{branch of the}} South Wales Miners' Federation and became a trade union activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at only {{nineteen}} years of age. Bevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the Tredegar Iron Company, as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him sacked. But, {{with the support of}} the Miners' Federation, the case <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} outlawed in July 1947. That month, Ion Mihalache was {{alleged to have}} {{attempted}} to flee the country in an airplane which landed at Tămădău, {{in order to establish}} a government in exile (see Tămădău Affair). This <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> an act of treason, and both Maniu and Mihalache faced a kangaroo court that sentenced them to life imprisonment in a hard labour prison; given their advanced age, this amounted to a death sentence. The show trial, signaling the suppression of opposition groups, was a significant step towards the establishment of an undisguised Communist regime in Romania.|$|E
25|$|In December 1672, King Charles XI came to age. Despite {{what people}} might have anticipated, De la Gardie now became mightier than ever before. The young and inexperienced king {{seems to have been}} glad to take the advice of his Lord High Chancellor De la Gardie, who tried to {{increase}} the king's power in order to increase his own. However, from 1675, his influence decreased. That year, bound by the treaty with France, Sweden entered the Franco-Dutch War by invading Brandenburg. Although being numerically superior, the Swedish forces lost at Fehrbellin, which led to Denmark being encouraged to attack Sweden. Thus, the Scanian War was initiated. In connection with King Charles's coronation the same year, De la Gardie was accused of high treason, an accusation that soon <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> unjustified.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{deviation}} from the von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) postulates paradigm in decision theory. It suggests that it may, in certain circumstances, <b>be</b> rational to <b>judge</b> alternatives according to the issues in their main focus. If these issues are deemed as equal, the alternatives will continue to <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> equal {{even if they are}} mixed with different side-effects - side-effects which would not <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> equal <b>were</b> they to be in the main focus themselves. This contradicts the vNM Independence axiom. Moreover, outcomes of issues in the main focus may completely overshadow the outcomes of the side-issues, so alternatives of the former may <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> infinitely more (or infinitely less) preferable than those of the latter. This contradicts the vNM Continuity axiom...|$|R
25|$|Because of his clear {{contributions}} to the Lý dynasty and the confusing situation of the treason case, Lê Văn Thịnh is still considered today to be a prominent figure in history of the Lý Dynasty in particular, and of Vietnam in general. He was often cited as the pioneer of the Confucian education and study in Vietnam. Although he <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> a criminal of the dynasty, Lê Văn Thịnh is always worshipped by the people in his homeland Bắc Ninh where the former chancellor is the tutelary deity of fourteen villages, there he is considered the symbol of knowledge and the fondness for learning. Each year, the people {{in each of the}} fourteen villages always hold a traditional festival to commemorate the feats of Lê Văn Thịnh. A street in Ho Chi Minh City is also named in honour of Lê Văn Thịnh.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{production}} model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50in (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns {{mounted in the}} fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two 165US Gallon (1,204 litre) drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by 1,000lb (454kg) bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, {{this was due to}} the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for {{them to be able to}} get in and out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{expansion}} Silent Threat, received {{generally less}} favourable reviews. While its stand-alone missions were complemented well for being conceived {{as part of}} a contest by the game's developers - Volition put in a call to the FreeSpace community to stop creating [...] "Battle of Endor"-type missions through FRED, and instead create missions based on Volition's Jason Hoffoss' Zen philosophy of accomplishing more with less - the expansion <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> decent but uninspiring, with many noting that the campaign missions lacked variety than those of standard escort or destroy missions, and offering no new equipment which were unable to compete against the older equipment, with some feeling that the story was worse than the main game due to its [...] "cold and inhuman" [...] briefings and non-player characters.|$|E
500|$|Morton {{questioned}} George Squires, {{who could}} not recall with absolute certainty the path he claimed his family took through the south of England while Canning was missing. [...] His sister Lucy was not called to the stand, as she was considered [...] "rather more stupid than her brother, {{and has not been}} on the road since their coming to Enfield Wash". [...] Robert Willis, who had accompanied Squires to retrace the gypsy family's steps, was also called to testify; his evidence <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> hearsay and ruled inadmissible. [...] As in the trial of Squires and Wells, the reliability of the prosecutor's witnesses was considered dependent upon their character. [...] Three men from Litton Cheney testified that they had seen the Squires family enter the village on 30December. [...] The three Abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence. [...] 39witnesses for the prosecution were heard on the first day alone; most of them establishing briefly the Squires family's alibi.|$|E
500|$|Outside {{his adult}} film career, Donovan {{continued}} to pursue stage work. In 1972 he {{was cast in}} a short-lived Broadway revival of Captain Brassbound's Conversion. Star Ingrid Bergman described him as [...] "having the same kind and as much charisma as Robert Redford." [...] He then landed a small role in the 1973 Lincoln Center production of The Merchant of Venice, which was praised as having [...] "vivid appeal." [...] Donovan had a successful national tour in the play Tubstrip, {{written and directed by}} Jerry Douglas. While the play was critically deemed entertaining enough to its target gay audience (having earned, {{in the words of one}} critic, a [...] "nationwide gay housekeeping seal of approval") Donovan himself <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> simply [...] "no better nor worse [...] actor than most of the others [...]" [...] In 1983 he turned his hand to producing, with an unsuccessful Broadway revival of Terrence McNally's play The Ritz in which he also appeared.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{decision}} to expand its programming to Thursday and Friday nights, UPN picked up six original series. Mercy Point {{was one of two}} science fiction television shows picked up by UPN – [...] the second being the time travel-themed Seven Days. Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News described the network's choice of two science-fiction dramas and two 19th century programs (The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer and Legacy) as showing [...] "a definite bent toward the unusual". Prior to its premiere, the show was promoted through its inclusion of Joe Morton in a starring role. Although Callaway envisioned Mercy Point as a companion to Star Trek: Voyager, UPN paired the Star Trek installment with Seven Days instead. Mercy Point was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9pmEST, following the sitcoms Moesha and Clueless. The Moesha and Clueless block was held over from the previous year. Entertainment Weeklys Dan Snierson noted that Mercy Point faced tough competition from other shows in the same time slot, primarily Just Shoot Me!, Spin City, and Felicity. The series carried a TV-PGparental rating, meaning that it <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> [...] "unsuitable for young children".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} edited by Bob Murawski {{on the set}} using a then {{state-of-the-art}} computerized editing unit that allows the user to edit the film as the movie was being shot. The film was then scored by Graeme Revell who utilized Kodo drummers from Japan. Woo was contractually obligated to release a R rating by Universal Pictures. When submitting the film to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), it <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> too violent and intense for an R rating and received an NC-17 rating. Woo re-edited the film six times for the MPAA as they never indicated what specific scenes they found objectionable. During this editing period, Van Damme went with his own editor {{to make his own}} edit of the film. Van Damme's version excises whole characters to insert more scenes and close-ups of his character Chance. When asked about this edit, Van Damme replied that [...] "People pay their money to see me, not to see Lance Henriksen". The MPAA accepted the film after Woo had made 20 cuts to the film. Scenes cut include the opening chase sequence and the Mardi Gras warehouse sequence. A non-action scene that is cut from the film is a romantic scene between Chance and Natasha.|$|E
500|$|He {{settled in}} Bath, {{on the eastern}} side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden's home. [...] During July and August he {{travelled}} between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke. [...] Johnson's account states that he married the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this. [...] Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed Adventure. [...] By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then Teach was probably operating in Delaware Bay, some distance away. [...] He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke. [...] In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted. [...] A Vice Admiralty Court was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs. [...] The ship <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twentyhogsheads of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixtyto Eden; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel's hold.|$|E

In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be [...] "an impressively powerful phone across the board" [...] due to its high scores on various benchmark tests. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One’s photos were criticized for looking [...] "soft and mushy" [...] due to extensive post-processing and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being [...] "kind of like Vine, except [...] your clips only last a few months and no one’s ever going to use it."
