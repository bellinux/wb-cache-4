5|$|Oates {{signed a}} four-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension with the Blues {{prior to the}} 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> team following the all-star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E

During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} {{were so bad}} that when Liverpool coach Bob Paisley came onto the pitch to attend to an injured player, Shankly entered as well. He managed to give instructions to his players before he was spotted by the officials and ordered off the field. Ajax player Wim Suurbier was carried off with a damaged ankle midway through the first half. He returned to the pitch, but suffered from a limp. Ajax extended their lead in the 39th minute. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith fouled Cruyff outside the Liverpool penalty area. The subsequent free-kick taken by Frits Soetekouw was not cleared by the Liverpool defence and the ball rebounded to Nuninga, who scored to give Ajax a 3–0 lead. The conditions did not only affect the Liverpool players. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, the referee blew his whistle. Swart, assuming that he had signalled half-time began to <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch, was stopped by a steward who pointed out that the match was still ongoing. He re-entered the pitch, received the ball and crossed the ball for Nuninga, who scored to make it 4–0.|$|E

25|$|Although {{technically}} {{an appeal}} {{is required for}} the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand his ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where he considers he might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where {{it is not clear whether}} the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that he is out, if in his own mind he is certain he was out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanlike behaviour.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, {{third baseman}} Anthony Rendon hit his first career grand slam off Braves pitcher Williams Pérez, putting the Nationals on top {{in a game}} {{they went on to}} win 9–7. On September 9, rookie center fielder Trea Turner posted his first multi-homer game, hitting a two-run shot {{followed}} by a solo home run to <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> division rival Philadelphia Phillies 5–4. Latos, making his first start for the Nationals in a September 12 game against the Mets, became the first Nationals pitcher since 2014 to hit a home run, contributing in an 8–1 victory over New York with his solo home run off Mets starter Rafael Montero. In the Nationals' final game of the season against their New York rivals on September 14, a 1–0 win, second baseman Daniel Murphy went 1-for-2 with a walk, thereby recording at least one hit in every game he played against the team he was with during the previous season. He became the first National League player in 12 years to hit in every game of a season series of at least 19 games and set a record for the longest single-season hitting streak against a previous-year team dating back to the creation of divisions in the major leagues in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The season {{starts with}} a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley, which is widely {{anticipated}} as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and {{are in danger of}} relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.|$|E
