500|$|The brigade was {{advancing}} in quarter column {{as directed}} by Methuen's orders. [...] The soldiers advanced packed as closely together as possible, with each ordered to grasp his neighbour {{to prevent the}} men losing {{contact with each other}} in the darkness. As first light approached, the storm abated and the Brigade was on course, but the delays put them [...] from the line of hills. Wauchope's guide, Major Benson of the Royal Artillery, suggested to Wauchope that it was no longer safe to continue in closed formation and that the Brigade should deploy. Wauchope replied [...] "... I'm afraid my men will lose direction. I think <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> a little further." [...] Still in quarter column, the Highlanders advanced further towards the unknown enemy lines, when an advancing British soldier tripped an alarm on the fence in front of the Boer trench.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means over yet. We will win easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters. I agree we had some luck in Amsterdam, but I am sure <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> through." ...|$|E

He was doubtful {{of his colleagues}} reluctance {{to negotiate with the}} Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri. Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs [...] "We have money, and you will have your share if you join us. If not, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as [...] "the Fighting Rifles" [...] surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: [...] "Surrender the city or be annihilated". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called [...] "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units [...] "to defend the republic".

2500|$|Nehru, while a pacifist, was not {{blind to}} the {{political}} and geostrategic reality of India in 1947.

It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, {{we have to face}} all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away.

2500|$|The Stooge films {{made between}} 1935 and 1941 {{captured}} {{the team at}} their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. Hoi Polloi (1935) adapted the premise of Pygmalion, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Pies and Guys (1958). Three Little Beers (1935) featured the Stooges running amok {{on a golf course}} to win prize money. Disorder in the Court (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. Violent is the Word for Curly (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude [...] "Swingin' the Alphabet". In A Plumbing <b>We</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Go</b> (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home. Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including Uncivil Warriors (1935), A Pain in the Pullman (1936), False Alarms (also 1936), Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), The Sitter Downers (also 1937), Dizzy Doctors (also 1937), Tassels in the Air (1938), We Want Our Mummy (1939), Nutty but Nice (1940), An Ache in Every Stake (1941) and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (also 1941).|$|E
