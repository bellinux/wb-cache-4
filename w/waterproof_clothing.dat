25|$|A {{reliable}} local guide from Tinglayan (where {{reasonable accommodation}} is available) {{can take you}} to either Tulgao or Sumadel by foot – about 3 hours hike.

25|$|The castle may be {{approached}} from two directions. From Llangollen the path starts from Canal Bridge and runs beside Ysgol Dinas Brân. It gradually climbs past several cottages before opening {{out onto the}} lower slopes of the hill. A zigzag path then climbs to the summit. The other route starts from 'Offa's Dyke Path' on the north {{western side of the}} hill. This route is shorter but steeper. Official advice is to equip yourself with stout walking shoes and warm, <b>waterproof</b> <b>clothing</b> before climbing to the castle.|$|E

50|$|Waterproof/breathable fabrics resist {{liquid water}} passing through, but allow water vapour to pass through. Their ability {{to block out}} rain and snow while {{allowing}} vapour from sweat to evaporate leads to their use in rainwear, <b>waterproof</b> outdoor sports <b>clothing,</b> tents, and other applications.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there is}} a chance that these water {{pressure}} activated inflation devices do not inflate the life jacket if a person is wearing <b>waterproof</b> <b>clothing</b> and falls into the water face-down. In these cases the buoyancy of the clothing holds a person on the water surface, which prevents the hydrostatic release. As a result, a person can drown although wearing a fully functional life jacket. In addition there are some circumstances in which the use of self-triggering devices can result in the wearer becoming trapped underwater. For example, the coxswain of a bowloader rowing shell risks being unable to escape should the craft capsize.|$|E
25|$|Fish (neqa sg neqek dual neqet pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik neqa or iqallug in Cup'ig) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Yup'ik foods. Fish skins (neqet amiit or amirak ~ amiraq in Yup'ik) and {{intestines}} are used for <b>waterproof</b> <b>clothing</b> (amiragglugaq) in a few areas, especially in southern coastal Alaska. For example, commercial herring fishers from Toksook Bay, Alaska still prefer intestine parkas to heavy-duty raincoats, as they are lighter and allow body vapor to pass through the skin membrane while preventing rain from entering. In former times, rather crudely made shirts without hoods were made of local salmon or trout skins. Through rarely used today, in the past fish skin was also used for waterproof boots (amirak ~ amiraq) and mittens (arilluk) also parka (qasperrluk), making these items water-repellent and durable. Fish skin was also used to make parkas, mittens, and pants for summer use. The sinew for fish skins known as yualunguaq (fish-skin thread).|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>waterproof</b> {{breathable}} <b>clothing</b> has steadily been increaseing {{over the past}} two decades. The technology for developing waterproof breathable textiles is focussed around two key aspects: The polymer membrane that is laminated onto the fabric to render it waterproof and breathable and the lamination technology with allows the proper adhesion of the membrane and fabric. Numerous breakthroughts have been made {{over the past two}} decades with regard to the development of new polymer membranes for clothing lamination. These membranes are however patent protected and expensive.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{incidents}} at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities involving {{the migration of}} radioactive contaminants through protective clothing. The authors analyzed 68 occurrence reports for the following factors: (1) type of work; (2) working conditions; (3) type of anti-contamination (anti-C) material; (4) area of body or clothing contaminated; and (5) nature of spread of contamination. A majority of reports identified strenuous work activities such as maintenance, construction, or decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) projects. The reports also indicated adverse working conditions that included hot and humid or cramped work environments. The type of anti-C clothing most often identified was cotton or water-resistant, disposable clothing. Most of the reports also indicated contaminants migrating through perspiration-soaked areas, typically in the knees and forearms. On {{the basis of their}} survey, the authors recommend the use of improved engineering controls and resilient, breathable, <b>waterproof</b> protective <b>clothing</b> for work in hot, humid, or damp areas where the possibility of prolonged contact with contamination cannot be easily avoided or controlled...|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} of TS-PU and applications to textile production are explored, with the microstructure and water-vapour transport property leading to intelligent, breathable textile products. Temperature-sensitive polymer refers to polyurethane (PU) whose water-vapour transport properties may increase significantly with temperature rise. Potential applications in textile {{production and the}} medical area are examined. Early developments from Horii et al (1992), Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, Diaplex Co., Ltd. and Graham-Rowe are reported. Research work by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University is described measuring the water-vapour transport property of three kinds of waterproof and breathable fabrics (WBFs). The microstructure of TS-PU is examined and comparisons are drawn with ordinary PU.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, a Scot named Edward Le Roy emigrated to New Zealand. He {{was able to}} {{manufacture}} oilskin rainwear for use by sailors on sailing ships in the local waters at the time. The garments were originally constructed from the lightweight sails of the sailing ships. The <b>waterproofing</b> of the <b>clothing</b> was by application of linseed oil to the cotton. T. E. Pearson, the son of E. J. Pearson who started Pearson Soap in Hamilton, New Zealand, took a consignment of Leroy Coats to Australia. Stockmen at the time had gathered news of this garment from sailors who had subsequently left sailing {{to work on the}} land. Because the garments were flammable around campfires, T. E. Pearson worked on developing a new formula for sealing the coats. He did this in the backyard shed of his home in Kangaroo Street, Manly. Pearson subsequently, in partnership with Leroy, registered the trademark. T.E. died in 1964 and is buried in Frenchs Forest, New South Wales.|$|R
