5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire {{came up with an}} entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E
25|$|After Muhammad {{would receive}} revelations {{he would later}} recite it to his companions, who also memorized it or <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> Before the Quran was {{commonly}} available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practiced among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in its original Arabic. This fact, taken {{in the context of}} 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.|$|E

25|$|During the journey, a phone begins ringing, but {{the group}} cannot work out whose it is. Ed {{believes}} the ringing {{is coming from the}} boot, so Chris pulls {{over to the side of}} the road. The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work out what to do with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> while I was thinking out the prelude. I {{only hope that}} {{you will be able to}} read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

The conversation that was produced by this question impressed Munroe's mother {{to such a degree}} that she <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> Though Munroe later stated that his question was rather meaningless, he used it as an example of how [...] "thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places".|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|Although {{book editor}} and {{university}} instructor James Michener could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright Quaker, he {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Navy in October 1942. [...] He was not sent to the South Pacific theater until April 1944, when {{he was assigned to}} write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. [...] He survived a plane crash in New Caledonia; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the Treasury Islands, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by [...] "scrawny residents and only one pig". [...] Struck by the name, Michener <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of Espiritu Santo, he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red betel juice. [...] Punctuated with profanity learned from GIs, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other Tonkinese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. [...] She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in French Indochina. These stories, collected into Tales of the South Pacific, won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.|$|E

[...] Bonner <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> edited the material the following year, and offered the book to Harper & Brothers in New York. The Life and Adventures of James P.

2500|$|In 1856, Carson {{told his}} life story to someone who <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> This book is called Memoirs.

The lost manuscript {{was found in a}} trunk in Paris in 1905. It was later printed. The first biography of Carson was written by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859.

Gangnim told Yeomra to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> on words. Yeomra thus tattooed his vow on Gangnim's back, <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> in the script of the Underworld.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first known}} melody {{written for the}} song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was {{published}} in The Congregationalist. By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written. A hymn tune composed by Samuel A. Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to {{him while he was}} on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City, after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn [...] "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work [...] "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled [...] "America the Beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keith Morris was the {{photographer}} who took Drake's photo {{for the cover}} of Bryter Layter (1971) and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of Pink Moon. However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around {{the cover of the}} LP: [...] "I remember going to talk to , and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> <b>down...</b> he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell me what he wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on." [...] Island picked a piece of surrealist Dali-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of Pink Moon, many close to him felt that he approved.|$|E
