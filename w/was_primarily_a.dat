5|$|After her {{drama school}} education, Leigh {{appeared}} in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed {{to the role}} of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh <b>was</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>a</b> stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai <b>was</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>a</b> leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E

Harris explained that Hi-5 <b>was</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>a</b> television series, but the music itself had the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank.

Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E

A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway <b>was</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>a</b> passenger-carrying railway {{which used}} {{most of its}} {{resources}} to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E

Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from Lisle and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966.

5|$|The {{second of}} James Cook's {{historic}} voyages, 1772–1775, <b>was</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>a</b> {{search for the}} elusive Terra Australis Incognita that was still believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below 40°S. Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, HMS Resolution and HMS Adventure. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales. They managed to edge further south, encountering their first pack ice on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through. Eventually, he found open water, {{and was able to}} continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the Antarctic Circle at 66°20'S, the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.|$|E

Leyba was warned by a fur trader in late March 1780 that the British were planning an attack on St. Louis and the nearby American post at Cahokia. He began developing plans for the village's defense. He had an inexperienced militia force of 168 dispersed around the surrounding countryside and only 29 regular army soldiers of the Fijo de Luisiana Colonial Regiment.|$|E

Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E
