500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this – <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E

[...] The show is, however, produced by the BBC along with McKeown's production company, Allan McKeown Presents (now run by Ullman) [...] "So he is still presenting me..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 November, Dibaba won the Zevenheuvelenloop 15 {{kilometres}} {{road race}} in Nijmegen, Netherlands {{in a world}} best time of 46:28. This bettered Kayoko Fukushi's previous world best by almost half a minute. (Dibaba's record was broken by Florence Kiplagat on 15 February 2015.) This was her first competitive road race since 2005, but she downplayed the idea of moving on to road running, stating that the track remained her priority. Her 5 kilometre splits were 15:58 – 15:25 – 15:05. She said, [...] "Although I trained a lot together <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> for this race, a roadrace is something different. I {{did not know what}} I could expect. Therefore, I was not that fast in the beginning. ... After 10 kilometres, I pressed the pace and in the final three kilometres it felt like flying. It feels good as you hear after the finish that your husband also has won." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{her first}} major junior tournament {{she won the}} silver medal, setting a new 800m {{personal}} best of 2:03.81 at the 1999 European Athletics Junior Championships. She competed at the European Athletics U23 Championships in 2001, finishing in fifth place. Krevsun came second at the 2001 national championships, and won the competition in 2002. That year, Krevsun competed at the European Cup (finishing in sixth), and competed at the European Athletics Championships for the first time, but did not progress beyond the heats. She represented Ukraine at the 2003 World Championships, but again lost in the heats. She grew dissatisfied with athletics in the 2003 and 2004 seasons, and she decided {{to start a family}} instead; her first son, Danil, was born in 2005. Reflecting on the situation she said [...] "I was dissatisfied and decided {{to put an end to}} my athletics career. I wanted a quiet life, romantic dinners <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> and a baby’s laugh in our home." ...|$|E

"Had we {{been blessed}} with children," [...] she was wont on such {{occasions}} to say to herself, [...] "had our blood been united in a son who might have joined my advantages of descent <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> personal worth, these painful and irksome reflections had not disturbed our union even for a moment. But {{the existence of such}} an heir, in whom our affections, as well as our pretensions, might have centred, has been denied to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the movie}} Highway to Hell, the phrase is taken {{literally}} {{to create one}} particular scene. The Good Intentions Paving Company has a team of Andy Warhols who grind good-intentioned souls into pavement. [...] "I was only sleeping <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> boss to advance his career", says one. The figurative meaning of the phrase {{is a big part}} of the plot too, as several characters offer help to the two protagonists on the Road to Hell, but all of them have ulterior motives.|$|R

6000|$|... "I daresay I am very stupid, Mr. Dodd," [...] began Mamie, with an {{alarming}} sweetness, [...] "but I thought you went upon this trip as <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> representative and <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> money? You tell us {{now that you}} are pledged, but I should have thought you were pledged first of all to James. You say it does not concern us; we are poor people, and <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is sick, and it concerns {{us a great deal}} to understand how we come to have lost our money, and why our representative comes back to us with nothing. You ask that we should trust you; you do not seem to understand--the question we are asking ourselves is whether we have not trusted you too much." ...|$|R

60|$|He hurried {{round with}} me at once in the same cab to the court. The incriminated will had been 'impounded,' as they call it; but, under certain restrictions, and subject to the closest surveillance, I was allowed to examine it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> solicitor, before {{the eyes of the}} authorities. I looked at it long with the naked eye and also with a small pocket lens. The paper, as I had noted before, was the same kind of {{foolscap}} as that which I had been in the habit of using at my office in Florence; and the typewriting--was it mine? The longer I looked at it, the more I doubted it.|$|R

60|$|After {{some little}} pause to recover himself, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> came up <b>with</b> me, {{and gave the}} mate thanks for the kindness, which he had {{expressed}} to us, and sent suitable acknowledgment by him to the captain, offering to pay him by advance, whatever he demanded for our passage, and for the conveniences he had helped us to. The mate {{told him that the}} captain would be on board in the afternoon, and that he would leave all that till he came. Accordingly, in the afternoon the captain came, and we found him the same courteous, obliging man that the boatswain had represented him to be; and he was so well pleased <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> conversation, that, in short, he would not let us keep the cabin we had chosen, but gave us one that, as I said before, opened into the great cabin.|$|R

6000|$|My great wish is {{that this}} small book, by the easy method of its contents, may attract the {{attention}} of those persons who are yet unacquainted <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> writings; {{of the men and women}} of leisure, who, although they may have heard of the [...] "Essays," [...] do not care to work their way through the nine volumes; of others who would like to read them, but who have either no time to do so or coin wherewith to buy them. More especially do I hope that these selections may {{attract the attention of}} the working man, whose cause <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> so ardently espoused, and to whom he was the first to reveal, by his free lectures, the loveliness of Nature, the many rainbow-coloured rays of science, and to show forth to his listeners how all these glorious rays unite in the one pure white light of holy truth.|$|R

60|$|I sprang out of bed. The very man I {{wanted was}} waiting to see me! Major Fitz-David, as the phrase is, knew everybody. Intimate <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> he would {{certainly}} know my husband's old friend--Miserrimus Dexter.|$|E
