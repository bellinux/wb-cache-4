5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|Altar 6 is a plain {{monument}} {{that was}} found in Group 21 together with Stela 10. Like its associated stela it had been moved from its original location in antiquity but <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> moved far.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> {{constructed as}} an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
5|$|His origins are unknown, but he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> {{a native}} Englishman. He {{may have been}} German or Norman. The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> much wetter than today, except in the {{mountains}} where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E

5|$|The {{algorithm}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> {{discovered by}} Euclid, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his Elements. The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians {{in the school}} of Pythagoras. The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus (about 375 BC). The algorithm may even pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις (anthyphairesis, reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|What {{has been}} {{thought to be}} his mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass {{announced}} that the mummy which was previously thought to be Thutmose I {{is that of a}} thirty-year-old man who had {{died as a result of}} an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it was determined that the mummy <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> that of King Thutmose I himself.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held {{lands in}} Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl settled {{a number of}} his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new lands in Sussex and Shropshire. Pantulf <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> present at the Battle of Hastings, likely due to Earl Roger's lack of participation in the campaign of conquest. Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's lands in England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem. Although he had substantial lands in England, Pantulf continued to spend most of his time on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> a town.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the Khalids were pardoned {{and allowed}} back to Bahrain after {{the leaders of}} the Shia {{community}} in Sitra were persuaded that the Khalids would not attack their villages again. Ibrahim bin Khalid, the eldest of the Khalids, who was exiled to Zubara (Qatar) for 10 years, was convicted in 1929 of being responsible for a failed assassination attempt on the ruler, his first cousin, in 1926. Instead of getting tried, the ruler appointed Ibrahim at his Sakhir Palace. His brother Salman, originally exiled for 10 years, was allowed back in 1928, while Abdulla <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> exiled as he was an infant when the 1923 and 1924 incidents occurred.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse legal traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent legal system, summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early legal handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new legal system and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> personally responsible for creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct the reforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 620s or early 630s, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, the British (Welsh) king of Gwynedd, became {{involved}} in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who {{is thought to have}} been the lesser partner in their alliance, to defeat the Northumbrians in October 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. Penda <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> yet king of the Mercians, but he is thought to have become king soon afterwards, based on Bede's characterisation of his position. Edwin was killed in the battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda's hands.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> {{directly}} ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> the case. A {{document}} from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being {{in the third year}} of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
