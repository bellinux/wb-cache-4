Legge notes that pu means [...] "the <b>rough</b> fashioning of <b>the</b> work" [...] and zhou means [...] "the fine finish given to it". Karlgren (1970:313) quotes the Han commentator Ma Rong that po 樸 denotes [...] "wood {{that has not yet}} been worked into a utensil; unworked wood", and concludes po means [...] "to treat <b>the</b> unworked <b>wood</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>rough</b> cutting); to trim" [...] is a variation of the same stem as pu 樸 [...] "in a natural state; simple".|$|R
