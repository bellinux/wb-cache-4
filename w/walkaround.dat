25|$|For decades Johns {{worked with}} others to raise both funds and {{attention}} for Merce Cunningham’s choreography. He privately assisted Robert Rauschenberg {{in some of his}} 1950s designs for Cunningham. In spring 1963, Johns helped start the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, then intended to sponsor and raise funds in the performance field; the other founders were John Cage, Elaine de Kooning, the designer David Hayes, and the theater producer Lewis B. Lloyd. Johns later was the Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s artistic adviser from 1967 to 1980. In 1968 Johns and Cunningham made a Duchamp-inspired theater piece, <b>Walkaround</b> Time, in which Johns’s décor replicates elements of Duchamp’s work The Large Glass (1915–23). Earlier, Johns also wrote neodada lyrics for The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music art band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community.|$|E

2500|$|The Christy Minstrels {{established}} {{the basic structure}} of the minstrel show in the 1840s. A crowd-gathering parade to the theater often preceded the performance. The show itself was divided into three major sections. During the first, the entire troupe danced onto stage singing a popular song. Upon the instruction of the interlocutor, a sort of host, they sat in a semicircle. Various stock characters always took the same positions: the genteel interlocutor in the middle, flanked by Tambo and Bones, who served as the endmen or cornermen. The interlocutor acted as a master of ceremonies and as a dignified, if pompous, straight man. He had a somewhat aristocratic demeanor, a [...] "codfish aristocrat", while the endmen exchanged jokes and performed a variety of humorous songs. Over time, the first act came to include maudlin numbers not always in dialect. One minstrel, usually a tenor, came to specialize in this part; such singers often became celebrities, especially with women. Initially, an upbeat plantation song and dance ended the act; later it was more common for the first act to end with a <b>walkaround,</b> including dances in the style of a cakewalk.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>walkaround</b> (also spelled {{walk-around}} or walk around, or {{called a}} horay) was a dance from the blackface minstrel shows of the 19th century. The <b>walkaround</b> {{began in the}} 1840s as a dance for one performer, but by the 1850s, many dancers or the entire troupe participated. The <b>walkaround</b> often served as the finale to {{the first half of}} the minstrel show, the opening semicircle. Minstrels also wrote songs called [...] "walkarounds", which were specifically intended for this dance; [...] "Dixie" [...] is probably the most famous example.|$|E

Because each staff member has an equal voice in discussing patient safety concerns, the program enables all employees—union and nonunion alike—to engage directly in discussions about improving patient safety.

40|$|Since {{the release}} of the IOM report To Err Is Human in 1999, {{significant}} {{progress has been made in}} patient safety. One of the remaining challenges is the need to continually improve the culture of safety. This is a long-term proposition, and one that must be driven foremost by our leaders. In a consensus statement from the National Quality Forum, Dr. Kenneth Kizer pointed out, “There simply is nothing more important in overseeing a hospital or other health care facility than ensuring it is as safe as possible for patients. ” Improving patient safety should be among the highest priorities of health care leaders and managers. To lead patient safety improvements, executives must be visible and must take an active role in patient safety. To this end, Kaiser Permanente has designed and implemented Patient Safety Executive <b>Walkarounds</b> as a tool for leaders to (1) visibly demonstrate patient safety as a high organizational priority, and (2) learn from direct care staff and physicians about near misses, errors, and hazards that jeopardize patient safety.

50|$|The Constable Care mascot {{can be seen}} at {{upwards of}} 60 {{community}} events across Perth and Western Australia each year, including Telethon events, the Perth Christmas Pageant, Perth Royal Show, Mandurah Crab Fest, Joondalup Festival and many other metropolitan and regional events. The non-speaking mascot's role is to interact with children and families at events to provide a positive first experience of police for young children. The mascot and a trained helper undertake event <b>walkarounds,</b> stopping for photographs and giving away handouts such as stickers and cardboard police hats. At larger events such as the Telethon Kids Carnival, the mascot takes part in safety-themed song and dance performances on stage with actors from the Constable Care Performance Company. The Constable Care mascot was recognised at a ceremony in June 2014 at the Western Australian Police Academy for 25 years of service to the WA community, receiving the regimental number 12020 and the status of Senior Constable. At a ceremony in August 2014, the Commissioner of WA Police Karl O'Callaghan presented the mascot with a 25-year service medal. In May 2016 Western Australia Police filmed a video featuring the Constable Care mascot dancing with uniformed officers as part of the worldwide online Running Man Challenge. The video was published on the WA Police Facebook page and has been watched over 1.2 million times.|$|R

Despite the publisher's claim that [...] "I'm Going Home to Dixie" [...] had been [...] "Sung with tumultuous applause by the popular Bryant's Minstrels", the song lacked the charm of its predecessor, and it quickly faded into obscurity.
