John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, gave the episode a positive review and complimented its exploration of Reyes' character. He rated it an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "overall, a wonderful unexpected {{look into the}} underlying motivations of a character that, until now, has been only vaguely drawn for the audience. Thankfully it is completely consistent with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> before". Keegan added that the [...] "greatest drawback may be that we are unlikely to see this theme explored much further, since this is now officially the final season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze" [...] and the fourth season episode [...] "The Field Where I Died"—calling the writing [...] "delightfully subtle". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the skinless bodies [...] "the high point of the series' trading in gore". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "unexpectedly entertaining" [...] and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.|$|E

"The ironic thing, {{is if we}} had {{put this}} to delegates {{a couple of weeks}} ago, before the {{international}} pro-Israeli lobby started this massive campaign emailing delegates and trying to deny us our democratic right to discuss whatever we like, it probably wouldn't have passed. People feel bullied, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> is a hardening of attitudes. All they achieved was making the delegates determined to debate and pass the motion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics in the Southwest Journal of Pulmonary & Critical Care said, [...] "the present Choosing Wisely {{campaign}} has fundamental flawsnot {{because it is}} medically wrong but because it attempts to replace choice and good judgment with a rigid set of rules that undoubtedly will have many exceptions. Based on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> so far, we suspect that Choosing Wisely is much more about saving money than improving patient care. We also predict {{it will be used}} by the unknowing or unscrupulous to further interfere with the doctor-patient relationship." ...|$|E

60|$|It was our duty, however, to {{know exactly}} who it was encamped so near Brant's village, and, after telling Jacob in a whisper of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> the old soldier made his way swiftly through the thicket, my comrade and I copying his every movement.|$|R
60|$|So, still oppressed {{with fear}} and wonder--for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> was perhaps more dreadful than {{anything}} that had gone before--we went, to find Ayesha seated and looking somewhat weary, but otherwise unchanged. With her was the priestess Papave, who had just unrobed her of the royal mantle which she wore in the Sanctuary.|$|R
2500|$|During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said: [...] "I {{think this}} is about sheer criminality. That is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> on the streets. The {{violence}} we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it." [...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now." ...|$|E

60|$|He acquiesced in {{the justice}} of this answer, but fain would have had us gone to see the woody part {{of the hill and}} the edge of the desert, that we might see how the elephants' teeth lay {{scattered}} up and down there; but when we told him the story of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> before, as is said above, he said no more.|$|R

60|$|But {{my present}} work was to return; so we mounted our mules, and had, in the meantime, the {{pleasure}} of contemplating <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> and applying ourselves to such farther measures as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> concerted among us. In about four hours we returned to our camp, as I called it, and, by the way, we found, to our no little pain, that though <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come down hill easily and insensibly to the opening for some miles, yet <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a hard pull uphill to go back again.|$|R

2500|$|Gavin {{was very}} {{concerned}} about the fact that US Army vehicles, weapons, and ammunition were at best a copy of the German equipment. [...] "It would not be sufficient to copy the Germans," [...] he declared. For the first time, Gavin talked about using airborne forces: [...] "From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> so far, it was clear the most promising area of all was airborne warfare, bringing the parachute troops and the glider troops to the battlefield in masses, especially trained, armed, and equipped for that kind of warfare." ...|$|R

5000|$|Though {{the last}} lion {{of what is}} now Pakistan was thought to have been killed near Kot Diji in Sindh Province in 1810, a British Admiral, while {{traveling}} on a train accompanied by two others, reportedly saw a maneless lion eating a goat near Quetta in 1935. He wrote [...] "It was a large lion, very stocky, light tawny in colour, and I may say that no one of us three had the slightest doubt of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> until, on our arrival at Quetta, many officers expressed doubts as to its identity, or to the possibility of there being a lion in the district." ...|$|R

6000|$|Such bombastic {{style was}} then common, but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> of Beaupuy [...] in this sketch {{shows that he}} had through his career united Nestor's [...] {{prudence}} [B] with Achilles' bodily courage and Bayard's chivalric [...] spirit,--to use {{the language of the}} time.|$|E
60|$|Timidly, with hearts beating fast, {{but with}} not one thought of turning back, nor any fear of vagrants--for we were now sure that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> was not flesh and blood, and {{therefore}} harmless--we crossed {{the open space}} and entered a street down which the moon shone clearly. Here and there we saw dim figures, which quickly disappeared; but, approaching a low stone balcony {{in front of one}} of the houses, we were surprised to see, sitting thereon and leaning over a book which lay open upon the top of the carved parapet, the figure of a woman who did not appear to notice us.|$|R

60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> some {{service and}} Captain Brooke {{has been through}} more {{fighting}} than any other officer of late years. We were so profoundly impressed by the spectacle and situation that we resolved to go and tell Sir Charles Warren <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> The fight <b>had</b> been so close that no proper reports {{had been sent to}} the General, so he listened with great patience and attention. One thing was quite clear--unless good and efficient cover could be made during the night, and unless guns could be dragged to the summit of the hill to match the Boer artillery, the infantry could not, perhaps would not, endure another day. The human machine will not stand certain strains for long.|$|R

'Nay! but,' I persisted, 'you are a man, {{judging from}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> of your courage and skill {{in the use}} of your weapons, who would gain speedy preferment in any army.

40|$|The images {{revealed}} a roughly stomach-shaped {{structure in the}} left lower abdomen whose time course of appearance and intensity of labeling very closely paralleled those of the stomach (Fig. I).

The orientation of this abnormality in the patient matched <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> on the nuclear images. This was resected and primary anastomosis performed. The child re covered without complication. The resected bowel showed a duplication with an outpouching at its proximal end that contained gastric mucosa and a pylorus.

The Sambúk received a cargo of quarrymen and sacks, in order to ship at Makná the [...] "argentiferous galena" [...] and other rocks left by Lieutenant Yusuf and M. Philipin upon the shore; and, that done, she was directed to rejoin us at Tírán Island. As long as the norther coursed high, she beat us hollow; in the afternoon, however, when the gale, as usual, abated, she fell off, perhaps purposely, not wishing to pass a night in the open. By sunset her white sail had clean disappeared, having slipped into some snug cove.|$|R
