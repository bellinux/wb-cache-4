5|$|On August 11, 1952, Williams was {{dismissed}} from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana {{to perform in}} KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but {{despite the efforts of}} his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.|$|E
5|$|After Kidd's {{arrival in}} Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written {{account of his}} travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver {{on the morning of}} 6 July. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> do so, Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was {{executed}} as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day. Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips. Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged. In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd, Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as £5,000 to overlook illicit activities.|$|E

5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> return from leave; he had made no mention to Taylor of his intention to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arrival at}} the Ely Road, a small {{detachment}} of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east. The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street. The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near {{the west end of}} Station Road. The militia were called to the front when the rioters would not come out after being ordered to by Bate Dudley. Thomas South, shooting from a window, hit trooper Wallace in the forearm. The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by the troopers. Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters. Those captured were taken to Ely gaol {{and the rest of the}} rioters were rounded up.|$|E
5|$|While he had {{no desire}} to be a manager, Liddell, as a shareholder, had wanted to become a Liverpool director; however, his {{repeated}} applications to board elections were unsuccessful. He continued to play football for a magistrates' team until he decided to focus on tennis after breaking a cheek bone. In 1967, Liddell and other footballing personalities appeared in a charity match to generate funds for Bankfield House Community Centre. More than 10,000 people watched Liddell play opposite retired Hungarian international Ferenc Puskás at South Liverpool's Holly Park ground, raising £1,100 in the process. He later became chairman of Littlewoods' Spot the Ball panel and president of the Liverpool FC Supporters Club. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the early 1990s, Liddell resigned from the panel on the insistence of Phyllis. His wife had first noticed atypical behaviour on a visit to Anfield following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> appear able to register what had happened in Sheffield. When his condition worsened, Liddell moved to a nursing home in Mossley Hill. He died on 3 July 2001, within a week of the deaths of former Liverpool manager Joe Fagan and director Tom Saunders.|$|E
