500|$|Mega Man 6 was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the franchise's first spin-off, Mega Man X for Nintendo's newer console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next. After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, so <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|E

I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Following the 1968 Soviet {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia, private property was nationalized. In 1972, Tichý was evicted from his studio, his work {{thrown into the}} street. He stopped drawing and painting and concentrated only on photography, working in the disorderly conditions of his home. Of the transition, he says, [...] "The paintings were already painted, the drawings drawn. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? I looked for new media. With the help of photography I saw everything in a new light. It was a new world." ...|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{the event}} afterwards, Blake stated, [...] "I wasn't {{trying to do}} {{anything}} to that Parks woman except do my job. She was in violation of the city codes, so <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? That damn bus was full and she wouldn't move back. I had my orders. I had police powers—any driver for the city did. So the bus filled up and a white man got on, and she had his seat and I told her to move back, and she wouldn't do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the filming}} of Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), Crawford {{acknowledged}} to visiting reporter/author Lawrence J. Quirk the difficulty she was having with Davis because of the Oscar incident but added, [...] "She acted like Baby Jane was a one-woman show after they nominated her. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do, let her hog all the glory, act like I hadn't even been in the movie? She got the nomination. I didn't begrudge her that, {{but it would have}} been nice if she'd been a little gracious in interviews and given me a little credit. I would have done it for her." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Little Fish, an uncharacteristically cheerful one-act musical for LaChiusa, {{based on}} two short stories by Deborah Eisenberg, premiered Off-Broadway. The show's failure sent LaChiusa into a funk; he recalled, [...] "I went, 'My God, they don't want the hard stuff and more {{challenging}} material here in this city from me.

5000|$|Owens helped {{promote the}} {{exploitation}} film Mom and Dad in African American neighborhoods. He {{tried to make}} a living as a sports promoter, essentially an entertainer. He would give local sprinters a ten- or twenty-yard start and beat them in the 100-yd (91-m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses; as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung thoroughbred that would be frightened by the starter's shotgun and give him a bad jump. Owens said, [...] "People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals." [...] On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, [...] "There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway." ...|$|E

Burn - A List of my Enemies, {{his column}} in his Bavarian High School newspaper, run for five {{consecutive}} years, hitting his targets with caustic wit and irony. The list of enemies ranged from Bavarian farms (compulsory normality) to television companies (the rule of mediocrity) to Paris Hilton (trivia domination). Before graduating from high school, Scatman finished his last column with the following sentence: ‘Please tell me, <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to conjure up as a grandiose finale for the end of this five-year series?...|$|R
5000|$|According to the memoir, Pearson {{says her}} life was turned around upon {{learning}} in prison that a close friend and drug dealer, whom she called [...] "Uncle", was killed. Pearson said of her decision to write her book, [...] "I just want {{to let people know}} where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story." [...] The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing. During an interview about the book, she said, [...] "Every time I turned around, they kept firing me, so where else could I turn to? The streets never let you down. That's sad to say, but <b>what</b> (<b>was)</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be, starving? Go to a shelter?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] "Man's hand transforms into {{a gun and}} {{you can actually see}} it come out of his arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] Across the series Mega Man was given new skills to add more variety to the gameplay. For Mega Man 6, after having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adapter assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this.

In 2014, the retired coach said: [...] "Yes, I had issues with him. He was a fiery character who {{felt he had}} to play. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do, get rid of Zlatko Vujović who was every coach's dream and put in Savićević who was perhaps a better player, but with whom you never knew what he's going to give you on the pitch in a given match. Savićević {{is one of the best}} players I ever coached, but he also fell victim to some bad advice at that time. Today we've got decent relations, we talked it all out.... Back during the time of those frosty relations with Savićević, for me personally it got to the point where I lost the will to coach. I got sick of going to practice knowing I'll be looking at Savićević, that we'll be staring each other down, that he'll be unhappy for not playing.... I was unhappy about that too".|$|E

But he got unexpected assistance. A ship passed through the Dedemsvaart, and it may be a big coincidence, but Klaos suddenly told the woman: [...] "Turn around and have a look at what it says on that ship".

5000|$|... “In Kiev I {{learned that}} {{people close to}} the Helsinki Group were being {{repressed}} in the most flagrant manner. This at least had been the case in the trials of Ovsiyenko, Horbal, Lytvyn, and they were soon to deal similarly with Chornovil and Rozumny. I didn’t want that kind of Kiev. Seeing that the Group had been left rudderless, I joined it because I couldn’t do otherwise … When life is taken away, I had no need of pitiful crumbs. Psychologically I understood that the prison gates had already opened for me and that any day now they would close behind me - and close for a long time. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? Ukrainians were not able to leave the country, and anyway I didn’t particularly want to go beyond those borders since who then, here, in Great Ukraine, would become the voice of indignation and protest? This was my fate, and you don’t choose your fate. You accept it, whatever that fate may be. And when you don’t accept it, it takes you by force … However I had no intention of bowing my head down, whatever happened. Behind me was Ukraine, my oppressed people, whose honour I had to defend or perish". (“Z tabornoho zoshyta" [...] the camp notebook", 1983).|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until the}} 1940s, the full revenue {{potential}} {{of what was}} called [...] "the Negro market" [...] was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. with advertising focused on whites. Blacks were also denied commercial deals. On his decision {{to take part in}} exhibition races against racehorses in order to earn money, Olympic champion Jesse Owens stated, [...] "People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals." [...] On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, [...] "There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway." [...] In the reception to honor his Olympic success Owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator. The first black Academy Award recipient Hattie McDaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere of Gone with the Wind with Georgia being racially segregated, and at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles she was required to sit at a segregated table at the far wall of the room; the hotel had a strict no-blacks policy, but allowed McDaniel in as a favor.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{internment}} in Romania, Rydz-Śmigły {{initiated the}} creation of a Polish underground originating from officers who were loyal to the memory of Piłsudski. Still in Romania, on 27 October, he relinquished his function as the Commander-in-Chief and Inspector-General of the Armed Forces. This role was assumed by Władysław Sikorski, who was serving in the new Polish government-in-exile in France (and after 1940 in the United Kingdom).In the autumn of 1939, Polish journalist Melchior Wańkowicz met Beck, also in interment, and he managed to talk to him for a few hours. This is what Wańkowicz wrote about this meeting: [...] "It was completely impossible to get to Rydz, as he was kept in wild mountains, in the summer villa of Patriarch Miron, closely guarded by a special unit of Romanian police. I managed to get to his villa after bribing a Romanian officer, with the help of Rydz's physician, Dr. Cianciara (...) The Marshal spoke with a charming smile, but there was no spark in this smile. He said that after Piłsudski's death, the condition of the army was catastrophic: [...] "The cost of the construction of modest fortifications along our western border was equivalent to an 18-month budget of Poland, and at the same time, we were working on fortifications in the East. A modest armament plan was up to 5 billion zlotys. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? I am not an economist, minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski told me that we only had 180 million (...) We began partial mobilization in the spring 1939. The nation hated it, more than 1000 Silesians deserted to Germany. We were unable to keep Poland mobilized for so long, we could not afford it (...) They say that I am a coward. I had three options: to surrender, to kill myself, and to be captured. It was impossible to fight, as I had only half a company of soldiers with me. To kill myself meant failure. To fly to Warsaw?" ...|$|E
