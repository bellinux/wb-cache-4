5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E
5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.|$|E
5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E

Eventually, the authenticity of models grew and benefits of standardization became more obvious. The most significant and the most basic area of standardization was the model track gauge. At first, certain gauges became de facto standards in hobbyist and manufacturer circles. While the first unofficial standard gauges made interchangeability possible, the rolling stock were still only a rough approximation of the full scale prototype.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Severan Dynasty in 235 the Empire {{entered into}} 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were {{numerous}} putsches by generals who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions - Britain, Spain and North Africa - were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire in the East invaded several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones in}} the stomach region had not been etched by the stomach acid, {{indicating}} this meal {{was less than a}} day old. It is possible that the stomach exit was too narrow to let these remains pass and that the acid was used to extract calcium from the bones, a much-needed nutrient for a young growing animal. The subsequent digestive tract with most extant vertebrates is incapable of further digesting bones. Afterwards the remains would then have been regurgitated. However, the presence of vertebrae in the intestines suggests that the exit was wide and that non-avian theropods in this respect <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> present Lepidosauromorpha than extant Archosauria who regurgitate. This is also confirmed by a high bone content in the coprolites of large theropods. Fish contains much calcium and {{it is possible that the}} hatchling instinctively sought it out; alternatively, it could have been preferentially fed fish by its parents. The presence of skin in the faeces was to be expected as this is not easily digested.|$|E

500|$|Bem, in {{a defense}} of his {{hypothesis}} published {{in the same issue}} of Psychological Review, wrote that in their path analysis Bell et al. engaged in [...] "an unfortunate dichotomization of the dependent variable, sexual orientation ... grouping the bisexual and homosexual respondents into the same category." [...] In his view, while this procedure [...] "might have seemed reasonable on a priori grounds ... it should have been abandoned as soon as the researchers saw the results of their own subanalyses, which {{made it clear that the}} bisexual respondents were not only very different from their exclusively homosexual counterparts but actually <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the heterosexual respondents in theoretically critical ways." [...] Bem argued that by grouping together the bisexuals and homosexuals Bell et al. [...] "reduced many of the correlations and increased the likelihood that important antecedent variables would be erroneously eliminated during the recursive process of discarding the weaker correlates from successive iterations of the path model." ...|$|E

500|$|One critic, Matt Singer of indieWIRE, said in January 2013 {{that he has}} [...] "started to look at January with {{anticipation}} rather than dread." [...] He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have [...] "way too much money riding on [...] {{to be anything but}} mediocre and boring," [...] January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. [...] "Why throw good money after bad?" [...] he asks rhetorically. [...] "Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck." [...] Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to The Devil Inside, [...] "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." [...] He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "controlled demolitions." [...] Cloverfield, he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by The Grey and Mama.|$|E
500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
500|$|There is {{debate about}} when Christianity was first introduced; {{it was no}} later than the 4th century, {{probably}} much earlier. According to Bede, missionaries were sent from Rome by Eleutherius {{at the request of}} the chieftain Lucius of Britain in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea, while others claim through Lucius of Britain. By 410, during the Decline of the Roman Empire, Britain was left exposed by the end of Roman rule in Britain and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars. Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: Patrick (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local [...] "congregations" [...] were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{met with}} Polachek's bandmate of Chairlift, Patrick Wimberly, who collaborated {{with her sister}} Solange Knowles {{at that time and}} went with her on tour. During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> panting. And in my version the synths detuned really quickly for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. It sounds like the whole song melts." ...|$|E
500|$|M.globiceps was {{discovered}} in 1936 and originally classified in its own genus, Neopropithecus. [...] The name globiceps comes from its prominent forehead and derives [...] from the Latin [...] word globus, meaning [...] "ball", and the New Latin suffix -ceps, [...] meaning [...] "head". Like M.pithecoides, {{it was a small}} to medium-sized lemur, weighing approximately [...] and having an intermembral index of 97. [...] It had the most narrow snout and gracile skeleton of the Mesopropithecus species, similar to but smaller than M.pithecoides, making it more like the living sifakas. Its teeth were similar to but larger than those of living sifakas, except for its lower premolars, which were shorter, and the M3 (third upper molar), which was moderately constricted by the cheek and tongue. [...] Its skull length averaged , ranging from [...] It was a mixed feeder, eating fruit, leaves, and a moderate amount of seeds, having a diet {{similar to that of the}} living indri (Indri indri). [...] Although its forelimbs <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> those of living indriids, its hindlimbs and axial skeleton (skull, spine, and ribs) were more specialized for suspension, as in Palaeopropithecus and Babakotia. [...] It was found in the south and west of Madagascar. [...] Three samples of its subfossil remains have been radiocarbon dated, yielding dates of 354–60 BCE, 58–247 CE, and 245–429 CE.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E
