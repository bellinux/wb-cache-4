40|$|Objective: There {{have been}} {{concerns}} about people <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems experiencing {{harassment in the}} Iranian community. This study measures the prevalence and nature of harassment experienced by individuals <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems and compares them with the general population. Methods : Face to face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers to ascertain experiences of harassment. Interviews were carried out with 112 individuals <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems and <b>with</b> 104 individuals from the general population. Results: Sixty-one per cent of people <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems reported experiencing harassment, nearly ten times more frequently {{than those in the}} general population (7 %). Among the people <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems, being female, having higher levels of education, or being unemployed were significantly associated with experiencing harassment. The harassment commonly involved verbal abuse, often made reference to individuals' mental health problems and was primarily committed by family members. Conclusions: A significantly higher prevalence of harassment was reported among individuals <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems living in the community than in the general population sample. Mental health professionals should proactively ask their service users about their experiences at home, and educational interventions are recommended, particularly for families of those <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems...|$|R

5|$|In 1972, Sjumandjaja founded his {{production}} company Matari Film; the company's first film, Si Doel Anak Betawi (Doel the Betawi Child), which he directed, was critically acclaimed {{and led to}} a surge in popularity for both Betawi culture and the film's star Rano Karno. Two of his later films, Si Mamad (The One Called Mamad; 1974) and Pinangan (A Proposal; 1976), were based on the works of Anton Chekov, while the 1975 film Laila Majenun (Laila is Possessed) was an adaptation of West Side Story. After filming Yang Muda Yang Bercinta (The Young Fall in Love), which was delayed by the censorship board, in 1977, he took another hiatus to deal <b>with</b> <b>health</b> issues.

5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together <b>with</b> <b>health</b> programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{describe}} school nurses' experiences working with students <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems. In this inductive qualitative study, {{interviews were conducted with}} 14 school nurses in Sweden. The content analysis revealed three themes: (1) sense of worriedness about working with students <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems, (2) taking care of students <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> issues was an opportunity for personal and professional development, and (3) the experience of making a difference for young people <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems. The school nurses working with students who have mental health problems had to cope with their own emotions, worries, and feelings of insufficiency. However, the school nurses also found the work to be meaningful and rewarding because they appreciated the opportunity for personal and professional development while taking care of students <b>with</b> mental <b>health</b> problems.

Results: Most countries <b>with</b> national <b>health</b> insurance make use of community health clinics organized and staffed {{in a manner similar}} to the U.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down <b>with</b> <b>health</b> problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams was water skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propellor slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line <b>with</b> <b>Health</b> & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we created}} a measure for {{emotional}}ity named the emotional sense of coherence (SOC-E). We found that SOC-E was significantly associated <b>with</b> physical <b>health</b> (r = 0. 266; p < 0. 05), while it was not significantly associated <b>with</b> psychological <b>health</b> (r = 0. 006; NS). Based on a correlation matrix, we constructed a new scale, the SOC-E II, which was even better associated <b>with</b> physical <b>health</b> (r = 0. 362) and also associated <b>with</b> psychological <b>health</b> (r = 0. 259; p < 0. 01). Our results showed that SOC-E and SOC-E II were better predictors of physical health than the SOC scales developed by Aaron Antonovsky (1923 – 1994) (SOC- 29 and SOC- 13). We conclude that emotional coherence is important for physical health, {{but it is not}} important in the same way for psychological health. In a previous study, we found that a mental operationalization of Antonovsky's sense of coherence was highly associated <b>with</b> psychological <b>health</b> and not associated <b>with</b> physical <b>health.</b> Based on these two studies, we conclude that physical health is primarily associated with emotions, while psychological health is primarily associated with mentality...|$|R

5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} <b>with</b> <b>health</b> problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing {{treatment for}} ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
