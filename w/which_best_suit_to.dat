40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} {{application}} of the aspectoriented programming paradigm to runtime adaptation of service compositions can be used to prevent SLA violations. Adaptations are triggered by predicted violations, and are implemented as substitutions of fragments in the service composition.

Before substitution we evaluate fragments with respect to their expected impact on the performance of the composition, and choose those fragments <b>which</b> are <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> prevent a predicted violation.
