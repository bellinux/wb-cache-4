40|$|Intercollegiate {{athletic}} programs are provided for student athletes {{to supplement their}} education. These extracurricular opportunities {{are thought to be}} very important in developing a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>individual.</b> Athletics expose student athletes to competition, team work, goal setting, and other experiences that contribute to being successful in later life (NCAA, 1992). Logically, it seems apparent that these opportunities should be provided equally to men and women participating in intercollegiate athletics since the resulting benefits of athletic participation should be gender neutral. Despite the obvious need for equality, a great disparity still exists in intercollegiate athletics in regard to opportunities provided for men and women (NCAA, 1992). In 1972, Congress took action in attempting to abolish the inequities that existed in educational programs in the United States. Title IX, part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, states: 2 ̆ 2 No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 2 ̆ 2 (Education Amendments of 1972, 1990). Prior to the passage of Title IX, gender discrimination practices could be openly practiced at schools and universities without any fear of recourse for employees or student-athletes (Gordon, 1982). Since the day Title IX became law, considerable debate has been associated with intent and implementation of the law (Jacob, 1993). Most of the problems have centered on the language used in the law and the various interpretations made by various agencies. The agency assigned to provide the standard interpretation for Title IX was the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (Jacob, 1993). The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), part of the HEW, was assigned the responsibility of providing interpretation and determining compliance (Hogan, 1979) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{students}} here today have {{been singled out}} by their schools and selected by Notre Dame because they have demonstrated academic excellence throughout their school years, in addition to demonstrating leadership and service to their communities, church or school,” Vice Chancellor Professor Celia Hammond. Year 12 students from across the State, recognised for their academic ability, leadership and commitment to service, were officially welcomed into the Notre Dame community at the 2012 Early Offer Function held at the University’s Fremantle Campus. Vice Chancellor Professor Celia Hammond and University staff gathered with prospective {{students and their families}} to formally celebrate the achievements of Notre Dame’s early offer recipients. Covering a vast array of courses and disciplines, Notre Dame’s new students were excited to meet and interact with University academics who will play a significant role throughout the duration of their degrees. Gabriella Slattery, a Newman College graduate, will begin her Bachelor of Health and Physical Education degree next year. She said she was attracted to Notre Dame for its personalised approach to education. “I am excited to meet new people and expand my knowledge in Health and Physical Education within Notre Dame’s beautiful surroundings here in Fremantle,” Miss Slattery said. “I chose the course because I have always enjoyed sport and I want to spread this enjoyment to others. ” Michael Collins, a future Law student from John XXIII College, said he was looking forward to experiencing Notre Dame’s “unique atmosphere”. “Everyone that I know who has studied at Notre Dame says it is a great, friendly environment to learn in,” Mr Collins said. “I’d like to see myself as a lawyer, but I’m also thinking of adding on another degree with a possible goal of entering the mining industry. ” The Early Offer Program was introduced by Notre Dame to give secondary schools the opportunity to nominate their students for tertiary studies at the University. Nominations are received from private and government secondary schools throughout Western Australia and New South Wales. “Your schools have nominated you because they can see what you are capable of – not just academically, but as a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>individual</b> in the world today,” Professor Hammond said during the Early Offer Function. “We want to educate you, we want to help you grow and develop – intellectually, socially, emotionally and spiritually.

Comer of Macon, Ga., and Georgia Court of Appeals Judge J. D. Smith of Gainesville, Ga. Given annually, the award goes to worthy individuals whose selfless {{dedication to the}} legal profession and the School of Law merits special recognition. The awards were presented during the Law School Association’s annual breakfast held {{in conjunction with the}} State Bar of Georgia’s Annual Meeting on June 11. Fellow law partner and Georgia Law alumnus Tilman E. Self III presented Comer with his award. Self described Comer as a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>individual</b> dedicated to his family, community and profession. He said the award was “tailor-made for somebody like John Comer” who has “demonstrated on a daily basis how a person should live [his] life and conduct [himself] as a lawyer. ” Upon receiving the award, Comer said he was “deeply honored” and would change only one thing in respect to his ties to the legal profession - being more active in the law school’s alumni association. Comer was born in Macon, but attended Middlesex preparatory school in Concord, Ma. Upon his graduation in 1941, Comer spent the next 42 months serving in the U. S. Army as a first lieutenant in Field Artillery (Pacific Theatre). After the war, he earned his bachelor’s degree at Harvard College and his law degree cum laude at the University of Georgia, where he graduated first in his class in 1949. While at UGA, {{he was a member of}} Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi and Gridiron, and served as editor-in-chief of the student editorial board (which would later publish the Georgia Law Review). After law school, Comer returned to Macon to practice as an associate with the law firm Turpin 2 ̆ 6 Lane. He later associated with Harris, Harris, Russell 2 ̆ 6 Weaver and became a partner at Harris, Russell, Weaver 2 ̆ 6 Watkins. Comer formed the law firm Sell 2 ̆ 6 Comer in 1956 with fellow Georgia Law alumnus Edward S. Sell Jr. and, in 1980, partnered with Melton, McKenna, House 2 ̆ 6 Green to form Sell 2 ̆ 6 Melton. He became of counsel at Sell 2 ̆ 6 Melton in 2002, a position he still holds today. Comer has held multiple leadership positions within the legal profession and has served as president of the Macon Bar Association (1956), the Macon Legal Aid Society (1953) and the Georgia Academy of Hospital Attorneys (1985). In addition, he has been a recipient of the Macon Bar Association’s Lawyer of the Year Award (1954) and has earned a listing in the Best Lawyers of America. Comer has been active in civic service by presiding over the United Givers Fund of Macon, the Macon Chapter of the American Red Cross, Macon Civic Club and the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce as well as serving as a trustee with several religious and education organizations. Comer and his wife, Mary, have a son and daughter as well as two grandchildren. Professor Emeritus R. Perry Sentell Jr. presented Smith with his award. Sentell called Smith a “paragon of character and integrity. ” Sentell said, as evidenced by their nominations, Smith’s colleagues also hold him in high esteem, regarding him as “the kindest, most thoughtful [and] most helpful judge on the bench. ” After receiving the Distinguished Service Scroll Award, Smith acknowledged Sentell as one of the most inspirational people in his life, stating that “having this award presented to me by Professor Sentell is as much of an honor as the award itself. ” He also reminded alumni of the great value of their associations with the law school and the friendships they formed there. Born in Hall County, Smith was educated in the Hall County school system at both the primary and secondary levels. He graduated with honors from the University of Florida in 1968, earning his Bachelor of Arts in Economics. Then, he obtained his Juris Doctor from UGA in 1972. While at Georgia, Smith served as associate editor of the Georgia Law Review and was named to the Dean’s List. Following law school, he served as a law assistant to Justice William B. Gunter of the Supreme Court of Georgia before beginning private law practice. While practicing law, Smith earned a Master of Laws in Taxation from Emory University. While serving as an appellate judge, he earned a Master of Laws in Judicial Process from the University of Virginia. Gov. Zell Miller appointed Smith to the Georgia Court of Appeals in 1993. Smith currently serves as presiding judge and is the court’s immediate past chief judge. Previously, he was a Superior Court judge for over eight years and served as chief judge of the Northeastern Judicial Circuit. Smith is a member and past president of the Gainesville-Northeastern Circuit Bar Association and a member of the Atlanta Bar Association, the State Bar of Georgia and the American Bar Association. He currently serves as president of the Joseph Henry Lumpkin American Inn of Court and is a member of the law school’s Board of Visitors. Smith is the former chairman of the Chestatee Regional Library Board and former director of the Gainesville Kiwanis Club, which presented him with its “Workhorse Award” in 1978. In addition, he served as chairman of the Troop Committee of Gainesville’s Boy Scout Troop 16. He and his wife, Flo, have two adult children, Brian and Joanna.

We will explore an under addressed aspect of giftedness, namely the role of interdisciplinary activities and problems to foster talent in and across the disciplines of mathematics, science and humanities, increasingly important for emerging professions in the 21 st century. Examples from the history of mathematics, science and arts will be used to argue for the value of such activities to foster polymathic traits in gifted individuals, particularly the questioning of paradigms. Recent findings from classroom studies will be used to illustrate the value of such an approach to gifted education...|$|R
