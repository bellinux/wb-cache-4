[...] Expert on Russia Paul Joyal suggested that [...] "A message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin....

500|$|For {{this version}} {{he also made}} changes to the Emir's letter to Tintin; the former version had been formal in its prose, stating [...] "Most esteemed and well-beloved friend, I entrust to you my son Abdullah, to improve his English. Here the {{situation}} is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah". In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>you</b> with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, Anonymous {{announced}} a major, sustained operation against ISIS following the November 2015 Paris attacks, declaring, [...] "Anonymous {{from all over}} the world will hunt you down. You should know that we <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>you</b> and we will not let you go." [...] ISIS responded on Telegram by calling them [...] "idiots", and asking [...] "What they [...] hack?" [...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

2500|$|Is and Always Was was {{released}} on October 6, 2009, on Eternal Yip Eye Music. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matt Groening had chosen Johnston to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in May 2010, in Minehead, England. Later that year, he was invited by rock band Cage the Elephant to appear at Starry Nights Fest, a music festival in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Johnston performed a brief solo set before being joined on stage by Cage, who backed performances of several songs, including [...] "Speeding Motorcycle" [...] and [...] "True Love <b>Will</b> <b>Find</b> <b>You</b> in the End". Also that year, Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi, How Are You. The game is similar to Frogger, but features Johnston's art and music. It is said Daniel Johnston played it during its development and liked it, although he was not familiar with the iPhone.|$|E
2500|$|The drink Slusho! {{served as}} part of the viral {{marketing}} campaign. The drink had already appeared in producer Abrams' previous creation, the TV series Alias. Websites for Slusho! and Taguruato were launched to add to the mythology of Cloverfield. The Japanese phone number in the Tagruato website did work, but only played recorded messages. For example, one of the messages was: [...] "Thank you for calling Tagruato. Due to high call volumes, your call has been transferred to an automated answering service. There are no updates at this time. After the tone, please leave a message, and one of our associates <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>you</b> as soon as possible". A building bearing the company logo for Tagruato can also be seen in the TV spot of the 2009 Star Trek film, and Uhura orders a Slusho! during the bar scene. When Cloverfield was hosted at Comic-Con 2007, gray Slusho! T-shirts were distributed to attendees. Fans who had registered at the Slusho! website received e-mails of fictional sonar images before the film's release that showed a deep-sea creature heading toward Manhattan. Fans who ordered merchandise received pieces of torn Tagruato documents and Japanese newspapers along with their products. Slusho! has also appeared in Fringe and Heroes.|$|E
