5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a hangover the next day just minutes {{before the start of}} play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse. When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 despite his hangover.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|Miller was rested for {{the match}} against Derbyshire {{immediately}} after the First Test, a rain-affected match that ended in a draw. Australia then travelled to Bramall Lane in Sheffield under the captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Arthur Morris were rested from the match and stayed in London with the team manager. Miller bowled only one over after Yorkshire won the toss due to his sore rib. Nevertheless, after the first day's play, he organised a party for his young team that lasted until the next afternoonthe rest day. Miller and Lindwall, the two most senior players present, were the last to leave. They <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a hangover {{on the following day}} just minutes before play was to start in front of a packed stadium of 30,000. With no transport available, a journalist hired a hearse from a nearby funeral home to transport the pacemen to the ground. They arrived just in time and Yorkshire went on to finish at 377, Lindwall taking four of the last five wickets despite his hangover. When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller rearranged his batting order to allow him more time to recover. As a result, with regular opener Colin McDonald absent hurt, Ian Craig and wicket-keeper Don Tallon opened the batting, but both were dismissed cheaply, for 19 and a duck respectively. However, Graeme Hole (71) and Harvey (69) consolidated the innings, and Miller came in at 3/128 and was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 from 195 minutes despite his hangover. He had been dropped five times during his innings, which helped Australia to avoid the follow on and end at 323. Having taken a 54-run first innings lead, Yorkshire reached 3/220 in their second innings and the match was drawn. Miller injury had improved and he took 0/40 in the second innings from 15 overs.|$|E

500|$|Once {{illustrations}} {{were approved}} for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition {{to be published}} about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with {{the replacement of the}} frontispiece (The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water) in colour and the addition of new colour plates: Rivendell, Bilbo <b>Woke</b> <b>Up</b> <b>with</b> the Early Sun in His Eyes, Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves and a Conversation with Smaug, which features a dwarvish curse written in Tolkien's invented script Tengwar, and signed with two [...] "þ" [...] ("Th") runes. The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of Bilbo <b>Woke</b> <b>Up</b> <b>with</b> the Early Sun in His Eyes.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, Z-100 radio {{personality}} Dan Clark and musician Roger Sause wrote a song, [...] "I <b>Woke</b> <b>Up</b> <b>with</b> a Tom Peterson Haircut", {{which featured}} a singing part for Peterson.

500|$|On {{the day of}} {{the final}} Terry <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a virus which {{affected}} his balance. Although he passed a fitness test in the morning, Ranieri decided to start him on the bench, to which the defender later reflected: [...] "It was a tough decision but he did what he felt was right. It seems like somebody up there doesn't like me." [...] The teamsheets showed Gallas partnering Marcel Desailly in central defence, and Hasselbaink starting up front for Chelsea. Wright was named on the bench for Arsenal and Ray Parlour was positioned alongside Vieira in central midfield. Both teams lined up in a 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards.|$|E
500|$|... "Snake Charmer", {{initially}} titled [...] "Genesis," [...] as {{a reference}} to the Book of Genesis, is based on the Biblical story of Adam and Eve. It pre-dates the band’s reunion, and was a guitar riff DeLonge kept around to expand upon in the future. The song's coda was composed by Barker and engineer Chris Holmes. Hoppus composed two versions of [...] "Heart's All Gone", one fast and one slow, and ended up liking both, so the slower version serves as an interlude on the album's deluxe edition. [...] "Wishing Well" [...] was solely created by DeLonge, and is what Hoppus describes as the epitome of the album: [...] "It's very catchy, but the lyrics are really, really dark and a little depressing." [...] "Kaleidoscope" [...] arose when Hoppus <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the song's opening lyrics in his head, which he expanded into a Descendents-ish classic punk song. [...] "The mentality behind it is being a slacker in 2011," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "The 20s and 30s malaise that is America right now." [...] It was also inspired by the album's lengthy recording process and the transformation of the band. [...] "This Is Home" [...] was originally titled [...] "Scars to Blame", but changed considerably when Hoppus took the chorus and bridge and combined it with new lyrics written by DeLonge, morphing it into what he described as [...] "an anthem for youthful abandon." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Torres {{began the}} season as a backup outfielder again. On April 25, he {{replaced}} Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's return on May 1. Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a reserve role until May 9, {{when he became a}} starting outfielder {{for the rest of the}} season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist. On May 30, he had a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning against Carlos Rosa to give the Giants a 65 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. By midseason, he had replaced Rowand as the Giants' everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter. After the Giants blew a 92 lead over the Florida Marlins on July 28, Torres had a game-ending single in the 10th inning against Clay Hensley to give the Giants a 109 win. After the Giants blew a 73 lead on August 12, Torres had a game-ending RBI single against Andrew Cashner in the ninth inning to give the Giants an 87 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On the morning of September 12, Torres <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent an appendectomy the same day. He returned to the lineup roughly two weeks later, and on October 1 it was announced that he had won the 2010 Willie Mac Award. Torres said upon receiving the award, [...] "It's the best. It's an honor for me from my teammates. I've been blessed and I'm happy and just thank God for everything, putting me here and these guys treating me like a family." [...] In 139 games (507 at bats), Torres hit [...]268 with 84 runs scored, 136 hits, 16 home runs, and 63 RBI. He ranked fourth in the NL in doubles (43, behind Jayson Werth's 46 and Matt Holliday's and Ryan Braun's 45) and ranked seventh in the NL in triples (eight). He finished the year having led the Giants in stolen bases with 26.|$|E

An explicit comparison with Le Pen was made by Ad Melkert, then lijsttrekker of the Labour Party, who said in Emmen on 24 April 2002: [...] "If you flirt with Fortuyn, then in the Netherlands the same thing will happen as happened in France. There they <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Le Pen, soon we will wake up with Fortuyn." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group left Epic {{after the}} disappointing sales of Busted [...] {{to sign with}} Warner Bros. Records. In 1994 the band {{released}} <b>Woke</b> <b>Up</b> <b>With</b> A Monster, which was produced by producer Ted Templeman, {{best known for his}} work with Van Halen. The album's title track was issued as the first single and reached No.16 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. The album's sales were poor, and it peaked at only No.123. By the time the album came out, there had been a variety of significant changes in the band, both music-wise and appearance-wise. The style of music is more on the [...] "hard rock" [...] side, their [...] "heaviest" [...] album since One On One. Ted Templeman's heavy-handed production was also the subject of much criticism. Rick Nielsen grew a goatee, and Robin Zander's voice grew noticeably deeper. The band also contributed a cover of John Lennon's song [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] on the [...] album.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, {{making her}} {{perhaps the first}} woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11+ grade. The route is rated 5.11a and is [...] of climbing. It is a famous {{formation}} in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as [...] "the cleanest possible style". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has {{said in an interview that}} while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming.|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
