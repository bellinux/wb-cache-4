5|$|Although the RF-4M {{would have}} had some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as the cost <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> launched by a Titan II rocket, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> small, and there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a caudal keel present {{on either side}} of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated.

5|$|As a hadrosaurid, Prosaurolophus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a large herbivore, eating {{plants with}} a {{sophisticated}} skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing.
