40|$|Embedded {{environment}} imposes severe {{constraints of}} system resources on embedded applications. Performance, memory footprint, and power consumption are critical factors for embedded applications. Meanwhile, {{the data in}} embedded applications demonstrate unique properties. More specifically, <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> data are data representable in considerably fewer bits than in one word, which nevertheless occupy an entire register or memory word and streaming data are the input data processed by an application sequentially, which stay in the system for a short duration and thus exhibit little data locality. <b>Narrow</b> <b>width</b> and streaming data affect the efficiency of register, cache, and memory and {{must be taken into}} account when optimizing for performance, memory footprint, and power consumption. This dissertation proposes methods to efficiently handle <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> and streaming data in embedded applications. Quantitative measurements of <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> and streaming data are performed to provide guidance for optimizations. Novel architectural features and associated compiler algorithms are developed. To efficiently handle <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> data in registers, two register allocation schemes are proposed for the ARM processor to allocate two <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> variables to one register. A static scheme exploits maximum bitwidth. A speculative scheme further exploits dynamic bitwidth. Both result in reduced spill cost and performance improvement. To efficiently handle <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> data in memory, a memory layout method is proposed to coalesce multiple <b>narrow</b> <b>width</b> data in one memory location in a DSP processor, leading to fewer explicit address calculations. This method improves performance and shrinks memory footprint.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the HI absorption in a sample of 101 flux-selected radio AGN (S_ 1. 4 GHz > 50 mJy) observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). HI absorption is detected in 32 galaxies, showing a broad variety of widths, shapes and kinematical properties. We characterize the HI spectra of the individual detections using the busy function (Westmeier et al. 2014). With the goal of identifying different morphological structures of HI, we study the kinematical and radio source properties of the detections as function of their <b>width.</b> <b>Narrow</b> lines (FWHM = 500 km/s). These detections are good candidates for being HI outflows. The detection rate of HI outflows is 5 percent in the total radio AGN sample. This fraction represents a lower limit, however it could suggests that, if outflows are a characteristic phenomenon of all radio sources, they would have a short depletion timescale compared to the lifetime of the AGN. Blueshifted and broad/asymmetric lines are more often present among young, compact sources, suggesting that in these AGN the HI is likely to be unsettled. This may arise due to jet-cloud interactions, as young radio sources clear their way through the rich ambient gaseous medium. Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} separate channels for detection of first-order luminance modulations (LM) and second-order modulations of the local amplitude (AM) of a texture. Mixtures of LM and AM with different phase relationships appear very different: in-phase compounds (LM + AM) look like 3 -D corrugated surfaces, while out-of-phase compounds (LM - AM) appear flat and/or transparent. This difference may arise because the in-phase compounds are consistent with multiplicative shading, while the out-of-phase compounds are not. We investigated the role of these modulation components in surface depth perception. We used a textured background with thin bars formed by local changes in luminance and/or texture amplitude. These stimuli appear as embossed surfaces with wide and narrow regions. Keeping the AM modulation depth fixed at a suprathreshold level, we determined the amount of luminance contrast required for observers to correctly indicate the <b>width</b> (<b>narrow</b> or wide) of 'raised' regions in the display. Performance (compared to the LM-only case) was facilitated {{by the presence of}} AM, but, unexpectedly, performance for LM - AM was as good as for LM + AM.

40|$|Analysis {{results from}} ASCA and ROSAT {{observations}} of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 766 are reported. In the ASCA observation we observed rapid variability with a doubling time scale of 1000 seconds. A spectral variability event was observed in which the spectrum softened and hardened above and below ~ 1 keV, respectively, as the flux increased. The spectra could be modeled with 5 components: a power law, warm absorber, iron K(alpha) line and soft excess component flux. The spectral variability resulted from a highly {{significant change in the}} intrinsic photon law index from Gamma ~ 1. 6 to ~ 2. 0, an increase in the warm absorber ionization, and a marginally significant decrease in the soft component normalization. A ~ 100 eV equivalent <b>width</b> <b>narrow</b> iron K(alpha) line was detected in the high state spectrum. Spectral hardening during flux increases was observed in three ROSAT observations. The change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excess component in the ASCA spectra can be explained as a transition from a first order pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a sudden increase in the injected electron Lorentz factor. The change in the ionization of the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increase in flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. The ROSAT spectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power law and a relatively nonvarying soft component possibly primary disk emission. These results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore an {{evolutionary}} Unified scenario involving super massive black hole (SMBH) and starburst (SB) with outflow, that seems capable of explaining most of the observational properties –of at least part – of AGNs Our suggestion is explored inside {{the expectations of the}} Starburst model close associated with the AGN where the narrow line region (NLR), broad line region (BLR) and broad absorption line (BAL) region are produced in part by the outflow process with shells and in compact supernova remnants (cSNR). The outflow process in BAL QSOs with extreme IR and Feii emission is studied. In addition, the Feii Problem regarding the BLR of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is analysed. Neither the correlations between the BAL, IR emission, Feii intensity and the intrinsic properties of the AGN are clearly understood. We suggest here that the behaviour of the BAL, IR and Feii emission in AGNs can be understood inside an evolutionary and composite model for AGNs. In our model, strong BAL systems and Feii emission are present (and intense) in young IR objects.

It has also been shown that LM and AM mixtures with different phase relationships are easily separated in identification tasks, and (informally) appear very different with the in-phase compound (LM + AM), producing the most realistic depth percept. We investigated the role of these LM and AM components in depth perception. Stimuli consisted of a noise texture background with thin bars formed as local increments or decrements in luminance and/or noise amplitude. These stimuli appear as embossed surfaces with wide and narrow regions. When luminance and amplitude changes have the same sign and magnitude (LM + AM) the overall modulation is consistent with multiplicative shading, but this is not so when the two modulations have opposite sign (LM - AM). Keeping the AM modulation depth fixed at a suprathreshold level, we determined the amount of luminance contrast required for observers to correctly indicate the <b>width</b> (<b>narrow</b> or wide) of raised regions in the display. Performance (compared to the LM-only case) was facilitated by the presence of AM, but, unexpectedly, performance for LM - AM was even better than for LM + AM. Further tests suggested that this improvement in performance is not due to an increase in the detectability of luminance in the compound stimuli. Thus, contrary to previous findings, these results suggest the possibility of interaction between first-order and second-order mechanisms in depth perception...|$|E

This study measured the effect of variations in cerebral blood flow on ultrasonic heating of the cerebral cortex of anaesthetised, neonatal pigs. Wide and narrow ultrasound beams were used. Pulsed ultrasound exposures were delivered in 90 s bursts at 5. 8 micros pulse length, pulse repetition frequency 8 kHz and centre frequency 3. 5 MHz. Studies were performed with the target at {{the focus of a}} fixed, stationary beam of 0. 3 cm - 6 dB beam <b>width</b> (<b>narrow</b> beam) and I(spta) 1. 4 W/cm(2) (n = 11), or with the target in the near field of a fixed, stationary beam of 1. 6 cm - 6 dB beam width (wide beam) and I(spta) 3. 6 W/cm(2) (n = 5). The 90 s ultrasound exposures were performed under three different conditions of ambient cerebral blood flow: baseline (during normocarbic, normoxic conditions), increased (during hypercarbic, hypoxic conditions) and absent (postmortem). Cerebral blood flow was measured using the radiolabelled microsphere technique.
