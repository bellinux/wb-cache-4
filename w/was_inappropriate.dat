5|$|On October 11, 1945 Justice LeBel issued {{his report}} that {{essentially}} exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate.</b>|$|E
5|$|As an {{intoxicated}} Holly displays erratic {{behavior at}} Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is dismayed by {{her lack of}} irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her behavior <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate,</b> Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that {{she will not be}} attending the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|In September 2004, Monster paid $6 {{million in}} an {{agreement}} with the San Francisco 49ers and the city of San Francisco to rename the football team's home stadium from Candlestick Park to Monster Park for four years. $3 million of it was given to the football team and the other $3 million to the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. Critics of local politician Matt Gonzales said it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the city to sell the name of a public facility to a corporation and a ballot was passed ensuring that the name of the park reverted to Candlestick Park in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} politics, Southey {{believed}} that {{war with the}} post-revolution France <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed {{to the government of}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The poem is also heavily grounded in Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes an earlier version of his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans to travel from Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E

5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
5|$|When Sabrina {{reached her}} teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife {{experiment}} had failed {{and he should}} send her away, as it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for Day {{to live with her}} unchaperoned. He then arranged for Sabrina to undergo experimental vocational and residential changes—first attending a boarding school, then becoming an apprentice to a dressmaker family, and eventually being employed as Day's housekeeper. Having seen changes in Sabrina, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called this off when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a lady's companion.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{video game}} , {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released for the PlayStation 3 video game console, features combat scenes {{that take place}} within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England set in an alternate history. It was released on 23 March 2007 in the United Kingdom. The use of images of the cathedral caused controversy {{with the leaders of}} the Church of England, which claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> of Sony to allow players to fire guns in a city with a gun problem. They have made several legal threats against Sony. They intended to make several demands of Sony, including an apology, a substantial donation, complete withdrawal of the game or modifying the segment featuring the interior of the cathedral, and financial support of Manchester groups trying to reduce gun crime in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, {{who sought to}} tell a comedic story based on horror film and B-movie clichés. They mapped out the project as a paper-and-pencil game before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on command lines, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed Maniac Mansions simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a game engine called SCUMM, which was used in many later LucasArts titles. After its release, Maniac Mansion was ported to several platforms. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System had to be reworked heavily, in response to complaints by Nintendo of America that the game <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for children.|$|E

Problems of professionalism and the clinical relationship to AA emerged. Clinical interventions <b>are</b> <b>inappropriate</b> in the AA context, but sociologists may adopt the ethnographer 2 ̆ 7 s role. Exploration of the transcultural adaptation of AA ideas for an Hispanic population proved therapeutic when clients were placed in roles such as collaborator and cultural informant.

5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate.</b> Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate.</b> Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E

5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Marshall {{departed}} for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured {{himself in a}} Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson. No known copies of the pamphlet are extant, and related surviving documents do not relate {{the exact nature of}} the charges. Marshall, being out of the state, was unable to reply immediately to the charges, and his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, that the authors had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate.</b> On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 168. Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.|$|E
