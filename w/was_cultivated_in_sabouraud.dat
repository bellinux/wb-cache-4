40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the types of dermatophytes and dermatophytosis in Elazığ region to provide appropriate information for therapy planning and public health prevention. Methods: A total of 652 patients who attending to outpatient clinic between June 2007 – May 2008 with clinical signs of dermatophytosis were included in this study. All samples, including with negative results on direct microscopy <b>were</b> <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Sabouraud</b> dextrose agar (Oxoid), mycobiotic agar (Acumedia) and potato dextrose agar (Oxoid). Results: Dermatophytes were isolated in 142 (21. 8 %) out of all samples. Of the isolates 70. 4 % were Trichophyton rubrum, 15. 4 % were Trichophyton mentagrophytes, 4. 2 % were, 4. 2 % were Microsporum canis, 2. 8 % were Epidermophyton floccosum, 2. 11 % were Trichophyton violaceum, 0. 7 % were Trichophyton tonsurans. Conclusion: Trichophyton rubrum was most frequently isolated dermatophytosis agent in Elazığ region...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{herbal tea}} {{is one of}} the most common hot {{beverages}} in the world. Tea poisoning as a result of saprophytic fungus contamination can cause many different diseases among human. This research was aimed at defining saprophytic fungus contamination rate of all kinds of tea which are being consumed in Babol, northern Iran. Materials and Methods: This research was carried out on 100 samples of tea using descriptive – analytical method. The samples were gathered from different regions of the city including both homes and shops. The properties of tea are registered in a table. To define the level of the contamination, 20 pieces of each tea sample <b>were</b> <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Sabouraud</b> Dextrose Agar (S) fields The grown fungus around tea pieces were recognized by an ordinary laboratory method, during daily observations of plates. The rate of contamination was measured based on the total amount of colony per 100 mg of dry tea leaves. (P Value ≤ 0 / 05). Results: All of the 100 <b>cultivated</b> tea samples <b>were</b> contaminated. The samples were classified into three groups of packed, unpacked and bagged tea, respectively. The maximum contamination rate was seen in bagged group. Statistical differences between groups were significant. (P< 0. 001 (The most identified fungus were as follow: Aspergillus Niger, penisillium A. flavus, Mucur spp. Among tea samples which were collected from homes and shops, home samples were more polluted than shop samples, but there was not any significant difference (P= 0. 33). The unpacked tea samples were less polluted than firm packed tea samples but the difference was not significant (P= 0. 27). Conclusion: The result of this study indicates that the consuming tea in Babol is highly contaminated by saprophytic fungus which can be a serious threat because of the popularity of tea as a hot beverage. And so an accurate control over all various steps of harvesting, processing and distributing of tea is necessary and recommended...|$|R
40|$|Intestines are colonized by microorganisms, which vary {{according}} to the species and the intestinal region. Thus, due the lack of information about this subject in literature, this research was developed for better knowing some aspects of the intestinal microbiology of the agouti, considered one of the biggest Brazilian wild rodents. Three males and three not pregnant adult females, belonging to the Catanduva City Zoo, SP, went through laparotomy after anesthesia. Samples were collected with sterile swab in the medium thirds of the jejune, cecum and greater colon after enterotomy. They <b>were</b> <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Sabouraud</b> agar and <b>in</b> TSA (triptone-soy agar). In the jejune, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was of 83. 33 %, Salmonella spp. of 66. 67 % and Clostridium spp. of 50. 00 % of the samples. In the cecum, they were identified Staphylococcus aureus in 33. 33 %, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. in 100 % and Streptococcus spp. in 16. 67 % of the samples were identified. In the greater colon, the growth of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium spp. in 66. 67 %, Staphylococcus aureus in 83. 33 %, and Streptococcus spp. in 16. 67 % of the samples was observed, showing the occurrence of variations in the bacteriae proportion according to the intestinal region.   KEY WORDS: Dasyprocta azarae, intestines, microbiote. Os intestinos são colonizados por microorganismos, variáveis de acordo com a espécie e região intestinal. Assim, em virtude da ausência de informações sobre esse assunto na literatura, esta pesquisa foi desenvolvida para melhor se conhecer alguns aspectos da microbiota intestinal da cutia, um dos maiores roedores selvagens brasileiros. Três machos e três fêmeas adultas vazias, pertencentes ao Zoológico Municipal de Catanduva, SP, foram submetidos a laparotomia mediante anestesia. Amostras com swab estéril foram coletadas nos terços médios do jejuno, ceco e cólon maior, após enterotomia, sendo semeadas em ágar- Sabouraud e em ágar-triptona-soja (TSA). No jejuno, houve o crescimento de Staphylococcus aureus e Escherichia coli em 83, 33 %, Salmonella spp. em 66, 67 % e Clostridium spp. em 50, 00 % das amostras. No ceco, identificaram-se Staphylococcus aureus em 33, 33 %, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. e Clostridium spp. em 100 % e Streptococcus spp.   em 16, 67 % das amostras. No cólon maior, houve o crescimento de Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli e Clostridium spp. em 66, 67 %, Staphylococcus aureus em 83, 33 %, e Streptococcus spp. em 16, 67 % das amostras, mostrando a ocorrência de variações na proporção bacteriana de acordo com a região intestinal.

40|$|Candida albicans {{produced}} a karatinolytic proteinase (KPase) or C. albicans producing proteinase (CAPP), a proposed new term for this enzyme, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes also produced KPase when <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> liquid medium containing human stratum corneum (HSC) as the nitrogen source, but {{were unable to}} do so when <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> <b>sabouraud</b> dextrose broth. Purified KPase from the culture supernatants of C. albicans had a molecular weight of 42, 000 and an optimum pH at 4. 0. The KPase was found to belong to the carboxyl proteinases group and its activity was strongly inhibited by pepstatin. Both fungi were able to grow by secreting KPase which digested HSC for nutrients. KPase from both fungi had high activity in each optimum pH, such as weakly acidic pH on C. albicans and neutral pH on T. mentagrophytes to adapt their surrounding environment by changing the environmental pH into their own optimum pH...|$|R
