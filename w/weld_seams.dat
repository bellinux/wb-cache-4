XJ coupés finally started to emerge from Jaguar show-rooms only some two years later. The coupé was based on the short-wheelbase version of the XJ. The coupé's elongated doors were made out of a lengthened standard XJ front door (the <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are clearly visible under the interior panels where two front door shells were grafted together with a single outer skin). A few XJ-Cs were modified by Lynx Cars and Avon into convertibles with a retractable canvas top, but this was not a factory product. Lynx conversions (16 in total) did benefit of powered tops. Both six and twelve-cylinder models were offered, 6,505 of the former and 1,873 of the latter. Even with the delay, these cars suffered from water leaks and wind noise. The delayed introduction, the labour-intensive work required by the modified saloon body, the higher price than the four-door car, and the early demise promulgated by the new XJ-S, all ensured a small production run.|$|E

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength. These correlations exist only when top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having non uniform <b>seam</b> boundary. However, <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength.

The pressure-containing {{shell of the}} heat exchanger burst at its <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> expelling a large volume of very hot hydrogen and naphtha, which spontaneously ignited upon contact with the surrounding air. The ensuing explosion was so violent that many in Anacortes felt the shock wave across Fidalgo Bay.

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|E
50|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to realise high purity results, orbital welding found {{its place in the}} {{production}} of clean-room components for the semiconductor industry. Its application has now expanded to the construction of pipework and equipment for diverse industries like food processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, automotive engineering, biotechnology, shipbuilding and aerospace. Automated orbital TIG welding is also used in the construction of power stations, (thermal power plants). The construction materials used must be able to withstand the enormous mechanical loads produced by the high pressures and temperatures created by the media carried in the tubes. Notches, pores and inclusions in the <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> must be avoided at all costs, as these create weak points that can lead to subsequent formation of cracks. These in turn can have serious consequences in terms of component failure. This means that tubes are often made from nickel-based materials with walls up to 200mm thick. One manufacturer has developed an orbital narrow gap welding system with hot-wire feed specifically for this purpose, which uses running gear that moves on a guide ring fixed around the tube. This new variant has created {{a lot of interest in}} the sector, with the worldwide boom in power station construction fueling the never-ending search for increasingly productive manufacturing methods using new types of high-temperature steels.|$|E

The orientation of the polymer chains in the welds, {{which is the result}} of melting and reaystallization, was quantified by IR microscopy for the first time: In the injection molded plates the chains were oriented along machine direction (MD), whereas this pattern changed to normal direction (ND) at the <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> Two positions at the welds were inspected to study the orientation of the chains: In one of these the PLM image depicts two well defined <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> while at the other, the <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> were absent.

40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} weld seam integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the weld seam integrity indicator and thus to improved weld seam properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal weld seam is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the weld seam indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to weld seam formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that weld seam formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> associated with low values of the weld seam integrity indicator. Through further elaboration of the concepts presented in this work, the weld seam integrity indicator is to be developed, with the future aim of predicting the weld seam performance through finite element simulations. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPresshardened {{steel is}} used in {{nowadays}} automotive production. Due to its high strength, sheet thicknesses can be reduced which results in decreasing weight of car body components. However, because of microstructure softening and coating agglomerations in the seam, welding is still a challenge. In this paper laser beam welding of 22 MnB 5 with varying energy input per irradiated area is presented. It is found that increasing energy input per seam length reduces tensile strength. Using a small spot size of 200 μm, tensile strength of 1434 N/mm 2 can be reached in bead on plate welds. In lap welds tensile strength is limited because of coating particles agglomerating at the melt pool border line. However, the resulting strength is higher when using several small <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> than using one seam with the same total seam width.

Many studies have been conducted to search the optimal welding condition experimentally that ensure the joining quality of laser welding that relies both on welding system configuration and welding parameter specification. Both non-destructive and destructive techniques, for example, ultrasonic inspection and tensile test are widely used in practice for estimating the joining quality. Non-destructive techniques are attractive as a rapid quality testing method despite relatively low accuracy.

With the developed scanning structures, a near-homogeneous temperature distribution was generated over the width of the weld seam for curved <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> which is not possible by welding with a homogenized laser radiation intensity distribution...|$|E

Original {{position}} statistic distribution analysis (OPA) {{technique is}} {{a new kind of}} analysis method {{that can be used to}} detect the segregation, porosity and non-metal inclusion of iron and steel material. In the present paper, the technique has been applied to analyze two middle and low alloy welding plate samples. One sample is normal and there is no any defect in its <b>welding</b> <b>seam,</b> whereas the other sample has one obvious little defect in its <b>welding</b> <b>seam.</b> For each sample, both the <b>welding</b> <b>seam</b> and the mother material were scanned and analyzed, and the continuous content distribution of each element in scan area was thus accurately obtained. From the content distribution map, the weld shape and the transition zone were directly observed. By using the content curve from mother material to the <b>welding</b> <b>seam,</b> the content change range and its change gradient were calculated. These two parameters were suggested to evaluate the quality of the <b>welding</b> <b>seam</b> and the <b>welding</b> technology. For the sample with the little defect, in its defect region the contents of C and S presented higher, whereas the contents of metal elements such as Ni, Cr, Mn, Mo, Al presented lower. This result gave the reason why its mechanics property was relatively bad. It was suggested that the defect completely resulted from another kind of material. ...|$|R
