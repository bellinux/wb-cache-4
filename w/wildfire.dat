5|$|The role of <b>wildfire</b> is an {{important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a <b>wildfire.</b> Regions of the park that have experienced <b>wildfire</b> in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of <b>wildfire</b> had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on <b>wildfire</b> and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post <b>wildfire</b> regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role <b>wildfire</b> plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for <b>wildfire</b> management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|Many {{houses are}} at risk of being {{destroyed}} by <b>wildfires.</b> While previous studies have improved our understanding of how, when and why houses are destroyed by <b>wildfires,</b> little attention has been given to how these fires started. We compiled a dataset of <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses in New South Wales and Victoria and, by comparing against <b>wildfires</b> where no houses were destroyed, investigated the relationship between the distribution of ignition causes for <b>wildfires</b> that did and did not destroy houses. Powerlines, lightning and deliberate ignitions are the main causes of <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses. Powerlines were 6 times more common in the <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses data than in the <b>wildfires</b> where no houses were destroyed data and lightning was 2 times more common. For deliberate- and powerline-caused <b>wildfires,</b> temperature, wind speed, and forest fire danger index were all significantly higher and relative humidity significantly lower (P < 0. 05) on the day of ignition for <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses compared with <b>wildfires</b> where no houses were destroyed. For all powerline-caused <b>wildfires</b> the first house destroyed always occurred on the day of ignition. In contrast, the first house destroyed was after the day of ignition for 78 % of lightning-caused <b>wildfires.</b> Lightning-caused <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses were significantly larger (P < 0. 001) in area than human-caused <b>wildfires</b> that destroyed houses. Our results suggest that targeting fire prevention strategies around ignition causes, such as improving powerline safety and targeted arson reduction programmes, and reducing fire spread may decrease the number of <b>wildfires</b> that destroy houses...|$|R
5000|$|The NCFS uses a {{database}} {{referred to as}} [...] "signal 14" [...] to monitor the daily fire activity {{in the state of}} North Carolina. The data contained within the signal 14 database is an estimation of the occurrence of <b>wildfires</b> throughout the state, with the exception of <b>wildfires</b> located on federal property. For instance, signal 14 statistics indicate approximately 1,252 <b>wildfires</b> occurred between January and April 2012, of which 45 occurred in April. The NCFS tracks <b>wildfires</b> in order to map out areas where <b>wildfires</b> occur and assess which areas are more prone to the development of <b>wildfires.</b> In terms of mapping <b>wildfires,</b> North Carolina is divided into twelve districts and each one contributes daily counts of any <b>wildfires</b> to the signal 14 database. Thereby, assisting the NCFS in determining the vulnerability, of each district, to <b>wildfires.</b>|$|R

5|$|A <b>wildfire</b> or {{wildland}} fire is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a <b>wildfire</b> can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfireâ€™s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|After Cersei {{fails to}} appear, Lancel Lannister {{is sent to}} {{retrieve}} her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a <b>wildfire</b> cache about to explode. He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The <b>wildfire</b> ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by jumping out a window.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wildfire</b> {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States <b>wildfire</b> operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E

5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a <b>wildfire</b> {{occurred}} in 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger {{that needed to be}} suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize <b>wildfire</b> suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands.|$|E

5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or <b>wildfire,</b> there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following <b>wildfire</b> concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Forest fires {{seasonally}} {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism. The Summer of Fire saw more resources {{dedicated to the}} subject of <b>wildfire</b> than ever before or since in the United States. The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E

50|$|Like {{with most}} natural {{disasters}} and emergency situations, being prepared {{is crucial to}} saving life and property. <b>Wildfires</b> are a natural process of the forest and are ecological beneficial to forests and wildland areas. However, <b>wildfires</b> become a problem when they begin to move to areas that are populated with people. This generally happens in areas that have settlements and other built environments interacting with natural woodland areas or areas that have potential fuel for <b>wildfires</b> and these areas are called the wildland-urban interface (WUI). With this increase of people and property vulnerable to <b>wildfires,</b> policies and programs were developed to better prepare for <b>wildfires.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1997, a <b>wildfire</b> {{among the}} hills {{adjacent}} to Machu Picchu threatened the site until fire fighters could cut {{a ring of}} trees to prevent the fire from spreading to the ruins.
