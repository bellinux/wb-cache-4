Conroy reached 100 career points <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals,</b> joining his father Mike as the only such pair in Clarkson's history to reach that milestone. Conroy and the Golden Knights then won the ECAC title with a 3–1 victory over Brown University.|$|E

The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff {{directed}} {{that the}} main objective of the Allied forces in the South Pacific and Southwest Pacific area commands was to capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul on the eastern tip of New Britain.

The Japanese forces in the area mounted a strong resistance, but were unable to stop the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|In a {{follow-up}} to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress. Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions {{on either side of}} Point67. The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in, despite accurate return fire. Over the next few hours, they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains. Against a tenacious German defense and minor infantry and tank counterattacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of capturing both {{the eastern side of the}} Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge.|$|E

In 2006 and 2007, the two organizations worked together to complete DNA testing on the breed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of mapping the Marsh Tacky's place among the horse breeds of the world and beginning a stud book. In 2007, an association was begun with the objective of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky; and in 2010 a closed stud book was created.|$|E
5|$|Following the June 25, 1950, {{outbreak}} of the Korean War after {{the invasion of the}} Republic of Korea (South Korea) by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the United Nations voted to commit troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States, {{as a member of the}} UN, committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of repelling the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. By 1950, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the US 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea. However, it faced numerous disadvantages. The forces were poorly equipped; many battalions had only two companies of infantry, as opposed to the regulation three. Headquarters Company, and supporting platoon elements were much smaller than regulation stated, making them substantially less effective. Most of the soldiers of the division had no combat experience and used to the luxuries of life in occupied Japan. Only one third of the officers in the Task Force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E

In late November the 5thDivision established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau. The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas. By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force's aggressive patrolling. The 5th Division suffered 53fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign. After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong, which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain.|$|E
