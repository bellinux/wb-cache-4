5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E

25|$|Symptomatic {{patients}} are almost exclusively male, {{due to the}} X-linked pattern of inheritance, but female carriers can be clinically affected due to unfavorable lyonization, where random inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD-deficient red blood cells coexisting with unaffected red blood cells. A non-intersex female with one affected X chromosome <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> deficiency in approximately half of her red blood cells. However, in rare cases, including double X-deficiency, the ratio can be much more than half, making the individual almost as sensitive as non-intersex males.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1957 Defence Review, the {{structure}} of the Army has consistently shrunk.

Since 1990, reductions have been almost constant, through succeeding defence reviews: Options for Change (1990), Front Line First (1994), the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003), and the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010. However, the 2015 Review indicated no change from the personnel number targets set in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{almost every}} {{fighting}} scene has a middle point {{which has a}} strong effect on combat. On a ship, this is the flight of stairs leading from the poop deck or forecastle onto the main deck. In a tavern, this is the balcony and the stairs leading up to it. If a combatant has been pushed {{all the way to}} the middle point, a cut scene <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> two combatants moving past the obstacle. On a ship, they run down or up the stairs. In a tavern, the enemy will be knocked down the gallery, and the player will run up the stairs. This has the effect of giving time for the advantage bar to swing back to the neutral position, equalizing the fight somewhat during this cut scene.|$|E

25|$|The major {{component}} of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where two individuals share in common a number of consecutive SNPs, it can be projected that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals {{are considered to be}} a match. The unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. Most companies <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> customers how many cMs they share, and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, {{the relationship between the two}} individuals can be estimated, however due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} for Firestar, ThunderClan's leader, to convince ShadowClan and RiverClan to leave. Finally, RiverClan decides to leave when their river becomes poisoned by humans. ShadowClan also agrees to leave when a tree cut down by humans falls in their camp. While trying help ShadowClan, Firestar loses his second life when a tree falls on him. Midnight, an intelligent badger from the previous book, had told the questing cats that a dying warrior <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> Clans the way to their new home.

As the Clans' spiritual ancestors are represented by the star, Mudfur runs though the night sky as a shooting star and drops behind the mountains, showing the new territory will be beyond the mountains. The Clans travel together through the mountains, guided by Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Tawnypelt, and Stormfur.|$|E

25|$|Madridâs Pride Parade {{began in}} 1977, in the Chueca neighbourhood, which also marked the {{beginning}} of the gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual rights movement after being repressed for forty years in a dictatorship. This claiming of LGBT rights has allowed the Pride Parade in Madrid to grow year after year, becoming one of the best in the world. In 2007, this was recognised by the European Pride Owners Association (EPOA) when Madrid hosted Europride, the Official European Pride Parade. It was hailed by the President of the EPOA as âthe best Europride in historyâ. In 2017, Madrid plans on celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first Pride Parade with WorldPride Madrid 2017. This festival will be the host of many conferences, seminars, workshops, cultural and sports activities, and a âkids and family prideâ that will be a source of education. The hope for this event is that its legacy <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> world a multicultural, diverse, and tolerant society.|$|E
25|$|Saá¹kalpa (Hindi: à¤¸à¤à¥à¤à¤²à¥à¤ª, meaning Resolution): The canto {{begins with}} the concept of {{resolution}} â the poet states that a noble resolution is the true and pure resolution. Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra is born handicapped, and a son Åvetaketu is born to UddÄlaka at the same time. Both uncle and nephew grow up together in UddÄlaka's ÄÅrama. UddÄlaka is more fond of Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra, his disabled grandson, than Åvetaketu. Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra excels in learning from UddÄlaka, outclassing all other disciples including Åvetaketu. On Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra's tenth birthday, UddÄlaka organises a celebration. UddÄlaka makes Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra sit in his lap and starts embracing him. Seeing this, Åvetaketu is possessed by jealousy, and asks Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra to get down from his father's lap. Åvetaketu tells him that UddÄlaka is actually his grandfather, and that he does not know about his real father. Åvetaketu further humiliates Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra by mocking his disability. On hearing about his real father Kahola from SujÄtÄ, Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra thanks Åvetaketu for awakening him. Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra makes a firm resolution of not returning to UddÄlaka's ÄÅrama without his father. The resolution <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> world that the disabled can achieve anything they dream of.|$|E
