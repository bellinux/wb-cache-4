[...] Members of the Association's Eastern, New England, Southern, Florida, and Texas delegations, whose chief spokesman was Gardnar Mulloy, {{were in favor of}} Savitt being named the No. 1 tennis player in the U.S. However, Frank Shields attacked Savitt in a [...] "biting", [...] "unprecedented" [...] speech, which observers said swung the vote against Savitt. As it was reported by Time magazine, [...] "the loudest talker was Frank Shields, non-playing captain of the losing U.S. Davis Cup team. Shields had ignored Savitt in the Davis Cup matches, had put his confidence in aging (30) Ted Schroeder ... {{who turned out to be}} the goat of the series. Shields was intent on keeping Savitt ranked ... at No. 3. Cried Shields: [...] 'Never once in the past three months has Savitt looked like a champion. Not only that, but he was not the most cooperative player in the world <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Australia, and his sounding off brought discredit to the game. He was not a credit either as a player or a representative of America.'" [...] Don McNeill, the 1940 U.S. champion, answered Shields's outburst by pointing out that players are ranked on their tennis ability, that personal prejudice should have nothing to do with ranking, and that Shields' remarks were [...] "uncalled for". [...] That met with [...] "resounding applause" [...] from the delegates. After the heated 5-hour session, one of the longest in U.S.L.T.A. history, President Russell Kingman called Shields's outburst [...] "most unseemly." [...] Australian Davis Cup team Harry Hopman called his arguments as to why Savitt should not be ranked # 1 [...] "weak". [...] Still, a never-before-required proxy vote was needed to decide the # 1 spot. Savitt was ranked the No. 2 player in the U.S. by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, behind Vic Seixas and directly ahead of Tony Trabert. In February 1952, a distraught Savitt announced that he would play only one more tournament, the National Indoor Championships, and then retire from tournament tennis—at age 25.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} version, {{please do not}} quote We investigate {{the relationship between the}} evolution of individual hourly wages over the life-cycle and flexicurity in Denmark – a combination of employer flexibility in hiring and firing, income security during unemployment and a growing emphasis on activation for the unemployed. We use 24 years of population-based longitudinal administrative data on men to model individual wage dynamics, distinguishing between a long term life-cycle profile and transitory wage shocks. We characterised flexicurity using individual membership of an unemployment insurance fund, which is voluntary (80 %) and provides access to part of the flexicurity bundle of income security with activation. We find that, flexicurity is associated with lower starting wage heterogeneity, lower growth rate heterogeneity and greater wage instability. These findings are robust across industries and occupations. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> general unable to distinguish a moral hazard from adverse selection cause, robustness checks suggest that moral hazard, combined with signalling, may the relevant interpretation of our findings...|$|R

We use this Comment as a forum to articulate our side of the story. Our answer consists of two parts.

40|$|Preface In March 2006, roughly 140 {{substorm}} {{researchers from}} around the world descended on Banff Canada for the Eighth International Conference on Substorms (ICS VIII). The meeting was held at The Banff Centre which provided a beautiful venue for the event. Two satellite meetings were held on the preceding weekend. These were a storm-substorm relationship workshop, and the Second International Riometer Workshop. Both drew around 20 attendees, many of whom stayed for ICS VIII.

On the one hand, recent observational, theoretical, and simulation work has uncovered fascinating new facets of the substorm problem. For observational examples, we now have direct and unambiguous observations of mid-tail reconnection from Geotail and Cluster, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> developing a clear picture of the global evolution of the magnetosphere during the substorm, its role in the storm, and interesting new global substorm related phenomena such as sawtooth events.
