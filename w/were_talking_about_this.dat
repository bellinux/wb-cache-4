500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would {{have any idea what}} we <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces. Patriotism and his family's history of soldiering both played a major part in his decision. His father suggested that he wait six months; according to Reg, [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> war being all over in six months with the Maginot Line and all the other garbage that we were told... But we waited six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to do except go to war". Saunders enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 24April 1940, joining up with friends he had made while playing Australian rules football. [...] The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons [...] "substantially of European origin or descent", but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment. He recalled that his fellow soldiers [...] "were not colour-conscious", and that during training in northern Queensland his white mates would sit alongside him in the [...] "Aboriginal" [...] section of movie theatres. His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession: within six weeks of enlistment he was a lance corporal, and after three months he made sergeant.|$|E

But perhaps we may save it yet. We shall have a couple of score of men there in a few minutes." ...|$|E

"You see, Henry," [...] {{continued}} Rollo's father, [...] "I haven't <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{all this}} time {{on account of the}} value of the fish, but to have you understand some of the principles you ought to regard, when any other's property is in your possession.

60|$|Meanwhile, I must say, I {{could not}} agree with my {{guardian}} {{on the subject of}} the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did encourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time, but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said one day when we <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been told to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous.|$|E

"She {{told her}} mother {{that there had been}} a great battle at Windsor between the queen and the prince, the former refusing to give up Miss Knight from her own person to attend on Princess Charlotte as sub-governess. But the prince-regent had gone to Windsor himself, and insisted on her doing so; and the 'old Beguin' was forced to submit, but has been ill ever since: and Sir Henry Halford {{declared}} it was a complete breaking up of her constitution--to the great delight of the two princesses, who <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair. Miss Knight was the very person they wished to have; they think they can do as they like with her. It has been ordered that the Princess Charlotte should not see her mother alone for a single moment; but the latter went into her room, stuffed a pair of large shoes full of papers, and having given them to her daughter, she went home. Lady ---- told me everything was written down and sent to Mr. Brougham NEXT DAY." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> yesterday,” he said. “I {{held that}} life was a ferment, a yeasty {{something}} which devoured life that it might live, and that living was merely successful piggishness. Why, {{if there is anything}} in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and it’s life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.” ...|$|E

"No; I slept, {{ears and}} all, {{for an hour}} or two, for I was pretty well tired; but when I came to myself a little, I found that there were some men in the room, sitting round a table, {{drinking}} and talking; and I thought, before I made much muster, I'd just see what they were up to, especially as I heard them say something about the Quakers. 'So,' says one, 'they are up in the Quaker settlement, no doubt,' says he. Then I listened with both ears, and I found that they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> very party. So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans. This young man, they said, was to be sent back to Kentucky, to his master, who was going to make an example of him, to keep all niggers from running away; and his wife two of them were going to run down to New Orleans to sell, on their own account, and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollars for her; and the child, they said, was going to a trader, who had bought him; {{and then there was the}} boy, Jim, and his mother, they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky. They said that there were two constables, in a town a little piece ahead, who would go in with 'em to get 'em taken up, and the young woman was to be taken before a judge; and one of the fellows, who is small and smooth-spoken, was to swear to her for his property, and get her delivered over to him to take south. They've got a right notion of the track we are going tonight; and they'll be down after us, six or eight strong. So now, what's to be done?" ...|$|E

50|$|Blue Film {{is a very}} {{intimate}} album, but very raunchy as well.
