25|$|Among {{the poets}} of the Matterhorn {{during these years}} (1834 to 1840) were Elie de Beaumont, a famous French geologist; Pierre Jean Édouard Desor, a naturalist of Neuchâtel, who <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with a party of friends, two of whom were Louis Agassiz and Bernhard Studer. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was so filled with admiration for Zermatt and its {{neighbourhood}} that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt {{was at that time}} a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest's, or at the village doctor's.|$|E
500|$|When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a {{teammate}} at Marshall, helped {{get him a}} tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, an assistant coach with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. [...] "I didn't know what was going to happen," [...] he said later. [...] "I just <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to see what would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{war began}} to wind down with Germany's {{surrender}} in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster. The first signing was Otto Graham, a former star quarterback at Northwestern University who was then serving in the Navy. The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and wide receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Fullback Marion Motley and nose tackle Bill Willis, two of the earliest African-Americans to play professional football, also joined the team in 1946. Cleveland's first training camp took place at Bowling Green University in northwestern Ohio. Brown's reputation for winning notwithstanding, joining the team was a risk; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL. [...] "I just <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> {{to see what would}} happen", center Frank Gatski said many years later.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Halvor, 'I {{will not}} <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> till early to-morrow morning; {{let me stay}} here to-night. I can {{sit down on the}} hearth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{hunt for}} a guide, and without delay," [...] said Dick. [...] "I would like to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> before Putnam Hall opens again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{could find}} that funny guy's house," [...] said Thomas, in conclusion, [...] "I'd <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> some day and punch his nose for him." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on a windy day, {{and it was}} {{freezing}} cold. Every time we opened a plan it blew away. And we said Christ! What {{are we going to}} do with these students, where are they going to sit in the sun and all that? Well, we decided, it's got to be cloisters. All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "The view, Mrs. Carr--was there a view? I did {{not notice}} it; indeed, I only <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> at all to please Florence. I don't like that sort of thing." ...|$|E
3000|$|... ‘So we {{take the}} bike, we <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> since there are cycling tracks. They’re safe so we can <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to the {{playground}} by bike. And they can ride.’ (Mother, two children, area 3) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Outside of {{the usual}} {{cleaning}} up, I have had everything left as it was," [...] answered the hotel manager. [...] "You may <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> if you wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{was just}} {{thinking}} how perfectly splendid {{it would be if}} you would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and gnaw a way out of his prison for Chatterer," [...] replied Peter timidly.|$|R
6000|$|But still Lady Lufton did not {{suspect the}} truth. [...] "I think he did," [...] she replied, {{with an air}} of surprise. [...] "I think I heard that he <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to call on Mrs. Robarts after breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} what I said to you--just as straight as my course always is--before we <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> before our lovely drive? I stated to you that I felt--that I always feel--my great hearty hungry public behind me." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the first}} act ended, and the lights <b>went</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> was a spatter of insincere applause from the stalls, echoed in the dress-circle. It grew fainter in the upper circle, and did not reach the gallery at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been thinkin' p'rhaps {{it would}} be better if we didn't <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to-night. Course he's got his crowd with him, an' they could get the best of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The hollows {{are full}} of bear tracks," [...] said Merrifield. [...] "I am sure, if we <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> we'll get one or more black bears and perhaps a grizzly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe," [...] {{said the}} young man; [...] "but I’ll bet you, Mr. Ward, {{for all your}} courage, that you won’t <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> alone at twelve o’clock one night to see." ...|$|R
60|$|All did so, {{and then}} a shout <b>went</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> {{only a few hundred}} yards to the rear, were Chet and Paul, trying their best to run down the horse thieves, whom they had {{discovered}} but a short five minutes before.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Mr. Wecks's father--a {{very old}} man who lived back in the country from here," [...] {{explained}} the barber. [...] "Mr. Wecks <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> last night, and he doesn't expect to come back until after the funeral, which will probably be day after to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ride over them!" [...] shouted somebody. Warning cries <b>went</b> <b>up,</b> <b>there</b> was a {{scattering}} of Lane's ruffians, and the leading horseman pulled up his beast just outside the door. He was dripping with perspiration, bespattered all over, and his horse was white with lather.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "I {{expected}} you would. I will {{be around}} for you at the same time. You're not afraid any more to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, yes, sir," [...] said Philippe. [...] "We take an {{excellent}} carriage from town. The road is very winding to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> the mountain, {{but it is}} perfectly good. A lady can <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> as comfortably as she can ride about town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We’re to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> at five," [...] {{said his}} wife, {{after reading the}} last note. [...] "Mr. Stobell will be at tea at that time, and we’re to drop in as though by accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He hung about, not to {{come over}} here afore dark, but he'll be here soon,' replied Chitling. 'There's nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.' ...|$|E
60|$|For once Soames did not 'change'; it was, perhaps, {{the first}} time in his life that he had sat down to dinner with soiled cuffs, and, not even noticing them, he brooded long over his wine. He sent Bilson to light a fire in his picture-room, and {{presently}} <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> himself.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{very large}} elm-tree before the door, with steps to climb up, and seats among the branches. Marco <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and sat some time, looking down upon the coaches as they wheeled round the tree, in coming up to the door. Then {{he went down to}} the piazza again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did quite right," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "and I {{thank you for}} coming. I told him he might <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> occasionally, but I {{particularly}} warned him against giving any annoyance to the neighbours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They will <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> safe enough," [...] he said, [...] "five of {{them with}} nothing to carry, and the other four ain't heavy loaded. You see them two trees {{standing}} alone on the crest there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought {{we were to}} <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> {{some day}} and play a trick on them," [...] came from Barney Hedge, who, during the summer, had done his full share of trouble-making {{for all of our}} friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} there," [...] said Tabitha slowly. [...] "I’ll swear it, for I {{stood on the}} landing by her door and listened; something scuffling on the floor round and round the room. At first I {{thought it was the}} cat, but when I <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> this morning the door was still locked, and the cat was in the kitchen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Lady Lufton, {{he did not}} go {{up there}} to call on Mrs. Robarts. He <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> because he is making a fool of himself about that Miss Crawley. That is the truth. Now you {{understand}} it all. I hope that Mrs. Robarts does not know it. I do hope for her own sake that Mrs. Robarts does not know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frank Muller {{was here}} three hours ago, {{and told me}} to expect you," [...] she said; [...] "and very glad I am to see an English face again, I can tell you. My name is Gooch. Tell me, is my husband all right in Pretoria? He <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with his waggon just before the siege began, and I have not heard a word from him since." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{said that}} {{a friend of his}} had <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> some years ago, and had not taken enough warm things with him, and had caught a chill there, and had come home and died. He said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I vote we <b>go</b> <b>up</b> again," [...] Tom {{said the}} next morning. [...] "The general has gone forward {{with most of}} the white troops, and there is sure to be {{fighting}} to-day. We shall have nothing to do, and may as well <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> as anywhere else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you've {{got it all}} in her own letter,' {{continued}} Lord Rotherwood. 'You see, they've got a caucus at High Court, and a dinner, and I must <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on Monday; but if you'll {{keep this}} dangerous Fly--' ...|$|R
