To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, which became infamous for the resulting violence. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields {{had gone out of}} control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire" [...] to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women, who had been crowd surfing and moshing, were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that [...] "It was clear that this situation {{had nothing to do with}} Woodstock any more. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... <b>We</b> <b>woke</b> up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1999, {{as part of}} the band's two-year-long {{international}} {{world tour}} in support of their new album, Red Hot Chili Peppers played at Woodstock 1999, which became infamous for the violence that resulted. Some 10minutes before the show, they were asked by Jimi Hendrix's stepsister to play a cover of her brother's songs. After some hesitation due to not having performed the song in years, the band decided to play his classic [...] "Fire", which they had covered on Mother's Milk. Coincidentally, about two thirds of the way into the band's set, the closing set of the three-day concert, a small fire escalated into full-fledged vandalism and resulted in the intervention of riot control squads. The disruption escalated into violence when nearby property including ATMs and several semi-tractor trailers were looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that [...] "It was clear that this situation {{had nothing to do with}} Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... <b>We</b> <b>woke</b> up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'." [...] The tour also originated the band's first concert DVD, 2001's Off the Map.|$|E

[...] The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the Spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes, and other locations of practice, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." [...] The album marked a change in the band's sound, and Kiedis began writing songs reflective of his romantic relationships and drug addictions.|$|E
