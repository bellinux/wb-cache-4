After seeing the play someone suggested that Purcell find other indigenous women to tell their stories. Purcell sought out nine other indigenous women who personally inspired her, some professional, some not. The interviewees comprised politician and former Miss Australia Kathryn Hay, actress Deborah Mailman, netball player Sharon Finnan, United Nations youth delegate Tammy Williams, Rosanna Angus, Cilla Malone, Frances Rings, Lisa Fraser-Gooda and Rachel Perkins. To initiate discussion, Purcell asked each woman the question [...] "Out of the five senses, <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> relate to and what is your first pleasurable memory of that sense?" [...] Her partner Bain Stewart gave her the idea of filming the interviews and using them as the basis for a documentary. Further interviews were conducted over the telephone, particularly when participants felt uncomfortable opening up on-camera. The interviews explored the topics of identity, family and culture in relation to Indigenous Australian women.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether A&E SHOs in the Anglia and Oxford region receive regular case-specific feedback on their referrals to hospital specialists. METHODS: A telephone survey of an A&E SHO from each {{hospital in the}} region, using a semi-structured questionnaire and written protocol. The main questions asked were: (i) <b>do</b> <b>you</b> receive regular feedback about specific patients you refer to other specialties? If so, <b>which</b> <b>one(s)</b> ? and (ii) <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think personal regular case-specific feedback about your referrals would be useful? RESULTS: Overall, 18 A&E SHOs and one staff grade were interviewed, one from each hospital (response rate 100 %). Over the whole region, there were 106 hospital specialties to which A&E SHOs could directly refer out-patient cases. However, regular case-specific communication or feedback was received by the referring A&E SHO from only 5 (4. 7 %). There were 237 hospital specialties to which A&E SHOs could directly refer in-patients. However, regular case-specific feedback was received by the referring A&E SHO from only 3 specialities (1. 3 %). The A&E doctors at 18 of the 19 hospitals (95 %) felt regular case-specific feedback would be useful. Of these, 13 (72 %) would prefer written feedback - 5 (38 %) would prefer {{a copy of the}} discharge summary or GP clinic letter, 6 (46 %) a letter written specifically to the A&E SHO, 1 a letter to be sent via the A&E consultant, and 1 wished for 'any written feedback'. All 18 doctors wanted feedback from {{at least one of the}} specialties of general medicine, paediatrics, trauma and orthopaedics, and general surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A&E SHOs in the Anglia and Oxford region do not receive regular case-specific feedback on their referrals to hospital specialists. Almost all A&E SHOs in this study would welcome it. The situation could be rectified by routinely sending them copies of clinic letters or discharge summaries...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Having {{decided on}} a drug class, an {{individual}} drug needs to be chosen. OBJECTIVE This article discusses the same four factors used in deciding the generic drug within a class {{as well as between}} different drug classes: efficacy, safety, suitability, and cost. DISCUSSION The example of hypertension will be used to illustrate the choice of individual drugs within beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Although a large number of options exist within each class, by considering the above factors, the choice is narrowed to only 1 – 2 preferred options. These drugs should then be added to the P- or Personal-drug list. By only prescribing agents on the P-drug list, the prescriber will become more familiar with their dosing, adverse effects, and interactions, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Also when a new drug becomes available, it clearly needs to be better for the patient in terms of these factors, before it is added to the P-drug list. Consider the case of Beryl. You decidethat based on the hypertension {{and the fact that she}} has ongoing angina on exertion, she should be prescribed a beta blocker. Well, <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> choose? There are a large number of dif-ferent beta blockers available on the Australian market. Table 1 lists some of the differences between them. In terms of efficacy, all of the beta blockers on the list would be similar except for those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These agents (pindolol and oxprenolol) reduce exercise induced tachycardia and resting heart rate to a lesser extent than beta blockers without ISA, and have not been shown to benefit patients after myocardial infarction. In terms of safety, all of the beta blockers listed would have the usual con-Case history Beryl is 76 years old and had a myocardial infarction six months ago.
