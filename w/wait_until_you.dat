He's very disciplined, he's good-looking, and all the sisters want him." [...] Sanders enjoyed the food so much, she agreed to come back and meet the woman's minister. At the second dinner, the nurse's aide told her the minister was present and Sanders thought to herself, [...] "Big deal."

500|$|Throughout the {{majority}} of 2015 and 2016, Gaga teased the creative and recording process of the album on her social media accounts. It was also reported that she was seen collaborating with longtime producer RedOne, Giorgio Moroder, Mark Ronson, and Nile Rodgers, among others. Ronson confirmed their collaboration and added that the music recorded with Gaga was [...] "some of [...] favorite music [...] really ever worked on. It's incredible– [...] it. [...] can't <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> can hear it because the music speaks for itself– it's some of [...] favorite musicians of all time are working on it." [...] The producer additionally hinted the involvement of Kevin Parker, the frontman for the Australian psychedelic rock band Tame Impala, which BBC Music later confirmed to be true. In an interview with fashion website Buro247, Ronson claimed {{that it was one}} of his favourite recording that he had worked, and commended the associated musicians and writers.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the French Directory sank in {{popularity}} after military defeats and mismanagement. Back in Paris, Sérurier {{became part of}} the Bonaparte faction, having seen nothing but disaster since serving under the military genius. Bonaparte launched the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 during which Sérurier led a reserve detachment of soldiers at the Pont-du-Jour. The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted the lawmakers from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, [...] "The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. Do not stir soldiers; <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> get orders". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use auxiliary battalions on 15 November 1799. He {{became a member of the}} Sénat conservateur (Senate) on 27 December.|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics were}} less positive. The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".|$|E

2500|$|During the show, {{there was}} a [...] "fierce {{competition}} between the Anglo-French Concorde and the Russian Tu-144". [...] The Soviet pilot, Mikhail Kozlov, had bragged that he would outperform the Concorde. [...] "Just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> see us fly," [...] he was quoted as saying. [...] "Then you'll see something." [...] On {{the final day of}} the show, the Concorde, which was not yet in production, performed its demonstration flight first. [...] Its performance was later described as being unexciting, and it has been theorized that Kozlov was determined to show how much better his aircraft was.|$|E

2500|$|Formula One driver Bruno Senna is {{the nephew}} of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: [...] "If you think I'm fast, just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> see my nephew Bruno." [...] Due {{to the death of}} his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E
2500|$|Revisiting the {{commercial}} in Harper's Magazine {{thirty years after}} it aired, Rebecca Solnit suggested that [...] "1984" [...] did not so much herald {{a new era of}} liberation as a new era of oppression. She wrote, [...] "I want to yell at the liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer, 'Don't do it!' Apple is not different. That industry is going to give rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny, to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration. To suicidal, underpaid Chinese factory workers whose reality must be like that of the shuffling workers in {{the commercial}}.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{can take}} you back to the hut of the gardener's boy," [...] promised the Ork, [...] "for when I fly high in the air I can look down and easily spy the King's castle.
