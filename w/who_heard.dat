5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5000|$|Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh said: When Abu al-Hasan al-Ridha {{arrived at}} Neyshabour {{and decided to}} leave the city to join Ma'mun, the hadith {{scholars}} gathered around him and said: [...] "O son of Allah's apostle, are you leaving us without pronouncing a beneficial hadith for us?" [...] He (Ali al-Ridha) while sitting in palanquin let his out head and said: [...] "I heard from my father Musa ibn Jafar <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from his father Jafar ibn Mohammad <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from his father Mohammad ibn Ali <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from Ali ibn Husayn <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from his father Husayn ibn Ali <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from his father, the commander of the faithful, [...] Ali ibn abi Talib <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from Allah's apostle, peace be upon him and his household, <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> from Gabriel <b>who</b> said he <b>heard</b> that Allah said: [...] "There is no god but Allah is my fortress whoever enters my fortress shall be safe from my punishment" [...] and when the convoy moved he (Ali al-Ridha) shouted: [...] "There are few conditions and I am one of its conditions".|$|R

5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|Castiel gets {{a job at}} a {{gas station}} and {{attempts}} to adjust to his new life as a human. He helps Dean hunt a rogue angel that is killing people in emotional pain, but later prays for help when Dean sends him away for the second time on Ezekiel's orders. Castiel is found by the neutral angel Muriel <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> his prayer. Muriel agrees to provide information but the two are captured by angels that have been trailing Muriel. Castiel and Muriel are taken to the anarchist angel Malachi, the leader of one side of the angel civil war (the other side being headed by the angel Bartholomew), and tortured for information on Metatron. Muriel is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions. The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared {{on the morning of}} the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Tokyo, Saya saves {{a girl named}} Mana Hiiragi from a berserk {{humanoid}} Elder Bairn. Mana and Saya are rescued by Mana's comrades in SIRRUT, a covert group resisting Fumito's group <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> about Saya's past through Itsuki Tomofusa, a spy who died following the experiment. The group is led by Fumito's relative Kuroto Mogari, whose family was killed so Fumito could have control over the Shrovetide. Kuroto offers Saya SIRRUT's aid finding Fumito in exchange for her help. Hunted by Tower, and after saving Mana from Youth Ordinance Bill enforcers, Saya agrees to help. Saya and Mana infiltrate a private academy funded by Fumito when {{he is scheduled to}} give a lecture. When Saya attacks, it is revealed to be a trap baited with a false version of Fumito, and she must fight off an Elder Bairn before they can escape. In the aftermath, Mana reveals that her father disappeared after she helped him with his research into Tower. Regaining her confidence as a hacker, Mana locates Tower's main base, allowing Saya to infiltrate the base.|$|E
5|$|Evacuation orders {{began on}} September 16, when {{officials}} issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, {{all of which}} but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from Cape Fear northward were under a mandatory evacuation. A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the Outer Banks and 77% of residents in storm surge-prone areas of the Pamlico Sound did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation. The two primary reasons stated for the residents' evacuation decisions were the hurricane's strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official evacuation notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A {{majority of the respondents}} to the survey <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> the evacuation notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative's house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to Virginia. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative's house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing evacuation orders, the duration of the evacuation process varied between 3hours to 12hours in Dare County. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.|$|E

5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, <b>who</b> <b>heard</b> movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

40|$|Sources of AIDS {{awareness}} among {{rural and}} urban Indian women were analysed {{using data from the}} National Family and Health Survey (1998 – 2000). Two measures were developed to study the impact each source had on knowledge. ‘Effectiveness’ was defined as the proportion of women <b>who</b> had <b>heard</b> of AIDS from only one source, from among women <b>who</b> had <b>heard</b> of AIDS from that particular source and other sources. ‘Independent effect’ was the proportion <b>who</b> had <b>heard</b> of AIDS from only one source in relation to all women <b>who</b> had <b>heard</b> of AIDS. Television was the most effective medium, and also had the highest independent effect. Radio and print had very low effectiveness and independent effect. Although television and print audiences are growing in India, it is likely a sub-group of women will continue to lack media access. There is an urgent need to disseminate AIDS awareness to this ‘media underclass’. Since the media will not reach this group, other sources including health workers, community level activities such as adult education programmes, and networks of friends and relatives need to be explored...|$|R
