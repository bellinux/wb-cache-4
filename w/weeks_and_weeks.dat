Hoppus described a scenario, detailed in the lyrics, where former lovers meet in public and one is with someone new. [...] "It really hurts when you aren't the person feeling the love, {{but you have to}} act like it's cool to save face," [...] he said in 1998. He felt the song's creation, which was spontaneous, worked to its favor: [...] "If you work on a song for <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks,</b> you're forcing it." [...] The signature guitar line for [...] "Dammit" [...] was created on an acoustic guitar that was missing two strings. Guitarist Tom DeLonge considered the song a breakthrough in the band's songwriting.|$|E
