5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction.

5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale {{felt that}} it was time to rest the character.

5|$|Algocen Realty Holdings Ltd., {{the real}} estate branch on the Algoma Central Railway first {{commissioned}} The Algo Centre Mall project. The project was subsequently approved by the Ontario Municipal Board in 1978, with an estimated cost of $10 million. Construction then began in 1979 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> being finished the next year. The 80-room Algo Inn, the town's largest hotel and retirement residence, was also built into the mall. In its first year, 1980, the mall featured Woolco, Dominion, and Shoppers Drug Mart, {{and a total of}} 35 units. A distinct architectural feature of the building was rooftop parking.|$|E
5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him to produce an unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script.

Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E

5|$|Castro was {{initially}} disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> {{as he did}} not want to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was the decisions of the executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E
5|$|Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had {{acquired}} the film rights in 1960 and {{had attempted to}} get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R.

The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E

5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} erecting the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney.

Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> citing economic reasons.|$|E

Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and enhanced with a number of tools.|$|E

He involved students in the governmental duties associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. Concepts such as women’s suffrage and political ambition came into play. A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees in a political campaign.|$|E
5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
