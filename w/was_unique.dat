5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. She argues that what <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape {{could be used as a}} weapon to terrorise the people.|$|E
5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> {{in that it}} could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Nitro {{was also}} in a {{sporadic}} feud with John Cena throughout {{the second half of}} 2006. The feud <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> in that it also later involved non-wrestler Kevin Federline, who appeared on October 16 episode of Raw. Federline was then, in storyline, trained by Nitro for a match with Cena, which he won after interference from Umaga.|$|E
5|$|The layout <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> {{within the}} city of Napa, {{and may have been}} unique within California. The site {{differentiated}} from most agricultural sites by facing away from the road, with no distinct difference between middle-class and workers' houses, in size, finishing, or location. Many of the buildings shared walls or were built abutting each other, and two of the houses were built over a single basement.|$|E
5|$|This cavalry charge <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> {{during the}} whole of the First World War, being the only one carried out in the dark and across country, which had not been {{previously}} reconnoitred. The ground was found to be scattered with clumps of long spiked thistles, and a number of pitfalls causing nine men to be injured from falls during the charge.|$|E
30|$|The {{uniqueness}} of {{solution to the}} mean-field FBSDE (consisting of the four Eqs. (1) with (X,u)=(X∗,u∗) and (6)-(8)) {{can be obtained from}} {{uniqueness of}} optimal controls.

Zyos insisted upon his teammates being silent and not trash-talking during matches {{in order to maintain}} focus.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 1948 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1947–48 Football League First Division. It was the club's sixth league title and striker Ronnie Rooke scored 33 goals in the campaign to become the division's top goalscorer. The other Charity Shield place went to Manchester United who beat Blackpool to win {{the final of the}} 1947–48 FA Cup. Manchester United's progress in the competition <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> as the club was drawn against teams from the First Division in every round. Their home ties were staged at three different grounds as Old Trafford was being repaired from the damage sustained in the Manchester Blitz.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
50|$|Identifiers in VDEX data should <b>be</b> persistent, <b>unique,</b> resolvable, {{transportable}} and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> URIs, whereas {{term and}} relationship identifiers should <b>be</b> locally <b>unique</b> strings.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{district}} names had <b>been</b> <b>unique</b> {{within a}} single province and as of 2008 prefecture boundaries are roughly aligned to provincial boundaries, most district names <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> within their prefectures.|$|R

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers. She {{formed the basis for}} several subsequent designs, beginning with Charles Martel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer had {{completed}} {{the first draft of}} Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, in the part of Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E
50|$|Projective {{covers and}} their {{superfluous}} epimorphisms, when they exist, <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> up to isomorphism. The isomorphism need not <b>be</b> <b>unique,</b> however, since the projective property {{is not a}} full fledged universal property.|$|R
30|$|The {{center and}} the radius of the circumball <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> but for the inball, the radius <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> but the center may not <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> For example, the {{rectangle}} with vertices (- 2,- 1), (2,- 1), (- 2, 1) and (2, 1), any point belongs to the line segment on the x-axis between (- 1, 0) and (1, 0) can be a center for an inball.|$|R

5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Prosaurolophus was {{studied with}} other hadrosaurids by Wagner. The genus, along with Corythosaurus and Maiasaura, were {{considered}} by Wagner to be synonymous with Saurolophus, Hypacrosaurus and Brachylophosaurus respectively. Prosaurolophus maximus was reassigned to Saurolophus as S. maximus. The same year however, Prosaurolophus {{was found to}} be distinct from Saurolophus, in an analysis of Hu et al.. Their analysis <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> from any of the time, and they recovered Prosaurolophus in Saurolophinae, with Saurolophus, Lophorhothon, Tsintaosaurus, Jaxartosaurus, and Kritosaurus. No other analysis has recovered this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, one of {{the more}} {{recognisable}} canine stars was restaurateur and chef Rick Stein's irrepressible terrier Chalky, who frequently upstaged his owner on his various cookery series. He <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> in having his own line of merchandise, including plushes, tea towels, art prints, art paw prints and two real ales – Chalky's Bite and Chalky's Bark, which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009. Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component <b>was</b> <b>unique</b> amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
