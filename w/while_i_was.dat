25|$|When my father, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E
25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|When {{my husband}} was {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E

25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never uttered a sound <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Bingham {{also stated}} that Ford was [...] "the bravest player I ever played with" [...] and {{described}} his physical condition, remarking [...] "the two of us would lift weights, and I don't think he broke a sweat <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> struggling to lift some of them". Away from his physicality, Ford was also noted for his immense work rate and accurate finishing.|$|E
500|$|Other {{actors have}} also used Terry-Thomas's persona as an {{inspiration}} for their characters: Dustin Hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of the character Captain Hook in Hook on Terry-Thomas; Rupert Everett disclosed that when he provided the voice for Prince Charming in Shrek 2 Terry-Thomas [...] "was vocally my role model <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing it"; and Paul Whitehouse's character, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, from The Fast Show was also modelled on Terry-Thomas's on-screen persona.|$|E

500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating {{and his eyes were}} always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still laughing."" ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> visiting Andrew at {{his country}} estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he {{suddenly}} {{sat down at}} the piano and played the most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless to say, I grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The vast majority of the original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E
2500|$|But, {{towards the}} Buddha, {{who came from}} the Sakyan people, King Pasenadi reveres, praises, and serves the Buddha with utmost respect. Even the monarch thinks like this: [...] "The Shramana Gotama had perfect birth, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not perfect. The Shramana Gotama <b>is</b> mighty, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> weak. The Shramana Gotama {{inspired}} awe and respect, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> do not. The Shramana Gotama is vastly influential and charming, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> only possess small influence." [...] As even the King respects Dhamma, reveres Dhamma, and obeys Dhamma, therefore he bows and praises the Tathagatha.|$|R

500|$|Harvey {{is also an}} {{accomplished}} sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre. In 2010, she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola's literary magazine [...] The issue featured Harvey's paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen. Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011, Harvey said: [...] "the first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine. They were drawn <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing and recording the record (Let England Shake). It does relate to the record {{in the way the}} cycle keeps happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. When I got home, there was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing me things and I was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|E

500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used {{to come down to}} Top of the Pops, and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs. And that's where Ray [...] got the idea for 'Lola'. When he was invited too, he wrote it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting drunk".|$|E
500|$|Both Compton and Groves {{proposed}} that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-{{proposed that}} the semiworks be {{operated by the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to {{be found at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university [...] would be operating an industrial facility [...] from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University [...] "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President Robert Hutchins returned, he greeted Compton with [...] "I see, Arthur, that <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gone you doubled the size of my university".|$|E
500|$|Theatrical actress Pascale Armand got {{the role}} of Akela Amador a week after auditioning, and {{received}} the episode's script the night before traveling to Los Angeles.
