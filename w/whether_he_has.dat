5|$|During a {{field trip}} to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he {{promptly}} throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.|$|E
5|$|In the serial, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and {{his companions}} Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) are {{travelling}} back {{to the space station}} via transmat beam from a previous story to return to the TARDIS, when they are intercepted by the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, and are directed to Skaro to the time of the Daleks' creation. The Timelords want the Doctor to avert their future terrorisation of other species. The Doctor faces the dilemma of <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the right to do so.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{resolves}} {{to give up}} {{alcohol and}} start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the motel and asks Mac <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hethcote {{received}} this copious flow of information, in some doubt <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been made {{the victim of}} coarse raillery, or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> merely heard a quaint statement of facts.|$|R
50|$|Simply put, the president's {{deposition}} testimony regarding <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{ever been}} alone with Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever engaged in {{sexual relations with}} Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally false....|$|R

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> completed that stage.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the two series, {{the plot}} centres on the {{ambiguity}} concerning Tyler's predicament {{and the lack}} of clarity, to both the audience and the character, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> died, become comatose, or actually travelled back in time.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> or has not made a {{sufficient}} knowledge {{of what has been}} done by others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{he went down}} into camp to strengthen the associations <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made, to buy claims, and to gamble. Upon his return Joan, peeping through a crack between the boards, could always tell <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been gambling, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won or lost.|$|R
60|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{meant to}} drown himself, and {{lighting}} on the shallow, had stumbled on till he fell exhausted: or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> merely blundered into the stream, careless whither he went, Tom knew not, and never knew; for Elsley himself could not recollect.|$|R

25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|E
25|$|One summer, Mr. O'Brien {{takes a long}} {{business}} trip. While he is away, {{the boys}} enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating {{to work in an}} inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.|$|E
25|$|Prince Shuysky now enters. Boris insults him, {{accusing him}} of conspiring with Pushkin, an {{ancestor}} of the poet. However, the prince brings grave tidings. A Pretender has appeared in Lithuania. Boris angrily demands to know his identity. Shuysky fears the Pretender might attract a following bearing the name of Tsarevich Dmitriy. Shaken by this revelation, Boris dismisses Fyodor. He orders Shuysky to seal the border with Lithuania, and, clearly {{on the edge of}} madness, asks Shuysky <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ever heard of dead children rising from their graves to question Tsars. Boris seeks assurance that the dead child the prince had seen in Uglich was really Dmitriy. He threatens Shuysky, if he dissembles, with a gruesome execution. The Prince describes the ghastly scene of Dmitriy's murder in a brief and beautiful aria ("In Uglich, in the cathedral"). But he gives hints that a miracle (incorruptibility) has occurred. Boris begins choking with guilt and remorse, and gives a sign for Shuysky to depart.|$|E
25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taught evolution. Scopes later {{admitted}} that, in reality, he was unsure of <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial.|$|R

500|$|Livingstone {{defended his}} claim about Hitler and Zionism by {{reference}} to Lenni Brenner's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, and many commentators suggested that Livingstone {{was referring to the}} Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany. Livingstone's statements were criticised by historians, among them Roger Moorhouse, who said that they were historically inaccurate. However political scientist Norman Finkelstein said that whilst [...] "Livingstone maybe wasn’t precise enough, and lacked nuance", his comments did reflect an initial ambivalence on the part of Hitler towards Zionism. Following Livingstone's remarks about Hitler which prompted accusations of antisemitism, he allegedly told an audience at an event that [...] "It’s absurd to call me an anti-Semite, as two of my ex-girlfriends are Jewish. It’s offensive to them to say they were lying in bed next to someone who hates them." [...] Similarly, the accusations made him question <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> Jewish ancestry on his mother's side.|$|E
500|$|Later that night, a {{large group}} of Scientologists, {{including}} John Travolta, gather outside the Marsh house to celebrate Hubbard's [...] "second coming". The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. They are opposed to Stan's participation, but the president informs them that [...] "we're not asking him to join us; we're asking him to lead us". Randy sends Stan to his room, where he finds Tom Cruise waiting. Cruise, believing that Stan is genuinely Hubbard's reincarnation, asks him <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> enjoyed his acting. When [...] "Hubbard" [...] replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy, Tom hears that he is [...] "a failure {{in the eyes of the}} prophet" [...] and locks himself in Stan's closet. He refuses to come out, despite the entreaties of Randy, Nicole Kidman, the police, Travolta and R. Kelly to [...] "come out of the closet". Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet.|$|E
500|$|Cartman's anti-Semitism, while mostly {{limited to}} mocking Kyle, culminates {{in the season}} eight (2004) episode [...] "The Passion of the Jew". In the episode, Cartman, after {{watching}} The Passion of the Christ numerous times, deifies the film's director, Mel Gibson, and starts an official Gibson fan club, praising Gibson for [...] "trying to express—through cinema—the horror and filthiness of the common Jew". Cartman's interpretation of the film influences him to dress up as Adolf Hitler and lead other fan club members (who are oblivious of Cartman's actual intentions) in a failed effort {{to engage in a}} systematic genocide of the Jews {{similar to that of the}} Final Solution. In the season 10 (2006) episode [...] "Smug Alert!", Cartman anonymously saves Kyle's life in an effort to get him and his family to return to South Park from San Francisco, revealing that he craves the animosity shared between the two. And in [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends" [...] (season 14, 2010), Cartman directs the [...] "evil god" [...] Cthulhu to destroy [...] "most of the synagogues". However, in the 16th-season episode [...] "Jewpacabra" [...] Cartman revealed he had converted to Judaism after a hallucinogenic dream. As of season 19, it is unsure <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> retained this trait or whether it was simply a plot point in that one episode.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} {{remember}} the number of 'Every Other Week' office, where he suddenly decided to stop before he went home. He wished to see Fulkerson, and ask him something about Beaton: <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been about lately, and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> dropped any hint {{of what had happened}} concerning Christine; Dryfoos believed that Fulkerson was in the fellow's confidence.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they inquired along seven lines before they {{determined}} that a genital discharge rendered a man unclean. A discharge caused by one of these reasons did not render the man impure or subject him to bringing an offering. They asked: (1) about his food, (2) about his drink, (3) what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> carried, (4) <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> jumped, (5) <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been ill, (6) what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen, and (7) <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> obscene thoughts. It did not matter <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had thoughts before or after seeing a woman. Rabbi Judah taught that the discharge would not render him unclean if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> watched animals having intercourse or even if he merely saw a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva taught that the discharge would not render him unclean even if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eaten any kind of food, good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. The Sages exclaimed to Rabbi Akiva that according to his view, no more men would ever be rendered unclean by genital discharge. Rabbi Akiva replied that {{one does not have}} an obligation to ensure that there exist men unclean because of a genital discharges.|$|R

500|$|In {{light of}} [...] "And Then There Were Fewer", the Griffins {{watch on the}} news where Tom Tucker reveals that Diane Simmons {{committed}} the murders at James Woods' mansion and is now dead. Tom then introduces Diane's successor, Joyce Kinney. As Lois reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative {{radio talk show host}} Rush Limbaugh is holding a book signing in Quahog, causing Brian to decide to confront Limbaugh about his political beliefs. At the signing, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian; he asks him <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh defeats them all. Thankful, Brian agrees to read Limbaugh's book, and overnight becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian's conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois mentions that Brian goes {{out of his way to}} not agree with the general consensus on many things (for example, he hated Slumdog Millionaire and Titanic but defends the movie Cocktail), and accuses him of being a [...] "contrarian" [...] rather than a genuine believer. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain.|$|E
