5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world.

25|$|In her day-to-day life, <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> too boring or upsetting, Selma {{slips into}} daydreams {{or perhaps a}} trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} {{critical}} voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of The Guardian. Jordison detailed his misgivings about A Game of Thrones in a 2009 review and summarized [...] "It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading.... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, {{especially when it comes}} to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [...]" [...] Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:That <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> on the whole, pretty crappy , it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments, responding, [...] "I've watched Rachel struggle. She's always {{trying to do the}} right thing, or thinks she's {{trying to do the right}} thing, and it always gets messed up." [...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going to work out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears. [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011. The song was also released on the iTunes Store in the United States on March15,2011. In the episode performance, Rachel Berry (Michele) appears performing the song with a bedazzled microphone, wearing a blue dress, black belt, and boots, accompanied by Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) in the background.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{newspaper}} {{gave the}} film a generally favourable assessment: its critic wrote, [...] "Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business {{when it comes}} to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who knows what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand <b>when</b> <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> on the rampage." [...] Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the News of the World, who found that [...] "with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy… all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it" [...] while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised [...] "a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual" [...] and Today's Cinema called it [...] "one of the best essays in science fiction to date" [...] Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said, [...] "This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British!". Similarly, William Whitebait in the New Statesman, who found the film to be [...] "better than either War of the Worlds or Them!", also called for [...] "a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick".|$|E

2500|$|Between 1981 and 1985, Haggard scored 12 more top-10 country hits, {{with nine}} of them {{reaching}} number one, including [...] "My Favorite Memory," [...] "Going Where the Lonely Go," [...] "Someday <b>When</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> Good," [...] and [...] "Natural High." [...] In addition, Haggard recorded two chart-topping duets with George Jones—"Yesterdays' Wine" [...] in 1982—and with Willie Nelson—"Pancho and Lefty" [...] in 1983. Nelson believed the 1983 Academy Award-winning film Tender Mercies, {{about the life of}} fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard. [...] Actor Robert Duvall and other filmmakers denied this and claimed the character was based on nobody in particular. Duvall, however, said he was a big fan of Haggard's.|$|E

2500|$|Safewords {{are words}} or phrases that are called out <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> either not going as planned or have crossed a {{threshold}} one cannot handle. They are something both parties can remember and recognize and are, by definition, not words commonly used playfully during {{any kind of}} scene. Words such as no, stop, and don't, are often inappropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent. The most commonly used safewords are red and yellow, with red meaning that play must stop immediately, and yellow meaning that the activity needs to slow down. [...] At most clubs and group-organized BDSM parties and events, dungeon monitors (DMs) provide an additional safety net for the people playing there, ensuring that house rules are followed and safewords respected.|$|E
2500|$|With Orbit's {{production}} style, Madonna {{found that}} her European sensibilities was {{in line with}} that of the producer, which suited the songs being composed. The sessions with Orbit were [...] "incredibly quick and spontaneous" [...] since both of them were committed to the record. However, they still had many conversations and [...] "discussions about philosophy or quantum physics". When it came to working with Benny and Alle Benassi, the singer faced difficulty in communicating with the former, since he was not fluent in English. Also, Madonna had never worked with them previously, so there was a prevalent shyness in her communication. She ultimately asked Alle Benassi to be an interpreter which this was difficult for all three of them. But eventually they were able to overcome the challenge in lieu of the music being composed. [...] "With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> working and when they're not," [...] clarified Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2016, the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF) sent {{a notice}} of {{evacuation}} of {{the headquarters of}} two TV stations owned by Dan Voiculescu, sentenced in August 2014 to 10 years imprisonment in a corruption case with 60 million euros worth of prejudice. In this context, Klaus Iohannis stated that ANAF approach in Antena TV Group case is [...] "hasty", [...] "inappropriate" [...] and that [...] "freedom of expression in media can not be suppressed for trivial administrative reasons". His position was met {{with a wave of}} criticism from supporters and public figures. On the same note, Iohannis stated that union with Moldova is [...] "a less serious approach" [...] {{in the context of the}} Transnistrian problem, of differences between Romania and Moldova regarding economic stability and fighting corruption, and can be discussed <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> stable in both countries. The statement sparked indignation among unionists who accused him of demagogy, considering that during the electoral campaign of 2014 he expressed a favorable position on the issue.|$|E

2500|$|Monk's {{compulsive}} {{habits are}} numerous, {{and a number}} of phobias compound his situation, such as his fear of germs. Monk is afraid of 312 things, including milk, ladybugs, harmonicas, heights, imperfection, claustrophobia, driving, food touching on his plates, messes, and risk. (He has a breakthrough from claustrophobia later in the series.) The OCD and plethora of phobias inevitably lead to very awkward situations and cause problems for Monk and anyone around him as he investigates cases. These same personal struggles, particularly the OCD, are what aid him in solving cases: his sharp memory, specific mindset, and attention to detail. In one episode, [...] "Mr. Monk and His Biggest Fan", Marci Maven has compiled a list of all of Adrian's fears. In another episode, he tries to conquer his fears by doing various activities which involve his phobias. For example, he tries drinking milk, climbing a ladder, and putting a ladybug on his hand, but <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> scattered unorganized across a table, he cannot resist the compulsion to arrange them neatly.|$|E
2500|$|While Iturbide's reign lasted {{less than}} a year, it {{was the result of}} and further defined the {{struggle}} between republican and traditional ideals, not only in Mexico, but also in Europe. For a number of Mexican autonomists, a constitutionally sanctioned monarchy seemed a logical {{solution to the problem of}} creating a new state as it seemed to be a compromise between those who pushed for a representative form of government and those who wished to keep Mexico's monarchist traditions. One must keep in mind that a Republican, Federalist government was virtually unheard of, and that for 300 years New Spain had lived in a monarchy. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> viewed in this light, historian Eric Van Young states that Iturbide's seizure of the crown [...] "seems less cynical and idiosyncratic when it comes along at the end of the independence struggle." [...] However, the rest of the 19th century would be marked by oscillation between the two political extremes, with each side gaining the upper hand at one point or another. The old Mexican nobility kept their titles and coats-of-arms close at hand, ready for a comeback. Members of the Iturbide family intrigued against the Mexican government in Madrid, New York City, Paris, and Rome as late as the 1890s.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the letter}} signed by Ingraham and Gray, Meares had made many false claims about the events of 1789. The Portuguese ships, Ingraham said, were {{definitely}} British ships pretending to be Portuguese. The [...] "house" [...] that Meares said he built at Nootka Sound, and which was explicitly mentioned in the Nootka Convention, was only a [...] "rough hut", built and torn down in 1788. By 1789, when the Spanish arrived, [...] "there was no vestige of any house remaining". The Nootka Convention said that Spain had seized buildings and that these must be restored to Britain. Further, Ingraham wrote that Meares had not purchased any land from Maquinna, as claimed. About the arrest of James Colnett by Esteban José Martínez, Ingraham and Gray wrote that Colnett had insulted and threatened Martínez, and that Colnett had drawn his sword on Martínez, justifying Colnett's arrest. The letter closed with a statement of friendship: [...] "We sincerely hope, sir, <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> represented with truth, it will rescue our friend Don Estevan J. Martínez from censure... As {{to the treatment of}} the Americans by Don Estevan, we have ever testified to it in terms due to such hospitality, and we are again happy to have it in our power to do what we deem justice to his conduct." [...] The Americans were not a neutral party; the United States had only gained its independence from Britain through war a few years before. Also, the Americans were in direct competition with the British, but not the Spanish, for the fur trade of the Northwest coast. It was in their interest to support the Spanish case.|$|E
