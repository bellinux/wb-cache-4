5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seven Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as to call it the greatest film ever made.

Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E
