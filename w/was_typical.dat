5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for the period, mintage for the coin was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse {{side of the coin}} depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey. This <b>was</b> <b>typical.</b> Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Anne's early {{education}} <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> {{for women of}} her class. In 1513, Anne was {{invited to join the}} schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. She developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework, and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess, and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding, and hunting.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947 behind an offensive attack that employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively than <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> at the time. The Browns' offensive success {{was driven by}} Brown's version of the T formation, which was gradually replacing the single-wing formation as football's most popular and effective scheme.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{served on}} the board of {{trustees}} for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory primary election law passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for the party. Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to King Swope, a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman.|$|E
5|$|Hensley's theology, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his snake handling, <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of other fundamentalist Pentecostal churches. His teachings on personal holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the Wesleyan Holiness tradition. In his sermons he condemned a number of practices as sinful, including gambling, consuming alcohol, wearing lipstick, and playing baseball.|$|E

5|$|Horn used pre-dated {{technology}} for the album to have sounds unlike what <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> in records that were released at the time. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{examples}} of a genetic trait aggravated by royal family intermarriage was the House of Habsburg, which inmarried particularly often and is known for the mandibular prognathism of the Habsburger (Unter) Lippe (otherwise known as the 'Habsburg jaw', 'Habsburg lip' or 'Austrian lip'"). This <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for many Habsburg relatives over a period of six centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} chess tournament was {{organized}} by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for the time. Sparkling games like Anderssen's Immortal game and Evergreen game or Morphy's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{belong to}} the calc-alkaline series. Trace element data <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> for Central Volcanic Zone rocks. High {{potassium}} content <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for shoshonite-like lavas erupted at large distance from the trenches.|$|R
50|$|As <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> in Spanish, older {{adjectives}} {{of places}} {{are used as}} demonyms for people from those areas. Today, it <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> in Spanish to refer to Colombians as neogranadinos ("New Granadians"), especially in neighboring Venezuela.|$|R

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, were {{designed}} for the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for steerage traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage. The Köln-class steerage compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than <b>was</b> <b>typical,</b> and included cabins that housed from four to ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultraviolet}} protection factor (UPF) is {{a similar}} scale developed for rating fabrics for sun protective clothing. According to recent testing by Consumer Reports, UPF ~30 <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for protective fabrics, while UPF ~6 <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for standard summer fabrics.|$|R

50|$|In the sonnet {{there are}} both neoclassical and romantic elements: {{references}} to the classical tradition (Aphrodite, Homer and Odysseus) <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of neoclassicism and {{the focus on the}} poet, the theme of graves and remains and the homesickness <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of romanticism.|$|R
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of the third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for a nova.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Chinese {{businesses}} began relocating {{from the}} Loop to Chicago's South Side. Starting this trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson {{to design a}} building large enough to house 15stores, 30apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road). Built in 1912 for $200,000, the building's design <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of the period; however, it featured white tile trim adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony. The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914.|$|E
50|$|Pastissets, {{a typical}} sweet made of pastry {{with a sweet}} almond or sweet potato filling. It is of {{probable}} Arab origin and <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of most of Valencia and the south of Catalonia. A similar dish, called rubiols, <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> in Majorca.|$|R

5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008 {{a company}} from the 1st Commando Regiment {{became the first}} formed Army Reserve unit to see combat since World War II when it was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of the}} Australian Special Operations Task Group. The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry finding that the company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations than <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> and who could not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E
