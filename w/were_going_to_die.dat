500|$|When rumors {{circulated}} on the Internet {{and were}} mentioned in ABC commercials that the characters <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> some viewers {{hoped for a}} [...] "double murder" [...] of Nikki and Paulo and rejoiced when their wish was granted. Over {{three months before the}} episode aired on television, Santoro stated in an interview with Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character would die {{in the middle of the}} third season. It was also announced that Sanchez had signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for another ABC show, Football Wives, and thus, it would have been unlikely for her to continue to act as a [...] "murderous femme fatale".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jigsaw {{did not come}} until months later, when Whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines. Convinced it was a brain tumor, {{he went to a}} neurologist to have an MRI and while sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, [...] "What if you were given the news that you had a tumor and you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> soon? How would you react to that?" [...] He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.|$|E

500|$|... "Two for the Road" [...] {{was viewed}} by 15.03million American viewers, which was 1.5million {{less than the}} ratings {{compared}} to the previous year. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. TV Squad's C. K. Sample wrote that [...] "Two for the Road" [...] was [...] "a great episode that I thoroughly enjoyed", although he did feel [...] "badly for Sawyer and Hugo". Sample also wrote that although he suspected that Ana-Lucia and Libby <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com wrote that the episode contained the [...] "Biggest ... twist ... ever." [...] Slocum {{went on to say}} that if you had not seen the episode, [...] "whoooeee [...] are you in for a treat", and called the two murders [...] "a doozy". Slocum call Ana Lucia [...] "a drama queen". He also felt that Libby's death was [...] "one of the most tragic things we've seen", and said that it was [...] "equivalent to a nuclear weapon wiping out all the characters in the M*A*S*H finale. Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B+. Supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Christina M. Kim were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2007 ceremony for writing the episode.|$|E
500|$|Michael's first centric {{episode in}} season two was less well received. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said [...] "it wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily {{integrated}} flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned. He did not like Michael's on-Island storyline either, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes". Three episodes later, Jensen thought Michael's [...] "whiny dad act" [...] became [...] "increasingly tedious". When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in [...] "Two for the Road", Slocum called it the [...] "single biggest shocker in Lost history". C. K. Sample of AOL's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as [...] "a brilliant move", because [...] "one of their own [...] one of them". She added it was [...] "one of [...] season's most jaw-dropping moments". According to Perrineau, it made fans [...] "pissed off" [...] with Michael. Jensen praised Perrineau's acting, saying [...] "Michael's bloody betrayal is hard to swallow, but Harold Perrineau sells it". Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts [...] "Walt!", such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad, and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly. Perrineau co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for [...] "Best Ensemble - Drama Series.|$|E

[...] {{before the end}} of the runway, travelling at a speed of , the captain ordered the first officer to rotate. [...] As the aircraft pitched upward it failed to leave the ground and the tail section struck and continued to scrape along the runway. The captain took over the controls and applied maximum thrust on all four engines by using the Take-off/Go-around (TOGA) detent. After exhausting the entire length of the runway, the aircraft failed to become airborne, and did not leave the ground until [...] beyond the end of the runway. The captain later said [...] "I thought we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> It was that close".|$|E

He underwent facial reconstruction surgeries that took months to complete, but he remained permanently disfigured and blind. To help with the costs, a fund was set up and has collected $100,700 since July 17, 2012. Poppo spoke to police, whom he thanked for saving his life, on July 19, explaining that Eugene, whom he hardly knew, approached him in a friendly manner but then, complaining he couldn't [...] "score" [...] at the beach and [...] "souped up on something", started {{to talk about how}} they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, and, suddenly and without provocation, attacked and strangled him with wrestling holds, and then [...] "plucked out" [...] both his eyes.|$|E

40|$|It is {{said the}} medical {{profession}} should learn from the aviation industry, which has a much better safety record. This is possibly because pilots get a mandatory 8 hours’ sleep. They also have to rest between shifts, for longer than the hours worked. Pilots do everything in duplicate to ensure accuracy. Most importantly, the pilots know that if their passengers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> too.

"There, there, Baas," [...] said Scowl, who was {{literally}} weeping {{tears of joy}} at my return from delirium and coma to the light of life and reason; not tears of Mameena's sort, but real ones, for I saw them running down his snub nose, that still bore marks of the eagle's claws.

60|$|Commend me {{the white}} race {{when it comes to}} grit and surviving. One of our two Japanese and both our Tahitians funked and had to be slapped on the back and cheered up and dragged along by main {{strength}} toward life.
