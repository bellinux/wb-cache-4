The results show that <b>web</b> <b>thickness,</b> t, and radius of everting stringer, r, have great influence on the performance of the keel beam. When the ratio of r/t is in the range of 4 - 6, a low peak force (peak force reduction of 50 %), stable and relative high stress plateau, and progressively crushing deformation mode can be produced from the energy-absorbing keel beam.

The specimen {{is to examine the}} behavior of shear link by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of shear link have been analyzed, namely flange and <b>web</b> <b>thicknesses,,</b> thickness and length of <b>web</b> stiffener, <b>thickness</b> of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of shear link with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase shear link performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility’s between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant.

HTPB (Hydroxyl-terminated- Polybutadiene) fuel cross linked with diisocyanate was burned with GOX under various operating conditions. Large amplitude pressure oscillations were encountered in earlier test runs. After identifying the source of instability and decoupling the GOX feed line system and combustion chamber, the pressure oscillations were drastically reduced from +/- 20 % of the localized mean pressure to an acceptable range of +/- 1. 5 %. Embedded fine-wire thermocouples indicated that the surface temperature of the burning fuel was around 1000 K depending upon axial locations and operating conditions. Also, except near the leading-edge region, the subsurface thermal wave profiles in the upstream locations arc thicker {{than those in the}} downstream locations since the solid-fuel regression rate, in general, increases with distance along the fuel slab.

A total of sixty (60) units of machine-vibrated sandcrete blocks were sampled from ten (10) manufacturers within Lagos Mainland. Three (3) samples of 450 mm x 225 mm x 225 mm blocks and another three (3) of 450 mm x 150 mm x 225 mm blocks were selected from each of the 10 manufacturers to make the total of 60 blocks. Also, a total of forty (40) units of machine-vibrated sandcrete blocks were produced based on the requirements of the NIS 87 : 2004 standards for sandcrete blocks. The blocks obtained from manufacturers as well as those produced were tested to determine their quality in terms of three parameters which were the compressive strength, density and dimensional tolerance.

To design an extremely safe system, the designer must ask {{and address the}} question "What happens when a failure occurs?" With regard to gear-tooth bending fatigue, tooth or rim fractures may occur. For aircraft, a crack that propagated through a rim would be catastrophic, leading to the disengagement of a rotor or propeller, the loss of an aircraft, and possible fatalities. This failure mode should be avoided. However, a crack that propagated through a tooth {{might or might not}} be catastrophic, depending on the design and operating conditions. Also, early warning of this failure mode might be possible because of advances in modern diagnostic systems. An analysis was performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop design guidelines to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes in the event of gear-tooth bending fatigue. The finite element method was used with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted for a variety of gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and <b>web</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> initial crack locations, and gear-tooth geometry factors such as diametral pitch, number of teeth, pitch radius, and tooth pressure angle were considered.

As the first paper in the series, this paper presents the development study {{as well as the}} calibration exercise of the proposed finite element models for simply supported composite beams. Other practical issues such as continuous composite beams, the provision of web openings for passage of building services, the partial continuity offered by the connections to columns as well as the behaviour of both unprotected and protected composite beams under fires will be reported separately. In this paper, details of the finite elements and the material models for both steel and reinforced concrete are first described, and finite element studies of composite beams with full details of test data are then presented. It should be noted that in the proposed finite element models, both steel beams and concrete slabs are modelled with two dimensional plane stress elements whose widths are assigned to be equal to the widths of concrete flanges, and the flange widths and the <b>web</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of steel beams as appropriate. Moreover, each shear connector is modelled with one horizontal spring and one vertical spring to simulate its longitudinal shear and pull-out actions based on measured load-slippage curves of push-out tests of shear connectors. The numerical results are then carefully analyzed and compared with the corresponding test results in terms of load mid-span deflection curves as well as load end-slippage curves. Other deformation characteristics of the composite beams such as stress and strain distributions across the composite cross-sections as well as distributions of shear forces and slippages in shear connectors along the beam spans are also examined in details. It is shown that the numerical results of the composite beams compare well with the test data in terms of various load-deformation characteristics along the entire deformation ranges. Hence, the proposed analysis and design tools are considered to be simple and yet effective for composite beams with practical geometrical dimensions and arrangements.
