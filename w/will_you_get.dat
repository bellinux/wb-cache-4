2500|$|In December 2009, an {{ophthalmologist}} from University Hospital Galway {{issued a}} warning {{that there had been}} a significant spike in the number of cases of solar retinopathy [...] "all of them linked to events at Knock", with the observed patients having had [...] "a significant reduction in their vision". The reports of people having observed the sun [...] "dancing in the sky" [...] were characterised as merely [...] "sort of a cheap trick" [...] caused by the extremely bright sunlight: [...] "If you stare at the sun for long enough you're going to get some visual disturbances." [...] The warning about the dangers of staring directly at the sun continued: [...] "Not only <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> reduced vision but also a condition called metamorphopsia".|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, [...] "The part is yours. Now <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all these guys off my back?" ...|$|E

500|$|As they {{continue}} to grow and mature, the girls have many disappointing encounters which leave them fearful of the loneliness that must await them in this foreign country where they struggle hopelessly to fit in and be understood. Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her {{for as long as}} she can remember. This is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> lost, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> kidnapped, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> raped, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> killed".|$|R
