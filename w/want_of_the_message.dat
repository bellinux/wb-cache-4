6000|$|The reader cannot fail to {{remember}} how severely <b>the</b> yoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman supremacy pressed both on the clergy and laity <b>of</b> England during <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Henry II. Even <b>the</b> attempt <b>of</b> that wise and courageous monarch to make a stand for <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> his throne in <b>the</b> memorable case <b>of</b> Thomas a Becket, had such an unhappy issue, that, like a suppressed rebellion, it was found to add new strength to <b>the</b> domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. Since <b>the</b> submission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king in that ill-fated struggle, <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Rome had double potency whenever it was heard, and <b>the</b> boldest peers <b>of</b> England held it more wise to submit to her imperious dictates, than to provoke a spiritual censure which had so many secular consequences. Hence the slight and scornful {{manner in which the}} Constable was treated by the prelate Baldwin struck a chill <b>of</b> astonishment into <b>the</b> assembly <b>of</b> friends whom he had collected to witness his espousals; and as he glanced his haughty eye around, he saw that many who would have stood by him through life and death in any other quarrel, had it even been with his sovereign, were turning pale at <b>the</b> very thought <b>of</b> a collision with the Church. Embarrassed, {{and at the same time}} incensed at their timidity, the Constable hasted to dismiss them, with the general assurance that all would be well--that his nephew's indisposition was a trifling complaint, exaggerated by a conceited physician, and by his own <b>want</b> <b>of</b> care--and that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop, so unceremoniously delivered, was but <b>the</b> consequence <b>of</b> their mutual and friendly familiarity, which induced them sometimes, for the jest's sake, to reverse or neglect <b>the</b> ordinary forms <b>of</b> intercourse.--"If I <b>wanted</b> to speak with the prelate Baldwin on express business and in haste, such is the humility and indifference to form of that worthy pillar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, that I should not fear offence," [...] said the Constable, [...] "did I send the meanest horseboy in my troop to ask an audience of him." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInformation is {{typically}} transmitted in telecommunication systems {{in form of}} messages. Many applications nowadays demand protection of their content and/or authentication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sender and recipient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> Message Authentication Codes are commonly used for the authentication purposes. They {{are very sensitive to}} any change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> they are appended to. If one or more bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> change, Message Authentication Codes change about 50 % of their bits, making <b>the</b> <b>message</b> useless. A successful verification of Message Authentication Codes demands that all <b>of</b> bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> received <b>Message</b> Authentication Code and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recalculated <b>Message</b> Authentication Code from <b>the</b> received <b>message</b> are equal. Such a hard condition is not suitable for some applications. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> a softer condition for the successful verification can improve <b>the</b> successful authentication <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> corrupted by transmission over a noisy channel. Algorithms are presented, which introduce robustness into <b>the</b> verification <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> protected by Message Authentication Codes, as well as an algorithm which not only verifies, but also corrects <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> corrupted due to the noisy channel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Due to <b>the</b> {{variations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{network in}} actual distributed system, failure detectors without adaptive mechanism cannot meet <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> QOS of applications.
