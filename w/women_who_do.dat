5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{factors related}} to reproductive decision-making among HIV-infected women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of HIV-infected <b>women</b> (N= 104) <b>who</b> received care at an HIV clinic in the southern United States were interviewed about their reproductive decision-making. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not become pregnant, and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> underwent a sterilization procedure subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get sterilized. RESULTS: Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get pregnant after receiving an HIV diagnosis, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant {{were more likely to}} be young, single, diagnosed earlier in the epidemic and to have more recently used a noninjecting drug. Among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get pregnant, 63 % reported their diagnosis greatly affected that decision. Having a partner who wants more children was not associated with pregnancy. Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get sterilized after learning their HIV status, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> get sterilized tended to be Baptist and already had a prior live birth. Neither a woman's desire nor her partner's desire for more children was associated with sterilization. CONCLUSIONS: HIV is an important influence on HIV-infected women's reproductive choices, regardless of the decision being made. Reproductive counseling by HIV care providers needs to be sensitive to all the issues faced by these women...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure {{hot flashes}} by sternal skin {{conductance}} {{in an urban}} Mexican population and to determine variables associated with hot flash reporting and measurement. DESIGN: From June 1999 to August 2000, 67 perimenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years participated in interviews, anthropometric measures, and a 2 -h recording of sternal skin conductance. Changes in sweating were used to demonstrate the presence/absence of a hot flash. During the test, women were asked to report if they experienced a hot flash. RESULTS: During the study period, 10 women reported and demonstrated every hot flash, 24 women never reported or demonstrated a hot flash, 7 demonstrated hot flashes but did not report any of them, 7 reported hot flashes but did not demonstrate any of them, and 19 showed a mixture of responses. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> demonstrated hot flashes by sternal skin conductance were measured in a warmer room, had more years of education, consumed more eggs as a child, recalled a heavier weight at age 18, and had a lower body mass index at interview compared with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not demonstrate hot flashes by sternal skin conductance. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> subjectively reported hot flashes were measured in a warmer room, {{were more likely to}} be postmenopausal, reported more frequent consumption of coffee, and spent fewer months breast-feeding their last child compared with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not report the experience of hot flashes during the testing period. CONCLUSION: Room temperature explained part of the variation between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not demonstrate hot flashes via sternal skin conductance, between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not report the experience of hot flashes, and between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not demonstrate concordance in objective and subjective measures. In addition to room temperature, coffee intake, months spent breast-feeding the last child, and recalled weight at age 18 were important variables predicting hot flash experience...|$|R

25|$|As {{with other}} forms of headgear, in the Commonwealth, {{academic}} caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried. In some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends {{in a number of}} universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland which have as a common theme that idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. This story is told at the University of Cambridge, Durham University, the University of Bristol, the University of St Andrews and Trinity College, Dublin among others. Indeed Newcastle University shares a similar legend as to why undergraduate academic dress do not contain a mortarboard; it is stated that the first cohort of independent Newcastle graduates from Durham University threw their hats into the River Tyne.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{argues that}} {{although}} some of these women {{may appear to be}} engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found {{that the majority of the}} women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.|$|E
