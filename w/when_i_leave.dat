500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E

Yet Yell is the Shetland I carry with me, the Shetland I pack <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave,</b> the Shetland I am impatient for when I return. It works because {{of where it}} is, an island among islands, a perfectly sealed lynchpin, which makes geographical sense of Shetland, and without which the whole archipelago would slide out of kilter and slither uncontrollably into the sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave.</b> Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E

6000|$|The General {{was silent}} a moment: Then he said [...] "Do you {{remember}} meeting {{me on the}} boat <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>leaving</b> St. Louis, after the capture of Fort Henry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} that," [...] Peter gravely said. [...] "I was in perfect good faith {{yesterday}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> took <b>leave</b> of you. <b>I</b> was--I was. But I can't--I can't: you're too unutterably dear to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Cicely rose {{to receive}} him he uttered an exclamation of irrepressible astonishment, then added, [...] "Your Highness will pardon me. Exactly thus did her royal mother stand <b>when</b> <b>I</b> took <b>leave</b> {{of her at}} Calais." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, sir," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "I {{consider}} that I have done my duty {{and finished with}} it, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you; you {{are very}} good. I am often thirsty when I waken, or rather <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> off dreaming. I seem to dream, rather than sleep, just now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you; be {{sure you}} stand by me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ask <b>leave</b> in the morning, and don't say {{anything}} till then, except to Charlie. Promise," [...] urged Rose, so eagerly, that Archie struck an attitude and cried dramatically, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, my lord,--but Johnstone {{has to go}} to London on business, and <b>I</b> promised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got <b>leave</b> that <b>I</b> wouldn't {{throw him}} over. You see,--when one has a {{profession}} one must attend to it,--more or less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>leaving</b> the office the news editor {{told me that}} a {{telegram}} had come in confirming the general illness of the Sumatra natives, and adding that the lights had not been lit in the Straits of Sunda." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My {{feeling for}} Miss Wilfer,' pursued the Secretary, without deigning to notice him, 'is {{not one to}} be ashamed of. I avow it. I love her. Let me go where <b>I</b> may <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{presently}} <b>leave</b> this house, <b>I</b> shall go into a blank life, leaving her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> was <b>leaving</b> the room, last of our party, {{he said to}} me in a quiet, well-bred voice, [...] "You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me {{the justice}} to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to {{convince}} you tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] Hallett said, mournfully, [...] "that {{about the}} time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> the army as a general, common sense will prevail; and the sword will be done away with, except on state occasions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And when shall I not think, Mary! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> off work, I shall {{want you}} for a companion; when I go to work, the thought must stir me up. Your {{judgment}} must try my own.' ...|$|E
