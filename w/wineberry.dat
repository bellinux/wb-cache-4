500|$|It {{seems that}} the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has evolved to occupy an {{ecological}} niche normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are [...] ). Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived {{in a variety of}} habitats, including tussocklands, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests dominated by podocarps (rimu, matai, kahikatea, totara), beeches, tawa, and rata. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, <b>wineberry,</b> bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas – became known as [...] "kakapo gardens".|$|E
60|$|It {{took them}} {{some time to}} deposit the various bundles of letters and packets among the <b>wineberry</b> bushes beside the trail, after which Mr. Webster shook a pound or two of loose wet sugar into the opened package. It {{appeared}} to be mixed with flour and other substances, and Harry smiled as he glanced at it.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was hot, the little <b>wineberry</b> bushes were soft, and Jimmy {{lay in a}} big hemlock's shade. A few yards in front, a falling pine had broken the row of straight red trunks, and in the gap shining snow peaks cut the serene sky. Below, the trees rolled down the hillside, and at the bottom a river sparkled. Rivers, however, were numerous, the bush on the hill-bench Jimmy had crossed was thick, and he frankly {{did not know where}} he had come down. If the hotel was in the valley, he need not bother, but he doubted, and was not keen about climbing another mountain spur. In the meantime, he smoked his pipe and mused.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wineberries</b> grow wild {{in parts}} of the United States, {{primarily}} the Appalachian Mountains. [...] They are common along the edges of fields and roadsides, but are not widely cultivated. They {{are one of the most}} easily identified wild edible plants, with no poisonous look-a-likes in North America. Other plants that <b>wineberries</b> may be mistaken for include the red raspberry, black raspberry, and blackberry, all of which are also edible. People who are just starting to learn how to gather wild food often start by gathering <b>wineberries</b> (and similar bramble fruit). Ripe berries are sweet and tart, with a raspberry-like flavor.|$|R

60|$|Nasmyth lay {{very still}} for a few moments, resting on one elbow among the <b>wineberries,</b> for she had, after all, only {{suggested}} a question that had once or twice troubled him. It was, however, characteristic of {{him that he had}} temporized, and, though he knew it must be answered some day, had thrust it aside.|$|R
60|$|Miss Deringham rose languidly, but {{her father}} felt he had {{gone as far as}} was desirable, and went back to grapple with a {{financial}} difficulty from which he could see only one escape, while she rode away with Seaforth, who led out the horse reserved for her use. Alice Deringham could ride, but when they left the clearing and plunged into the bush she found that all she had been taught in England was not much use in British Columbia. There was no perceptible trail, and the horses floundered round great fallen trees, and plunged smashing through thickets of black raspberry and barberry. In places their flanks were brushed by tall, black-stemmed fern, and where the forest was more open treacherous gravel slipped beneath the hoofs that sank from sight amidst the blood-red clusters of the little <b>wineberry.</b> After an hour of it the girl was shaken and breathless, and she contemplated her habit somewhat ruefully when Seaforth drew bridle. Somewhere far up on a hill shoulder there was a smashing in the bush.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wineberry</b> is an {{invasive}} species in North America and Europe. The non-native <b>wineberry</b> displaces native plants and alters habitat structure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wineberry</b> {{acts as a}} host to {{numerous}} associated plant species and is fed on by native birds and insects. Associated plants include a range of mosses to herbaceous plants such as Orthotrichum cyathiforme, Orthotrichum calvum, Macroacoma tenue, Leptophyllopsis laxa, and Lleostylus micranthus. The berries of A. serrata are susceptible to frugivory by both birds and mammals. Kereru are known to feed on the fruit of <b>wineberry.</b> In order to conserve Kereru populations it is suggested by DOC that <b>wineberry</b> be planted as a food source. [...] The berries of the <b>wineberry</b> {{are not the only}} thing susceptible to herbivory, the kawakawa moth larvae can be found feeding on leaves of the <b>wineberry.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth {{lay still}} among the <b>wineberries,</b> {{for a minute}} or two, and, though a cold green {{transparency}} had replaced the fires of sunset behind the tall trunks now, and the trout were splashing furiously in the pool, he forgot all about the rod beside him as he pondered over a question which had often occurred to him.|$|R
60|$|By and by {{he stopped}} in the tall fern. Not far off Margaret, holding out a bunch of corn, {{occupied}} {{the middle of an}} opening in which little red <b>wineberries</b> grew. Her pose was graceful, she did not wear a hat, and the sun was on her hair. Her neck was very white, and then her skin was delicate pink that deepened to brown. Her dress was dull blue and the yellow corn forced up the soft color.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} dark and the road bad, and Clay leaned forward in the lurching car, looking fixedly ahead. The glare of the {{headlamp}} flickered across wagon ruts and banks of tall fern that bordered the uneven track, while here and there {{the base of a}} great fir trunk flashed suddenly out of the enveloping darkness and passed. Where the bush was thinnest, Clay could see the tiny <b>wineberries</b> glimmer red in the rushing beam of light, but all above was wrapped in impenetrable gloom. They were traveling very fast through a deep woods, but the road ran straight and roughly level, and talking was possible.|$|R
50|$|Rubus phoenicolasius (Japanese <b>Wineberry,</b> wine {{raspberry}}, <b>wineberry</b> or dewberry) is an Asian {{species of}} raspberry (Rubus subgenus Idaeobatus) {{in the rose}} family. It is native to China, Japan, and Korea.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wineberry</b> {{is a quick}} growing {{deciduous}} tree. Gradually losing leaves {{during the}} winter it may become fully bare prior to new leaves and flower development in spring. <b>Wineberry</b> is an attractive tree, with pinkish foliage and rose coloured flowers in the spring. Berries ripen in the summer. As the flowers of the <b>Wineberry</b> mature they turn from white to red, there are both female and male flowers on different plants with some bisexual flowers among the males.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{hot summer}} evening, and a drowsy, {{resinous}} fragrance stole out of the shadowy bush when Nasmyth, who had now spent six months at Waynefleet's ranch, lay among the <b>wineberries</b> by the river-side. Across the strip of sliding water the sombre firs rose in a great colonnade from the grey rock's crest, with the fires of sunset blazing behind their wide-girthed trunks. The river was low and very clear, {{and the sound of}} it seemed to intensify the solemn stillness of the Bush. Nasmyth had come there to fish, after a long day of tolerably arduous labour, but he did not expect much success, though the trout rise freely just after sunset in those rivers. Indeed, he had almost forgotten that the rod and net lay near his side, for his employer's daughter sat on a fallen cedar not far away from him.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} and left him {{somewhat}} abruptly, but Nasmyth did not resume his fishing, though {{he could hear the}} big trout splashing in the pool as the sunset light faded off the water. He lay down among the <b>wineberries,</b> which were scattered among the glossy leaves like little drops of blood, to think harder than he had thought for a considerable time. An hour ago, as he had told Laura Waynefleet, he would have been well content to stay on at the ranch, and, though she had roused him, he knew that it would cost him an effort to leave it. He was not, he fancied, in love with her. Indeed, he now and then admitted that she would probably look for more from the man who won her favour than there was in him, but the camaraderie--he could think of no better word for it--that had existed between them had been very pleasant to him.|$|R
60|$|After {{that they}} set out {{together}} down the little trail that led past the willows to the lode, slipping as silently as possible through the shadows, though {{now and then a}} stone clinked beneath their feet, or a stick or twig snapped as they passed, with a sound that seemed startlingly loud. Nobody, however, seemed to hear them, and at last they sank down amidst a brake of tall fern near a little, neatly-squared stake which had been driven into the soil. The brake was in black shadow, but a broad patch of moonlight fell on the green carpet of <b>wineberries</b> a yard or two away. The rustling had ceased, and they could hear nothing for several anxious minutes; then it commenced again. A man floundering through that kind of bush makes considerable noise, even when it is daylight and he can see where he is going. Then one of the jumpers, who apparently had fallen into a clump of thorns, broke out into half-smothered expletives, and there was a soft laugh, evidently from a comrade.|$|R
50|$|Endemic to New Zealand, <b>wineberry</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} the South Island of New Zealand and lower North Island. It is common in moist forest and scrub land within the lowland, montane, and subalpine climates. <b>Wineberry</b> {{can also be found}} on Stewart Island.|$|E

60|$|The girl made no disclaimer. She was one who {{admitted}} facts, {{even when they}} did not chime with her wishes, and she still regarded Nasmyth thoughtfully. He certainly did her credit, so far as his physical appearance went, for his strength had fully come back to him, and, as he lay among the <b>wineberries</b> in an easy pose, his thin duck garments displayed the fine proportions of a figure that had been trained almost to muscular perfection by strenuous labour. The light of the paling sunset was on his bronzed face, and it revealed the elusive delicacy that characterized it. Nasmyth was certainly a well-favoured man, but there were respects in which his companion was not altogether satisfied with him. She had, as she admitted, restored him to bodily health, but, after all, that was only going so far, and she felt {{it was possible that}} she might accomplish a little more, though there was no very evident reason why she should wish to do so. Still, she was conscious of the wish.|$|R

50|$|Aristotelia serrata has a {{multitude}} of uses by both Europeans and Maori. Named Makomako, the Maori used it medically by boiling its leaves as an application to burns and infected wounds.The berries can serve as food and are often eaten by children, the berries can also be squeezed to make a thick sweet drink. <b>Wineberry</b> {{can be used in}} a variety of way to create dyes, the plant contains tannins, and the bark can provide a blue-black dye. European settlers burnt the shoots of the <b>wineberry,</b> changing the wood to charcoal for the production of gunpowder.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to seed propagation, new plants are formed from {{the tips of}} existing canes touching the ground. They enjoy moist soil and grow near and within wooded areas.As a fruit develops, it {{is surrounded by a}} protective calyx covered in hairs that exude tiny drops of sticky fluid. While the structure resembles those of carnivorous plants, the <b>wineberry</b> plant does not get nutrients from insects caught in the sap: the sticky mucilage contains no digestive enzymes, surrounding tissues cannot absorb nutrients, and there are no protein-storage tissues. Also, unlike carnivorous plants, <b>wineberry</b> grows in nutrient-rich soil, so it need not resort to insect proteins as a source of nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|Taking {{advantage}} of ecological disturbances such as natural tree falls A. serrata is plentiful in regenerating forest and damp river margins. Forest clearings which {{are followed by}} the colonization of <b>wineberry</b> are often due to land slip, storm damage, natural tree fall, forest clearings, and forest fire.|$|E
50|$|Contributing {{factors to}} the decline in {{population}} include destruction of native flora by man; invasion of exotic zarzamora blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius) and maqui <b>wineberry</b> (Aristotelia chilensis), particularly by reducing {{the extent of the}} luma trees used for nesting; predation by domestic and feral cats; and erosion by actions of introduced rabbits and goats.|$|E
50|$|Aristotelia serrata, {{also known}} as <b>wineberry,</b> is a small {{deciduous}} fast-growing tree or shrub. The tree can reach up to 10m tall, with a trunk diameter up to 30 cm.
