5|$|He {{played his}} 50th match for England in the 2010 World Cup {{qualifier}} against Belarus on 15 October 2008, {{after which he}} was credited as helping Wayne Rooney's improved form in international matches, with the two forming an effective strike partnership and keeping Owen out of the team. He started in a friendly against Spain in February 2009, which drew an angry reaction by Villa manager Martin O'Neill, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> Capello played Heskey after suffering from an injury. Heskey scored his first goal for England in six years against Slovakia, scoring England's first in a 4–0 victory at Wembley Stadium. He picked up a hamstring injury during this match, which forced him into withdrawing from the squad. He scored in a 4–0 victory over Kazakhstan in a 2010 World Cup qualifier in June 2009, which was his first competitive goal for England in seven years.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just {{before the end of}} World War II. In the war's aftermath, Americans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading {{to the creation of the}} United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval of billions of dollars in loans to rebuild Europe. Look magazine named him the second most fascinating person in the country behind Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
25|$|Bill Hamilton was {{a solitary}} man who saw {{everything}} {{through the lens}} of Darwin's theory of evolution. When he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> some ants and humans give up their life for others, he went to Waterloo station and stared at humans for hours, looking for patterns. In 1963, he realised that most of the behaviours of humans were due to genes, and he began looking at humans from the genes' point of view. Humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and it made sense for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene elsewhere could prosper.|$|E

25|$|The Army {{dropped in}} size from 3.8 million men (November 1918) to 2 million {{at the start of}} 1919, then 890,000 (November 1919) then 430,000 (November 1920). Lloyd George, wanting to spend more money on {{domestic}} programmes and concerned at persuading an electorate recently tripled in size that high defence spending was needed, launched a defence review in summer 1919 after peace was signed. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> with no major enemies on the horizon, so many more men were needed than in 1914 when the Army had numbered 255,000. Defence spending was £766m in 1919–20, this was to be reduced to £135m of which £75m was to be on the army and air force. Wilson supported the Ten Year Rule which was also formulated at this time.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted members of Congress {{to investigate the}} handling of the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> so much time and so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E

Keeler said he later received a [...] "curtly phrased" [...] letter from Tamzarian, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> his name appeared in the episode. Keeler feared he would face legal troubles, but afterwards, Tamzarian explained that he was simply curious and did not intend to scare anyone.|$|E

500|$|The {{problem with}} the targets in the Württemberg area was that they not only lay in the [...] path of the French First Army's advance, but were also in the {{occupation}} zone allocated to France. Groves attempted to get the occupation boundaries changed, but the State Department <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> first, and Groves refused to provide this information. Groves, Marshall, and Stimson then decided that the area {{would have to be}} secured by American troops that would carry off what they could and destroy everything else. Pash was sent to ask General Jacob Devers, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, if the zones of the French First Army and the U.S. Seventh Army could be swapped around. He was informed that the matter would have to be taken up with Eisenhower.|$|E
500|$|John Henry Cound Brunt {{was born}} on 6 December 1922, {{on a farm in}} Priest Weston, near Chirbury, Shropshire to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt (née Cound), and began his {{education}} at Chirbury village school. He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born 13 May 1920) and a younger sister Isobel (born 5 October 1923). When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near Whittington, Shropshire, where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic Tiny Tots, which featured instructions on [...] "How to teach yourself to swim". One day, he asked Dorothy {{to take him to the}} Shropshire Canal, which went through their farmland. Before his sister could stop him, Brunt had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal. When they finally arrived home, their mother <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim. As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the guttering of a Dutch barn [...] above the farmyard.|$|E

The secret report, known as the [...] "blue book", indicated that Seedman, not Ward, had given the order.

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob set his sons and his wives on camels {{and headed out}} toward Isaac and Canaan with all the animals and wealth that he had {{collected}} in Padan-aram. Jacob tricked Laban by fleeing secretly while Laban was out shearing his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's idols. On the third day, Laban heard that Jacob had fled {{and he and his}} kin pursued after Jacob seven days, overtaking him in the mountain of Gilead. God came to Laban in a dream and told him not to speak to Jacob either good or bad. But when Laban caught up with Jacob, he asked Jacob what he meant by carrying away his daughters secretly, like captives, without letting him kiss his daughters and grandchildren goodbye. Laban said that while he had the power to harm Jacob, God had told him the previous night not to speak to Jacob either good or bad, and now Laban <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> Jacob had stolen his gods. Jacob answered that he fled secretly out of fear that Laban might take his daughters by force, and not knowing Rachel stole the gods, he told Laban that whoever had his gods would die. Laban searched Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, and the two maid-servants' tent, finding nothing, and then he entered Rachel's tent. Rachel had hidden the idols in the camel's saddle and sat upon them, apologizing to her father for not rising, as she was having her period. Laban searched and felt about the tent, but did not find the idols. Angered, Jacob questioned Laban what he had done to deserve this hot pursuit and this searching. Jacob protested that he had worked for Laban for 20 years, through drought and frost, bearing the loss of animals torn by predators, and not eating Laban's rams, only to have his wages changed 10 times. Had not the God of Isaac been on Jacob's side, surely Laban would have sent Jacob away empty, Jacob said, and God had seen his affliction and awarded him what he deserved. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|Younghusband {{received}} a telegram from Simla, {{to attend the}} Intelligence Department (ID) {{to be interviewed by}} Foreign Secretary, Sir Mortimer Durand transferred to the Indian Political Service. [...] He served as a political officer on secondment from the British Army. [...] He refused a request to visit Lhasa as an interpreter, disguised as a Yarkandi trader, a cover not guaranteed to fool the Russians, after Scots merchant, Andrew Dalgleish had been brutally hacked to death. [...] Younghusband was accompanied by a Gurkha escort, celebrated for their ferocity in combat. [...] The Forward policy was circumscribed by a legal offer to all travellers of a peaceable security crossing borders. [...] Departure from Leh on 8 August 1889 on the caravan route took them up the mountain pass of Shimshal towards Hunza; his aim being to restore the tea trade to Xinjiang and prevent any further raids into Kashmir. [...] Colonel Durand from Gilgit joined him. [...] Younghusband probed the villages to gauge the reception: calculating it was a den of thieves, they ascended the steep ravine. [...] The Hunza was barred to them, a trap was sprung; the parley terms took him inside to negotiate. [...] The nervous reception over, they were all relieved to find safety; Younghusband <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> and who was way-laying innocent civilian traders? [...] The ruler, Safdar Ali extended a letter of welcome to his Kashmiri kingdom; the British investigated from whence came the Russian infiltrators under Agent Gromchevsky. Further south at Ladakh, he kept close watch on their movements. Reluctantly, Younghusband dined with the Cossack leaders who divulged the secrets of their common rivalry. Gromchevsky explained that the Raj had invited enmity for meddling in the Black Sea ports. The Russian displayed little grasp of strategy, but basic raw courage; he betrayed the confidence of Abdul Rahman as no friend to the British. Younghusband tentatively concluded that their possessions at Bokhara and Samarkand were vulnerable. Having drunk large quantities of vodka and brandy, the Cossacks presented arms in cordial salute and they parted in peace. Woefully unprepared for winter, the British garrison at Ladakh refused them entry.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoir, Courage and Consequence, Rove devotes three {{chapters}} to Wilson's New York Times op-ed {{and subsequent}} grand jury investigation. Rove writes that before his third {{appearance before the}} grand jury, Robert Luskin went back and looked through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight." [...] After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that [...] "it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in the shabby little room." [...] Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a [...] "target warning" [...] by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as [...] "brutal from the first moment", and that the grand jury [...] "hung on Fitzgerald's every word." [...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper. Was I lying {{about not being able to}} recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?" [...] Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> [...] "in December 2003 or January 2004 did I ask my aides...to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper." [...] It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper [...] "had insisted around Times Washington bureau that he had talked to [...]" [...] Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was [...] "stunned", and stated to Luskin, [...] "You rocked my world." [...] Rove writes that it [...] "was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day." [...] Rove also writes that in the end, Luskin had a [...] "charitable view of Fitzgerald...the prosecutor never leaked, and he treated Luskin with respect and was forthcoming about his evidence and concerns." ...|$|E
