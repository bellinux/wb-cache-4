5|$|The Chippewa {{believed}} that the least <b>weasel</b> could kill the dreaded wendigo giant by rushing up its anus. In Inuit mythology, the least <b>weasel</b> is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and whenever a mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least <b>weasel.</b> According to Matthew Hopkins, a witch hunter general during the English Civil War, least weasels were the familiars of witches.|$|E
5|$|The least <b>weasel</b> {{is small}} enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators. Least <b>weasel</b> remains {{have been found in}} the {{excrement}} of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least <b>weasel</b> include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least <b>weasel,</b> including the black rat snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least <b>weasel</b> is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin <b>weasel</b> shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} bottom trawls and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. However, {{the small size of}} this shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin <b>weasel</b> shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian <b>weasel</b> shark it is less productive and thus less resilient to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E
50|$|Kobolds often keep dire <b>weasels.</b> A warband of kobolds {{typically}} {{consists of}} 10-24 kobolds plus 2-4 dire <b>weasels.</b> A tribe of kobolds typically consists of 40-400 kobolds, plus 1 sergeant per 20 adults, 1 or 2 lieutenants, 1 leader, and 5-8 dire <b>weasels.</b>|$|R

50|$|Dire <b>weasels</b> are {{basically}} <b>weasels</b> that can grow to {{a length of}} 6 feet, and weigh up to 400 pounds.|$|R
5|$|As {{production}} of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam War by other aircraft, primarily the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began {{to return to}} the U.S. The F-105G Wild <b>Weasel</b> versions soldiered on {{until the end of the}} war. They were gradually replaced by F-4G Wild <b>Weasel</b> IVs.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian <b>weasel</b> shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian <b>weasel</b> shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least <b>weasel</b> is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The <b>weasel</b> manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E

5|$|The least <b>weasel</b> (Mustela nivalis), {{or simply}} <b>weasel</b> in the UK, is the {{smallest}} member of the genus Mustela and of the family Mustelidae (as well as {{the smallest of the}} Carnivora), native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, though it has been introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Malta, Crete, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Sao Tome, the Falkland Islands, Argentina and Chile. It is classed as being of least concern by the IUCN, due to its wide distribution and presumed large population.|$|E

40|$|Hai-Yin Wu (1999) Is there current {{competition}} between sympatric Siberian <b>weasels</b> (Mustela sibirica) and ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) in a subtropical forest ecosystem of Taiwan? Zoological Studies 38 (4) : 443 - 451. The Siberian <b>weasels</b> (Mustela sibirica) and ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) sympatric in the Guandaushi Forest {{are of particular}} interest because, with low density of rodent prey most of the time, <b>weasels</b> in this area perhaps adapt their diets and may compete with ferret badgers. Dietary and spatial relationships between the 2 carnivores were studied by scat analysis and capture-and-recapture rates from March 1995 to August 1998. Diets of allopatric populations reported by others are referenced for comparison. As expected, by switching to arthropod prey and shrews, <b>weasels</b> in Guandaushi Forest consumed food items different from <b>weasels</b> in alpine grasslands. Ferret badgers in Guandaushi and Fushan forests consumed similar diets. The dietary overlap between the sympatric <b>weasels</b> and ferret badgers was substantial; however, the occurrence frequencies of vertebrates, arthropods, and earthworms in their diets differed significantly. The major groups of arthropod prey of the 2 species differed; this {{might be related to}} their foraging behaviors. Results from preliminary trapping (March to November 1995) suggested that habitat segregation exists between <b>weasels</b> and ferret badgers in the 3 regions (A-C) which differ in habitat types. This pattern was confirmed in the main study period. More <b>weasels</b> were captured in region A than in the other regions, while a reversed pattern was observed for ferret badgers...|$|R
50|$|The <b>weasels</b> set out {{to search}} for this egg, with the stoats in hot pursuit. Prince Poynt has also employs a {{mercenary}} fox, Magellan, to hunt down the <b>weasels</b> and bring Sylver to Castle Rayn.|$|R
5|$|The least <b>weasel</b> {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least <b>weasel</b> emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the <b>weasel</b> is fatal, a {{thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The <b>weasel</b> destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E
5|$|USAF Captain Leo K. Thorsness {{was awarded}} the Medal of Honor and Capt Harold Johnson the Air Force Cross for an F-105F Wild <b>Weasel</b> mission on 19 April 1967, flying F-105F, serial number 63-8301. Thorsness and Johnson {{protected}} an attempted rescue of another Wild <b>Weasel</b> crew that had been shot down, in the process destroying two MiG-17s. After running out of ammunition, Thorsness and Johnson continued to act as decoys to draw the MiGs away from the rescue aircraft.|$|E

50|$|An Air Force Iron Hand {{mission was}} similar. A {{group of four}} fighter/bombers flew in ahead of the strike package to {{suppress}} SAMs. One or more would be two-seat F-100F or F-105F Wild <b>Weasels</b> with SAM detection and analysis electronics. Initially, the fighter/bombers had to attack SAM sites with gravity bombs. When F-105F Wild <b>Weasels</b> arrived, they brought the Shrike Anti-Radiation missile for limited stand-off capability. Later, F-105G Wild <b>Weasels</b> could also be armed with the Standard ARM.|$|R
50|$|Adding to the disarray of the flak {{exploding}} below, the Iraqis threw 100-mm shells {{into the}} formations. From {{the moment the}} package approached Baghdad's air defenses, the <b>Weasels</b> engaged enemy SAM sites. However, {{there was a problem}} with the <b>Weasels</b> allocated to the mission; either because of fuel, timing, or the decision of the package commander, not all made it to Baghdad; moreover, some <b>Weasels</b> did not fire all their HARMs, which suggests that they had to leave because of fuel problems.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mustela, the least <b>weasel</b> is a {{relatively}} unspecialised form, as evidenced by its pedomorphic skull, which occurs even in large subspecies. Its direct ancestor was Mustela praenivalis, which lived in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene and Villafranchian. M. praenivalis itself was probably preceded by M. pliocaenica of the Pliocene. The modern species probably arose during the Late Pleistocene. The least <b>weasel</b> {{is the product of}} a process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The weasel's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The least <b>weasel</b> throve during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. It probably crossed to North America through the Bering land bridge 200,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{explosion}} aboard Mercure, Iéna {{and the other}} French brigs scattered, briefly pursued by <b>Weasel,</b> who chased Iéna and Mamelouck {{but was unable to}} bring them to a decisive action. The loss of the French escorts allowed Victorious to close with Rivoli unopposed and at 04:30 the two large ships began a close range artillery duel. This combat continued unabated for the next three and a half hours, both ships being severely damaged and suffering heavy casualties. Captain Talbot was struck on the head by a flying splinter and had to quit the deck, temporarily blinded, command passing to Lieutenant Thomas Peake. To assist in subduing Rivoli, Peake recalled <b>Weasel</b> to block the French ship's attempts to escape, Commander Andrew sailing his ship in front of Rivoli and repeatedly raking her.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to writing novels, Ross has also received acclaim for her screenplays. Ross's experiences at Miramax Studios later led Ross to writing, producing, and directing a comedy short — <b>Weasels</b> the Movie— with her brother. <b>Weasels</b> {{is the story}} of two lovable losers who finally find their niche as tabloid photographers, but first discover that tabloid photography is not as easy as it looks. Ross additionally voiced many of the characters for <b>Weasels</b> and the film screened in 2011 at the Boca Film Festival.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} prey selection, Siberian <b>weasels</b> are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids {{and the more}} {{polyphagous}} martens. They rarely eat reptiles, invertebrates and plants, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. Water voles are their most frequent prey in their western range, while voles and mice are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian <b>weasels</b> in the east include Daurian and Alpine pikas, and Siberian zokors. In local areas, chipmunks, muskrats, red squirrels and jerboas are eaten. Fish may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In Ussuriland, they may scavenge extensively on the kills of wolves and yellow-throated martens during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and amphibians are typically eaten at {{the periphery of the}} Siberian <b>weasel's</b> range. Plant foods known to be eaten by Siberian <b>weasels</b> include pine nuts and actinidia fruits. They typically eat about 100-120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food. In urban areas in China, Siberian <b>weasels</b> prey extensively on rats. They are capable of single-handedly killing and dragging the largest fowls. In contrast to sables, which are ambush predators, Siberian <b>weasels</b> are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.|$|R

5|$|On 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G Wild <b>Weasel</b> Vs and six RF-4Cs were {{deployed}} to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, for Operation Desert Storm. The F-4G {{was the only}} aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, and was needed to protect coalition aircraft from Iraq's extensive air defense system. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera, and was used {{for a variety of}} reconnaissance missions. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild <b>Weasel</b> Vs from 561st Fighter Squadron, were retired on 26 March 1996. The last operational flight of the F-4G Wild <b>Weasel</b> was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996. The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG.|$|E
5|$|Spending most of {{its time}} close to the sea floor, the sicklefin <b>weasel</b> shark is a {{specialist}} predator of cephalopods. Its reproductive mode is viviparous, in which the unborn young form a placental connection to their mother. Females probably give birth twice a year, with each litter consisting of two to four pups. The sicklefin <b>weasel</b> shark is widely caught by artisanal fisheries and used for meat, fins, and fishmeal; its low natural abundance and reproductive rate mean that it cannot sustain much fishing pressure. Given that fishing activity is intense throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
