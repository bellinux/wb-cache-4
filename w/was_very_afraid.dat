25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters do not say how Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says that she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>afraid,</b> but would not take {{one of her own}} people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E

50|$|Dam Relay Race: The {{players were}} taken to the Yate Dam, and told to {{traverse}} a gap, 75 meters in elevation and bridged by two ropes. The players were to walk the rope, grasping the top one for balance, and get {{from one side to the}} other. The catch was that they were also wearing heart rate monitors, and each time their heart rates went above 160 beats per minute, they were forced to stop in place and wait for their heart rate to go down. They were given an hour for all of them to go down the ladder, cross the gap, and climb the ladder on the side. If the team decided someones heart rate was hopelessly too high, they could pull them out, but it would incur a 10-minute penalty, and all time that was taken to that point would also count. It was worth $10,000. Josh and Petrina were stopped several times while on the rope, with Petrina not even making it across - the group decided to pull her out. Shaun was stopped twice, and Nathan once; everyone else made it across without incident. The last player was Kris, who <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> of the assignment and her heart rate topped 160 on the ladder and in climbing over the ledge and onto the wire. Just as she was about to continue on the rope, time for the challenge ran out.|$|E
5000|$|Izolda Kiec (b. 1965), {{the author}} of the 1994 book on Ginczanka, was able to track down a person who was in direct contact with Ginczanka after her last arrest in the autumn of 1944. This person is a woman named Krystyna Garlicka, the sister of the Polish writer Tadeusz Breza (19051970), who resided in 1992 in Paris. Krystyna Garlicka was {{apparently}} incarcerated at one point together with Ginczanka, in the same cell, and as a fellow-prisoner developed a rapport with her which made her privy to Ginczanka's confessions and much of her ultimate fate unknown to outsiders. According to Garlicka's report given to Kiec in 1992, 47 years after the fact, Ginczanka accepted her in prison because she was acquainted with her brother, Tadeusz Breza. They slept together on a single straw mattress that was spread out on the floor for the night, a time when Garlicka would listen to Ginczanka's confessions. According to Garlicka, Ginczanka told her that her final arrest was due to a betrayal by her Kraków hostess, Elżbieta Mucharska, as she herself never left the house and [...] "no one had any knowledge of her whereabouts". Ginczanka, who was at first detained in the notorious facility in the ulica Montelupich, <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> of torture (for which that prison was infamous), and to stave off attacks on her body she affected a particular concern for her hair, which she would repeatedly touch during interrogations to make small corrections to her locks, etc. This was noticed by the Gestapo interrogators, and when they came to torment her it was her hair that was selected for special treatment: she was dragged across the floor by the hair. Although she screamed in pain, she was never broken and never admitted to being Jewish. However, {{this was not the case}} with her friend (Blumka Fradis), who broke down: [...] "perhaps she lacked the courage and the willpower of Ginczanka", Garlicka comments. [...] Blumka Fradis made a confession which spelled the end of the investigations and [...] "sealed the fate for both of them". Ginczanka was apparently hoping to be deported in the aftermath to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in the first instance, and thence to Auschwitz, resolved to overcome everything and survive. This however did not happen, as she was transferred to another prison in Kraków.|$|E
30|$|In this report, {{we showed}} {{the subject with}} {{hypothalamic}} hypopituitarism which was diagnosed based on the following findings: excess and delayed reaction of ACTH in CRH load test, delayed reaction of LH and FSH in LHRH load test, poor GH reaction in arginine load test. Although we understood {{that it would be}} important to perform insulin tolerance test in order to reconfirm the dysfunction of the hypothalamus in this subject, we failed to obtain the agreement from this subject about the insulin load test due to the risk of the occurrence of hypoglycemia. It was reasonable that this subject <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> of the occurrence of hypoglycemia because she experienced severe hypoglycemia repeatedly. Therefore, we decided not to perform insulin tolerance test in this subject. The GH releasing hormone[*]+[*]arginine (GHRH[*]+[*]ARG) test is the best method to accurately evaluate GH secretion. However, according to the Japanese guideline for adult GH deficiency (The hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction study group of the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, Japan 2009), we performed arginine load test without GHRH. Therefore GH response should be considered as low because of insufficient stimulation of GH secretion. However, based upon the other various findings, we thought that such recurrent severe hypoglycemia in this subject was presumably due to hypothalamic hypopituitarism.|$|E
