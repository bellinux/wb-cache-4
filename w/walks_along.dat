5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
5|$|At a {{hotel in}} Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub) <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> a {{corridor}} up to reach a door, which he then frantically knocks on while shouting the name ″Morris″. Banton's shouts {{attract the attention of}} Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene.|$|E
5|$|From 1975 until 1982, $606 {{million of}} local and {{national}} community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, uncovering the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocating a large section of railroad underground, creating Waterplace Park and river <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall.|$|E

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> {{the wooded}} paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|Jenks' Day Off is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Mr. Jenks' who drafts a telegram to himself {{as an excuse to}} get a reprieve from boredom and his wife's requests. He <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the beach and finds a secluded spot to go swimming. A convict in women's clothing swaps his clothes with Jenks and Jenks has no choice to but to wear the discarded clothes. On his way back, Jenks answers a call for help and is mistaken for the robber. He is captured and has to explain circumstances which lead to awkward situation. Production and casting credits for the film are unknown, but likely Thanhouser staff offer possible identities of the writer and actors. The film was released on August 2, 1910 and was met with approval by the trade publication. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Many webs span {{gaps between}} objects which the spider could not cross by crawling. This {{is done by}} first {{producing}} a fine adhesive thread to drift on a faint breeze across a gap. When it sticks to a surface at the far end, the spider feels {{the change in the}} vibration. The spider reels in and tightens the first strand, then carefully <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> it and strengthens it with a second thread. This process is repeated until the thread is strong enough to support the rest of the web.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Bath Beach's {{commercial}} strip along 86th Street {{was used}} for scenes in the 1971 feature film The French Connection, in the opening credits to the popular television series Welcome Back, Kotter, and most famously in the opening scene of the 1977 feature film Saturday Night Fever. Tony Manero, the lead character (played by John Travolta), <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the sidewalk, admires shoes in a storefront window, buys two (stacked) slices of pizza through a pizzeria window-counter at Lenny's Pizza, and ends up at the hardware store where he works (based on a real hardware store on Fifth Avenue in nearby Bay Ridge). The strip was used again in 2016 for the filming of Red Hot Chili Peppers - Go Robot music video.|$|E

25|$|On {{approaching}} the semicircle from the east, a visitor <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> {{one of two}} walls (right side wall and left side wall) picturing scenes of the war experience in bas relief. As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air and sea assaults. The last scene is of a handshake between the American and Russian armies when the western and eastern fronts met in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In Yayoi Kusama’s Walking Piece (1966), a {{performance}} that was documented {{in a series}} of eighteen color slides, Kusama <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono with a parasol. The kimono suggests traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, is made to look inauthentic as it is really a black umbrella painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walks down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turns and cries without reason, and eventually walks away and vanishes from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involves the stereotypes that Asian American women continue to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation alters the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama is able to point out the stereotype in which her white American audience categorizes her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world’s largest melting pot.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi's English tutor {{and friend}} Naru gets hurt in an accident, so she {{arranges}} for {{her older brother}} to take her place in exchange for Kobayashi making him lunches. Their initial sessions are very antagonistic, with Toyo complaining about Kobayashi's lack of English skills, and Kobayashi complaining about Toyo's pickiness about food. Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not get mad at him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and because the man was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because {{they are supposed to be}} friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship. After they part ways, she <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> crying and runs into Ida, who comforts her.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Yellow" [...] was filmed at Studland Bay {{in the county}} of Dorset, South West England. The video is minimalistic, {{featuring}} only Martin singing the song as he <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the beach.

In the Kardomah Café, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins.

Directed by Steve Barron, the video shows a photographer who follows Jackson. The paparazzo never catches the singer, and when photographed Jackson fails to materialize on the developed picture. The entertainer dances his way to Billie Jean's hotel room and as he <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> a sidewalk, each tile lights up at his touch.|$|E

The music video was released on May 1, 2009. In the video, Songz sees several women along the beach, and plays volleyball with them, <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the coastline, relaxes on a parked motorcycle, and other things, however in each instance they disappear and {{turn out to be}} illusions. In a review AOL Boombox recommended the video as one to watch, commenting, [...] "The crooner admits that it gets 'lonely in this business,' which is why he needs a companion aka a 'homey' and he won't rest 'til he finds the one for him." ...|$|E
500|$|A small stream, the River Ogney, {{runs through}} the town and joins the streams [...] which flow in from Eglwys Brewis in the north-east; these then merge and become the Afon Colhuw, which meanders down the Colhuw meadows before {{discharging}} through an outfall into the sea. The Llantwit Major area is built {{on a range of}} different levels and the town itself is sloping. At the lower coastal level is the flat, glacial Colhugh Valley, marked by steep cliffs on both sides, leading to a pebble beach. The beach, located to the south of the town (...) , has the remains of an ancient old stone wall from the large Iron Age hill fort, Castle Ditches. The steep cliffs at Llantwit which allow <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the coast to St Donat's Castle and Atlantic College have undergone dramatic erosion in recent years: in many places, the rock structure has collapsed in piles, particularly on the eastern face.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. He is wearing a suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She <b>walks</b> <b>along</b> the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
