5000|$|Despite being {{described}} in various sources {{as one of}} the largest remaining pristine coral reef groups in the <b>Windward</b> <b>Island,</b> there is growing evidence that this ecosystem is being affected by non-sustainable use and natural environmental impacts.

5|$|A {{significant}} tropical wave {{with very}} little deep convection left Africa on July 22. It crossed the Atlantic, with convection associated with its southern part passing over the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> on July 28 and crossing Central America on July 31.|$|E
5|$|Upon Janet's {{formation}} {{east of the}} <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Weather Bureau {{office in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels {{in the path of}} the developing storm to exercise caution. After a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested, hurricane warnings were issued at 1600UTC on September22 for the entirety of the Lesser Antilles from Saint Lucia to Grenada, including Barbados. Storm warnings were issued for all islands in the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> from Saint Lucia south to Tobago, excluding St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All warnings in the Windward Antilles remained in effect until 1000UTC on September22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands,</b> storm warnings were issued for the ABC islands and the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela at 0200UTC on September23. After Janet passed north of the islands, all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of September25. The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed {{from a low}} level circulation on July 11, well {{to the east of}} the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands.</b> It attained a maximum strength of 30mph (45km/h), with a pressure of , though vertical wind shear from a subtropical ridge to the north caused it to dissipate on July 12.|$|E

5|$|As {{a strong}} {{tropical}} wave, Chantal {{passed through the}} <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands.</b> The island of Martinique reported sustained winds of 39miles per hour (63km/h) with gusts to 56miles per hour (91km/h). On August16, lightning from the system killed two brothers in southern Trinidad. Also on the island, heavy rainfall caused flooding and road washouts.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Barbados, St. Vincent, and Saint Lucia on August15. The following day the watches were changed to warnings, since forecasters predicted that the system would reach tropical storm status. Additional watches and warnings were also issued {{for the rest of}} <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm {{watches and}} later {{warnings}} were issued for the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> {{as far north}} as Martinique on October 13.

5|$|Hurricane Anna {{impacted}} Central America and the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> in July1961. The first {{tropical cyclone}} and first hurricane {{of the hurricane}} season, Anna developed on July20 from an easterly wave located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ) over the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands.</b> Initially a tropical storm, it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July20. Early on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued, and later on July21, Anna became a major hurricane, upon reaching Category3 intensity. After attaining peak intensity on July22, the hurricane slightly weakened while brushing the northern coast of Honduras. Further weakening occurred; when Anna made landfall in landfall in Belize (then known as British Honduras) on July24, winds decreased to 80mph (130km/h). Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands,</b> {{lightning}} caused two indirect {{deaths in}} Trinidad. Chantal dropped light to moderate rainfall across its path, most significantly in Quintana Roo in Mexico where it caused widespread mudslides. Damage in Belize totaled $4million (2001USD; $ USD), {{due to the}} combined impact of high waves, moderate winds, and rainfall. Overall damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Jerry caused minimal damage as {{it moved}} through the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique {{reported}} sustained one-minute winds of 44mph (72km/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 -1911 {{the school}} was {{restructured}} and renamed Grenada Boys’ Secondary School and was relocated to Melville Street at the present site of the Police Barracks. The new premises was officially opened on September 18, 1911 with an enrollment of 23 students. In May 1946 {{the school was}} relocated to Tanteen to wooden barracks, which previously housed the <b>Windward</b> <b>Island</b> battalion for World War II. The wooden barracks were destroyed by hurricane Ivan in 2004. The school experienced severe destruction from two fires in April and June 2005. The school’s auditorium was refurbished, through the sponsorship of DIGICEL in 2005. The {{first phase of the}} new school was constructed from 2006 to 2008 by the government of Grenada funded by the World Bank.|$|R
5000|$|The islands {{then lay}} deserted of Europeans for almost fifteen years until 1797, when the English removed by force some 5,000 [...] "Black Caribs" [...] (a mixture of African Negro and Carib and Arawak Indians) from the <b>Windward</b> <b>Island</b> of St. Vincent, and marooned {{them on the}} then empty beaches of Port Royal on Roatán." ...The {{deportees}} were taken first to the small island of Balliceaux, then to Bequia, both in the northern Grenadines. They were then dispatched by the H.M.S. Experiment to Roatan," [...] {{under the command of}} Captain Barrett. They were landed on Roatán on a stormy day of February 25, 1797. According to the Honduran historian, Durón, the British employed two men-of-war and a brigantine, landing the deportees in April, not February, in 1797.|$|R

5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily brought {{heavy rains}} and strong winds in the <b>Windward</b> <b>Islands</b> on September21, leaving {{numerous}} homes damaged and severe {{losses in the}} banana industry. Losses throughout the islands amounted to $291,000. In the Dominican Republic, despite the storm's high intensity, relatively moderate damage occurred. Three people {{were killed by the}} storm and damages amounted to $30million. Unexpected intensification of the storm led to severe impact in Bermuda. The storm caused $50million in damages and injured 16 people.|$|E
