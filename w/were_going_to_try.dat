5|$|Operation Abercrombie was {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Hardelot. Only B and C Troops {{supported}} by detachments from the Royal Engineers and the Carleton and York Regiment of Canada participated. The raid was under the overall command of Lord Lovat, {{with the objective of}} capturing prisoners and causing as much damage as possible. For this raid they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a different system to cross the channel. Instead of using Infantry Landing Ships to cross the Channel they would be taken across on Motor Gun Boats towing Assault Landing Craft (LCA). The combined force left Dover on 19 April 1942. En route, one LCA sank with the loss of two commandos who were manning a Bren gun in the bow. The raid was called off and they returned to Dover. A replacement LCA was obtained and they returned to France on 21 April. This time the crossing was uneventful and the commandos made a successful landing. However, the two commando troops were discovered cutting the barbed wire beach obstacles and German machine guns opened fire. The raiders did carry out a reconnaissance of the area but were unable to capture any prisoners. The commandos returned without loss, but one man was wounded in the leg. The smaller Canadian detachment was unable to locate the target beach and returned to Britain. After the raid there was another change in command. Lieutenant Colonel Lister left to form No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and Major Vaughan became the temporary commanding officer. Vaughan left shortly afterwards to take over command of the Commando Depot at Achnacarry and was succeeded by Lord Lovat with Major Derek Mills-Roberts becoming the 2IC.|$|E
500|$|In a July 2011 {{interview}} with Forbes.com, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick {{stated that they}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to [...] "reinvent" [...] the series, but a former teammember of Vicarious Visions has stated that as of 2012, all development of Guitar Hero {{has come to an}} end within Activision. Another source close to Vicarious Visions had reported to Kotaku that while Guitar Hero 7 was in development under an Activision studio, the game was considered a [...] "disaster". The cancelled game omitted the additional instruments and used only a guitar peripheral, redesigning the unit to include a 6-button mechanism replacing the strum bar; the resulting unit was considered too expensive to manufacture and purchase. The developers had started from scratch to try to create new characters and venues that would be more reactive to the actual songs being played, to give the feel of a music video, but ultimately this proved too much of a challenge and had to be scrapped. Further, with a limited budget, the song selection was limited to [...] "low-budget" [...] hits of the 1990s, or at times reusing songs that had previously been included in Guitar Hero games. Though the team had a two-year development cycle, it was closed down after Activision president Eric Hirshberg had seen {{the current state of the}} project at the one-year point. Daniel Dilallo, a developer for Vicarious Visions at the time of cancellation, stated that he had come up with an idea of revitalizing the series using a first-person perspective approach, and had developed a prototype that he had called Guitar Hero Live at the time, though neither Activision nor FreeStyleGames have confirmed if this prototype was used as inspiration for the revived series.|$|E
2500|$|In December Terpsichore was at Bombay {{undergoing}} repairs {{when the}} East India Company (EIC) Governor of the Bombay Presidency received a warning from the Portuguese authorities that they {{feared that the}} French <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and take Daman and Diu. [...] was also undergoing repairs at Bombay so Mackellar volunteered his services. The EIC gave him command of the 48-gun Marquis Cornwallis, and a small flotilla consisting of the East Indiaman the Upton Castle, Betsey (an armed HEIC brig), some other vessels, and 1000 troops. The expedition sailed to Daman and Diu to persuade the Portuguese governor to resist any French incursion. The governor accepted the British reinforcements, which, as it turned out, were not needed.|$|E

U-864 was a Type IX U-boat, designed for long, ocean-going voyages with limited re-supply. [...] It was on a highly sensitive, long-range, covert mission, codenamed Operation Caesar, to deliver highly sensitive technology to their wartime ally, the Empire of Japan. U-864's top-secret manifest included jet-engine parts from the German Me-262 jet fighter plane that the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to clone, missile guidance systems from Peenemünde, of the type used on the V-2 rocket, and many tonnes of mercury, a raw material that was in short supply in Japan that was vital to the industrial production of ordnance {{since it was a}} necessary component in the fabrication of detonators.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Bunker Hill {{occurred}} on June 17, 1775, {{in the early}} stages of the American Revolutionary War, when the American forces as a whole were not yet an organized army. After the Siege of Boston, the British needed to secure control of the Charlestown Peninsula overlooking Boston from the north across the Mystic River, giving them command of Boston Harbor and ultimately Boston itself. The Committee of Safety learned a few days in advance that the British <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to occupy Dorchester Heights and Charlestown Peninsula. The Patriot forces decided to take the offensive, occupy the peninsula, fortify it, and deny the British the advantage of this important and strategic location. Word of British intentions spread fast among the colonies. General Thomas Gage mistakenly assumed that taking the peninsula from untrained colonial [...] "rebels" [...] would be an easy task.|$|E
