Harrison said at the time: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> ungrateful, but why are the Beatles on the same stage as a mass of show {{business}} greats?... We're just four normal folk who have had a couple of hit records." [...] The fourth and final nationwide tour of 1963 had a duration of six weeks, and ended on 13 December 1963.|$|E
500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with {{a tone of}} incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I do {{think there should be}} some sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E

The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{began on}} August 21, 1977 and {{took place in}} Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, a premises of a former Episcopalian Church. On {{the first day of}} sessions, guitarist Johnny Ramone brought a copy of the Sex Pistols' single [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] with him, remarking that their type of music [...] "robbed" [...] the band. He emphasized that the album's sound engineer Ed Stasium needed to incorporate better production than that of the Sex Pistols, to which Stasium replied [...] "no problem". Johnny relates: [...] "These guys ripped us off and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I {{think we should have}} been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were always like 'Blink is Blink, man. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E

And that’s {{the key to this}} album, I <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> show humanity, imperfect and flawed - the album title, the way it {{was recorded}}, I <b>wanted</b> every element <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> human, then hopefully people can empathise with me rather than judging me." ...|$|R

500|$|The Mellotron {{became a}} key {{instrument}} in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They {{were aware of}} Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> similar, but concluded {{there was no other}} way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp on McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he didn't particularly want to play the Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do as a member of the band. Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to [...] "Watcher of the Skies" [...] on the album Foxtrot (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a [...] "Watcher Mix" [...] sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but doesn't feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play the instrument live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1990, Nirvana began {{planning}} {{its second}} album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig {{as a potential}} producer. Nirvana particularly liked Vig's work with Killdozer and called Vig up to tell him, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> as heavy as that record." [...] The band traveled out to Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, recording from April 2nd to 6th, 1990, [...] Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately, eight songs were recorded: [...] "Immodium" [...] (later renamed [...] "Breed"), [...] "Dive" [...] (later released as the B-side to [...] "Sliver"), [...] "In Bloom", [...] "Pay to Play" [...] (eventually renamed [...] "Stay Away" [...] and given {{a new set of}} lyrics), [...] "Sappy", [...] "Lithium", [...] "Here She Comes Now" [...] (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and Hell Volume 1), and [...] "Polly". On April 6th, [...] the band played a local show in Madison with fellow Seattle band Tad [...] [...] Vig began to mix the recordings while the band hung out in Madison, [...] giving an interview to Madison's community radio station WORT on April 7th [...] Nirvana had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain had strained his voice, forcing Nirvana to shut down recording. On April 8th the group headed to [...] Milwaukee, Wi to kick off an extensive Midwest and East Coast tour of 24 shows in 39 days[...] Vig was told that the group would come back to record more songs, but the producer did not hear anything for a while. With the band parting ways with drummer Chad Channing after the tour, additional recording was put on hold. Instead, Nirvana used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels, creating a buzz around the group.|$|E
5000|$|Guitarist and keyboardist Richard Henshall {{said the}} band <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> more [...] "elemental" [...] than their {{previous}} work, Visions.

2500|$|James' vocal {{style and}} in {{particular}} his falsetto, has often been {{compared to that of}} singers as Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Jeff Buckley and sometimes even mistaken for Chris Martin (Coldplay).

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E

[...] Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani. [...] In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles [...] "into deeper water":I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do [...] "Normina." [...] I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like a soubrette trying to do these things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence.

We felt like everyone was using that as a gimmick, and we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have it in our music anymore because of that...and also we were very much enthralled by a movie at that time, Braveheart, which was very Celtic, and that's how our album became very Celtic because we were so in love with the soundtrack of the Braveheart movie. So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way.
