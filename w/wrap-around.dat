5|$|Next, riders board an enchanted bench {{inside the}} Room of Requirement, which lifts {{off the ground}} and through the Floo Network for a journey with Harry. The ride {{combines}} real sets and animatronics with segments that use <b>wrap-around</b> projection screens.|$|E
5|$|The staff {{also decided}} against the {{traditional}} continuation of featuring <b>wrap-around</b> segments that were featured before each {{story in the}} preceding Treehouse of Horror episodes, to allow more time for the main stories.|$|E
5|$|Stela H {{dates to}} 751, {{during the reign}} of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its glyphs are {{arranged}} in a rare mat pattern, copied from Copán. The stela is executed in the <b>wrap-around</b> style. A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt, buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected <b>wrap-around</b> scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month the}} party had been moved to a house owned by a Madame de Villentroy, located {{at the corner of}} rue de l'Arsenal and rue du Rempart near the French {{government}} offices in St. Denis. Ranavalona was reportedly pleased with the two-story house, which had a large walled garden and featured a peaked roof and <b>wrap-around</b> veranda reminiscent of the traditional highland homes of Madagascar. In addition to the queen and her aunt, sister, and grand-niece, the royal household included two secretaries, a cook, a maid, three servants for Ranavalona, and several more servants for her aunt and sister. The queen's private pastor was authorized to make visits freely to the royal household.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where <b>wrap-around</b> projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{a series}} of Minimates based on the playable {{characters}} from Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds were released by Art Asylum. On July 2, 2012, Udon Entertainment announced the release of Marvel vs. Capcom: Official Complete Works, an art book consisting of promotional artwork, sketches and bonus material from the video game collaborations between Marvel and Capcom, beginning with the 1993 arcade game The Punisher to Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The book contains contributions {{from a variety of}} artists and illustrators, including Akiman, Bengus, Shinkiro, Joe Madureira, Adi Granov, Joe Ng, Long Vo, Chamba, Adam Warren and Takeshi Miyazawa. Official Complete Works made its international debut at San Diego Comic-Con on July 11, 2012, in an exclusive hardcover edition. The hardcover also featured a <b>wrap-around</b> cover designed by Udon Entertainment and Capcom artist Alvin Lee, and digitally-painted by Udon's Genzoman. A standard-format softcover was released in November 2012 by Diamond Comics.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, <b>wrap-around</b> chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
25|$|First {{there is}} hammock forest {{with a highly}} detailed, -high <b>wrap-around</b> mural {{featuring}} 50 different plants and animals located from high in the trees to under logs on the forest floor.|$|E
25|$|The Bel Air 2-door sedan used squared-off roof {{styling and}} large <b>wrap-around</b> rear window {{as opposed to}} the hardtop's swept-back design. The Bel Air 4-door Sport Hardtop still used a {{different}} roof line than did the 4-door sedan.|$|E
25|$|Safety was {{emphasized}} with <b>wrap-around</b> {{rear lights}} designed to illuminate alternate warning signals in green, yellow, and red. A built-in roll bar reinforcement {{allowed for the}} thin pillar posts and roof panel. Exterior door handles were replaced with flush, push-type door buttons.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days before}} the UK Brexit referendum, held on 23 June 2016, the DUP paid £282,000 for a four-page glossy <b>wrap-around</b> to the free {{newspaper}} Metro, which is distributed for free in major towns and cities in the British mainland, but not Northern Ireland, advocating a 'Leave' vote.|$|E
25|$|Inside, a new flat {{instrument}} panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the <b>wrap-around</b> cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100mph compared to 120mph {{in previous years}} and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.|$|E
25|$|When built, {{the driving}} cabs had {{distinctive}} <b>wrap-around</b> front windows, although these {{were replaced by}} flat, toughened glass in the 1970s to better protect drivers following some incidents of stone-throwing vandalism. Glass partitions behind the cabs allowed passengers {{in the front and}} rearmost carriages to see the drivers' view of the track. This was particularly appreciated in the scenic riverside areas around Craigendoran and Helensburgh.|$|E
25|$|The Sens went undefeated {{to start}} the season until the streak was snapped in their sixth game with a 5–3 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on October 11. In a later win against the Montreal Canadiens, rookie Nick Foligno scored his first NHL goal off a <b>wrap-around</b> attempt on goaltender Carey Price. He celebrated the goal by imitating his father Mike's {{signature}} goal celebration, a high jump.|$|E
25|$|The fotă is a richly-ornamented <b>wrap-around</b> skirt {{made out}} of a {{rectangular}} piece of woolen fabric worn at the waist. Alternately, {{it can be made}} of two pieces of woven material that cover the front of the body (like an apron) and the back. The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in Muntenia), opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia).|$|E
25|$|Buildings {{within the}} Anacostia Historic District are {{generally}} two-story brick and wood frame structures. The houses are primarily wood frame construction, {{mostly in the}} Italianate, Cottage, and Washington Row House architectural styles (although there are some homes in the Queen Anne style). Cottage-style buildings tend to have been built earlier, with Italianate structures more popular after 1870. Queen Anne-style homes tend to be clustered in Griswold's subdivision. Many of the homes feature large lawns and <b>wrap-around</b> porches.|$|E
25|$|A queued serial {{peripheral}} interface (QSPI) {{is a type}} of SPI controller that uses a data queue to transfer data across the SPI bus. It has a <b>wrap-around</b> mode allowing continuous transfers to and from the queue with only intermittent attention from the CPU. Consequently, the peripherals appear to the CPU as memory-mapped parallel devices. This feature is useful in applications such as control of an A/D converter. Other programmable features in QSPI are chip selects and transfer length/delay.|$|E
25|$|The M9A3 (the M9A2 concept {{never went}} into production) was {{released}} in 2015 {{as part of the}} Modular Handgun System trials. The main updates to the M9A3 were a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable <b>wrap-around</b> grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and 'old' M9 style, fully removable sights and a universal slide, which makes the gun convertible from decocker-safety to decocker-only mode. Additionally, the M9A3 comes with 17-round sand-resistant magazines in a beveled shape for easier reloading.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of War, the Speed Spitfire was modified to a hybrid PR Mk II with the special Merlin II being replaced by a Merlin XII driving a variable pitch de Havilland propeller, and the racing windscreen replaced by a PR <b>wrap-around</b> type. Nothing could {{be done about the}} reduced fuel capacity and it could never be used as an operational aircraft. Flown as a liaison aircraft between airfields in Britain during the war, K9834 was scrapped in June 1946.|$|E
25|$|Like Led Zeppelin's fourth album, {{neither the}} band's name nor the album title was {{printed on the}} sleeve. However, manager Peter Grant did allow Atlantic Records to add a <b>wrap-around</b> paper title band to US and UK copies of the sleeve {{that had to be}} broken or slid off to access the record. This hid the children's {{buttocks}} from general display, but still the album was either banned or unavailable {{in some parts of the}} Southern United States for several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was deemed}} successful and negotiations took place with English Electric for a production batch of 50 locomotives {{for use on}} the Eastern Region. English Electric intended to build the new batch as similar to DP2 as possible but the British Railways Board (successor to the BTC) had produced a standard locomotive cab with a flat front and headcode box and also had specific requirements relating to the engine room and other equipment. English Electric produced several alternative front-end designs including one with a <b>wrap-around</b> windscreen but the standard front-end design was eventually adopted for the class.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{deflected}} Watson's {{shot and}} Järnkrok, on the rebound, shot the puck past Matt Murray {{to give the}} Predators a 1-0 lead nearly 15 minutes into the first period of Game 4 on June 5. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby got the puck on a breakaway just over a minute later and beat Rinne on a forehand-to-backhand move to tie the game. Gaudreau scored on a <b>wrap-around,</b> after an official review, {{that proved to be}} the winning goal – cemented by Arvidsson's breakaway goal and an empty netter by Forsberg – of a 4–1 series-tying Game 4 victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 {{a radical}} {{redesign}} {{of the cockpit}} was made, prior to that year's Le Mans outing. Further work in the Bristol wind tunnel had shown that, despite {{a slight increase in}} the Cd-value, the reduction in frontal area as a consequence of removing the cockpit roof resulted in an overall reduction in the car's aerodynamic drag. Instead of the previously all-enveloping, twin-finned roof, a <b>wrap-around</b> screen and single large tailfin were employed, in a manner very similar to the 1955 Le Mans-winning Jaguar D-Type cars. The compulsory second seat was still in place, but was covered by a solid tonneau.|$|E
25|$|The LeSabre {{nameplate}} {{made its}} first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the <b>wrap-around</b> windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the Buick Special. The Buick LeSabre was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its station wagon variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Datsun {{released}} the locally produced 180B in October 1972 as a four-door sedan in Deluxe and GL trims, and a two-door SSS coupe. The engine fitted was the 1.8-liter L18 engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975. Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, cut-pile interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, rear mounted GL badge, and whitewall tyres. In early 1974, <b>wrap-around</b> front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.|$|E
25|$|The Copeland House was {{designed}} around 1873 {{by an unknown}} architect and cast in the Italianate style. Wright's 1909 remodel work included exterior and interior alterations. A new tile roof was added above the decorative brick work; the roof was removed in the 1950s because of its maintenance expenses. The work fused Wright's Prairie style with the traditional Italiante style through the building's exterior lines. The new low-pitched hip roof that Wright designed, along with the <b>wrap-around</b> porch and overhanging eaves are all elements found in the Copeland House {{which can be found}} on other Prairie style homes Wright designed. The remodeling work also replaced the original doors with doors, frame, sidelights and a transom window all of Wright's own design.|$|E
25|$|Other {{highlights}} for 1971 {{included a}} <b>wrap-around</b> instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted {{by a large}} square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a <b>wrap-around</b> windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional display units, two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment.|$|E
25|$|Mexico City {{is home to}} {{a number}} of orchestras {{offering}} season programs. These include the Mexico City Philharmonic, which performs at the Sala Ollin Yoliztli; the National Symphony Orchestra, whose home base is the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of the Fine Arts), a masterpiece of art nouveau and art decó styles; the Philharmonic Orchestra of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (OFUNAM), and the Minería Symphony Orchestra, both of which perform at the Sala Nezahualcóyotl, which was the first <b>wrap-around</b> concert hall of the world's western hemisphere when inaugurated in 1976. There are also many smaller ensembles that enrich the city's musical scene, including the Carlos Chávez Youth Symphony, the Cuarteto Latinoamericano, the New World Orchestra (Orquesta del Nuevo Mundo), the National Polytechnical Symphony and the Bellas Artes Chamber Orchestra (Orquesta de Cámara de Bellas Artes).|$|E
25|$|The new Panorama boasted a {{completely}} new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill {{at the bottom of}} the front panel, and for the first time double headlights. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis - particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and <b>wrap-around</b> windscreen of the Consort IV. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece curved glass window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, and the lights were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top rather like the rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.|$|E
25|$|The architects {{combined}} Romanesque Revival details with Queen Anne architecture {{to create}} a unique style for the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe House. As Romanesque Revival drew inspiration from traditional German architecture, it was popular among German immigrants such as Frederick Ruskaup. Vonnegut & Bohn, ethnic German Americans, drew from German influences, as evidenced by their later masterpiece, the Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus). In contrast to the neighboring store, and reflective of the houses being constructed on Dorman Street, the architects drew on the mainstream Queen Anne style for the basic massing of the house. This {{is shown in the}} asymmetrical facade, with a <b>wrap-around</b> porch and tower. The Romanesque Revival is expressed in the varied window sizes, stone detailing in the cornice and window hoods, and a stepped front gable. The interior is equally impressive, featuring inlaid floors and a cartouche above the entryways to the stairwell and dining room, all trademarks of Vonnegut & Bohn designs. The original imported stained glass windows were removed from the house in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Penguins won game three, 4–2, {{cutting their}} {{deficit in the}} series in half. Pittsburgh {{got off to a}} strong {{offensive}} start and scored first at 4:48 of the opening period when Evgeni Malkin set up Max Talbot, who fired a one-timed snapshot. Detroit answered less than two minutes later with a Henrik Zetterberg goal at 6:19 in the period. Zetterberg scored on a rebound after Ville Leino's <b>wrap-around</b> attempt was stopped by Marc-Andre Fleury. After Pittsburgh's Brooks Orpik was called for interference, Johan Franzen responding by scoring a goal at 11:33 with under ten seconds left in the penalty. Franzen's score was a one-timer that resulted after Zetterberg fed him a pass around the goal crease. While Detroit dominated the middle of the first period, at one point firing nine straight shots, the Penguins caught a break when the officials missed a penalty for too many men when Pittsburgh had inadvertently created their own powerplay, and played with six men for nearly thirty seconds. Pittsburgh then used a late holding call on Dan Cleary to set up a game tying power play goal. Defenceman Kris Letang fanned on a one-time attempt as he took a pass from Malkin, but regained control of the puck and fired a wrist shot into the net.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, <b>wrap-around</b> rear glass and skirted rear fender, {{in favor of a}} design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E
500|$|Stela J {{was erected}} by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 756 and is {{carved in the}} <b>wrap-around</b> style. It stands [...] high and {{is located in the}} {{southern}} part of the Great Plaza. The dedicatory cache consisted of a house-shaped clay box with unknown contents.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, she {{released}} It's Alright. The cover featured Ono in her famous <b>wrap-around</b> sunglasses, looking towards the sun, {{while on the}} back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son. The album scored minor chart success and airplay with the single [...] "Never Say Goodbye".|$|E
