25|$|In the {{introduction}} to the Budget of Paradoxes De Morgan explains <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by the word.|$|E
25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, {{it is helpful to}} understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 2008, Flair {{was honored}} in Congress by a {{representative}} from North Carolina, Republican Sue Myrick, who praised his career and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to the state. On September 29, 2008, {{it was announced that}} Flair's signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.|$|E

500|$|As a {{free agent}} after the 2005 season, Hoffman re-signed with the Padres after {{negotiating}} with the Cleveland Indians. Hoffman signed a $13.5 million, two-year contract that included a club option for 2008. [...] "It came down to me making a decision for my family and not disrupting what we have going on", said Hoffman. [...] "This is probably the most significant signing that I've had", said then-Padres general manager Kevin Towers. [...] "This guy is the face of our organization. I can't put into words <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to our community." ...|$|E
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Silverman {{endorsed}} Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, saying, [...] "He says <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> & {{he means}} {{what he says}} & he's not for sale." [...] She had previously introduced Sanders {{at a rally in}} Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1932 [...] "Ethnobotany of the Ojibwe Indians," [...] Huron H. Smith records, [...] "The Ojibwe {{have written}} their {{language}} {{for a longer}} time than any other Algonquin tribe and, while they employ a script in corresponding with absent members of the tribe, it has little value to the ethnologist...." [...] Smith then clarifies <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by 'script' and provides a script table in the footnotes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by [...] "satisfactory {{punishment}}," [...] {{as opposed}} to punishment that is [...] "penal," [...] is essentially the Catholic idea of penance. Aquinas refers to the practice saying, [...] "A satisfactory punishment is imposed upon penitents" [...] and defines this idea of [...] "Satisfactory Punishment" [...] (penance) as a compensation of self-inflicted pain in equal measure to the pleasure derived from the sin. [...] "Punishment may equal the pleasure contained in a sin committed." ...|$|E

2500|$|M. L. Handa, a {{professor}} of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. University of Toronto, Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by [...] "paradigm" [...] and introduces the idea of a [...] "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as [...] "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} [...] "outline", two words recur, [...] "earth" [...] and [...] "country." [...] Something of a theorist, Strabo {{explains}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by Geography and Chorography:It is the sea {{more than anything}} else that defines the contours of the land (geōgraphei) and gives it its shape, by forming gulfs, deep seas, straits and likewise isthmuses, peninsulas, and promontories; but both the rivers and the mountains assist the seas herein. It is through such natural features that we gain a clear conception of continents, nations, favourable positions of cities and all the other diversified details with which our geographical map (chorographikos pinax) is filled.|$|E
2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes is {{the importance}} of subjectivity, which {{has to do with the}} way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|E

Horses and all, they are placed in a Time Transfer chamber for return to their own time, {{but at the last}} minute Mendoza sees the cyborg Lewis enter the building. [...] Lewis had befriended Mendoza at the facility New World One and she suspected {{he was in love with}} her. [...] Lewis makes an attempt to talk to Mendoza, and tries to warn her [...] "Don't go with him!". She has no idea <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means,</b> and in any case, the transfer takes place before any more can be said.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} some {{criticism}} about the insistent tone of these words, {{on one occasion}} he explained [...] "This {{has always been the}} hope and yearning of the Jewish people – that the Messiah should come now, immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not comfortable that people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al-mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means)</b> et tzemach davud avdecha me’hera tatzmiach , and then continues ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom, that he hopes for this the entire day!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Roth, in {{his book}} Arithmetica Philosophica (published in 1608, at Nürnberg, by Johann Lantzenberger), wrote that a {{polynomial}} equation of degree n (with real coefficients) may have n solutions. Albert Girard, {{in his book}} L'invention nouvelle en l'Algèbre (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree n has n solutions, {{but he did not}} state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds [...] "unless the equation is incomplete", by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>means,</b> it is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation x4=4x−3, although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), −1+i√2, and −1−i√2.|$|E
