Theaim of this  research {{is to develop}} systems of fuel distribution monitoring online and realtime using rule base reasoning method and radio frequency identification technology. The rule-based reasoning method {{is used as a}} rule-based reasoning model used for monitoring distribution and determine rule-based safety stock. The monitoring system program is run with a web-based computer application. Radio frequency identification technology is used by utilizing radio waves as an media identification. This technology is used as a system of tracking and gathering information from objects automatically. The research data uses data of delayed distribution of fuel from fuel terminal to consumer. The monitoring technique uses the time of departure, the estimated time to arrive, the route / route passed by a fuel tanker attached to the radio frequency Identification tag. This monitoring system is carried out by the radio frequency identification reader connected online at any gas station or specified position that has been designed with study case in Semarang.

The own warehouse (OW) capacity is limited and excess inventory is stored in rented warehouse (RW). The rented warehouse has modern infra-structure facility.

The uniqueness of the optimal solution is discussed. The numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed problem. The managerial insights are deduced using sensitivity analysis.

In this study, one of the newest social-based metaheuristic methods, Parliamentary Optimization Algorithm (POA), is firstly used for automatically mining of comprehensible and accurate classification rules within datasets which have numerical attributes. Four different numerical datasets have been selected from UCI data <b>warehouse</b> and classification <b>rules</b> of high quality have been obtained. Furthermore, the results obtained from designed POA have been compared with the results obtained from four different popular classification rules mining algorithms used in WEKA. Although POA is very new and no applications in complex data mining problems have been performed, the results seem promising. The used objective function is very flexible and many different objectives can easily be added to. The intervals of the numerical attributes in the rules have been automatically found without any a priori process, as done in other classification rules mining algorithms, which causes the modification of datasets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Business {{intelligence}} {{is based on}} data warehouses. Data warehouses use a multidimensional model, which represents relevant facts and their measures according to different dimensions. Based on this model, OLAP cubes may be defined, enabling decision makers to analyze and synthesize data. Ontologies (and, more specifically, OWL ontologies) are {{a key component of}} the semantic Web. This paper proposes an approach to represent multidimensional models as OWL-DL ontologies. To this end, it presents the multidimensional metamodel, the concepts of OWL-DL, and transformation rules for mapping a multidimensional model into and OWL-DL ontology. It then illustrates application to a case study with a simplified example of a spatiotemporal data <b>warehouse.</b> The transformation <b>rules</b> are refined to deal with spatiotemporal data warehouses, applied step by step, and the resulting ontology is implemented in the Protégé ontology tool. As illustrated by the case study, our approach enables better formalization and inferencing, thanks to OWL-DL. The ontology may also be used to represent OLAP cubes on the semantic Web (with RDF), by defining these cubes as instances of the OWL-DL multidimensional ontology...|$|R
40|$|Order picking {{deals with}} the {{retrieval}} of articles from their storage locations {{in order to satisfy}} customer requests. A major issue in manual order picking systems concerns of the transformation and consolidation of customer orders into picking orders (order batching). In practice, customer orders have to be completed by certain due dates in order to avoid delay in the shipment to customers or in production. The composition of the picking orders, their processing times and the sequence according to which they are released {{have a significant impact on}} whether and to which extent given due dates are violated. This paper presents how metaheuristics can be used in order to minimize the total tardiness for a given set of customer orders. The first heuristic is based on Iterated Local Search, the second one is inspired by the Attribute-Based Hill Climber, a heuristic based on a simple tabu search principle. In a series of extensive numerical experiments, the performance of these metaheuristics is analyzed for different classes of instances. We will show that the proposed methods provide solutions which may allow for operating order picking systems more efficiently. Solutions can be improved by 46 % on average, compared to the ones obtained by standard constructive heuristics such as an application of the Earliest Due Date <b>rule.</b> <b>Warehouse</b> Management, Order Batching, Batch Sequencing, Due Dates, Iterated Local Search, Attribute-Based Hill Climber...|$|R
40|$|Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) {{processes}} {{are responsible for}} the operations taking place in the back stage of a data warehouse architecture. In a high level description of an ETL process, first, the data are extracted from the source datastores, which can be in a relational and/or a semi-structured format. In typical cases, the source datastores can be On-Line Transactional Processing (OLTP) or legacy systems, files under any format, web pages, various kinds of documents (e. g., spreadsheets and text documents) or even data coming in a streaming fashion. Typically, only the data that are different from the previous execution of an ETL process (newly inserted, updated, and deleted information) should be extracted from the sources. After this phase, the extracted data are propagated to a special-purpose area of the warehouse, called Data Staging Area (DSA), where their transformation, homogenization, and cleansing take place. The most frequently used transformations include filters and checks to ensure that the data propagated to the <b>warehouse</b> respect business <b>rules</b> and integrity constraints, as well as schema transformations that ensure that data fit the target data warehouse schema. Finally, the data are loaded to the central data warehouse (DW) and all its counterparts (e. g., data marts and views). In a traditional data warehouse setting, the ETL process periodically refreshes the data warehouse during idle or low-load, periods of its operation (e. g., every night) and has a specific time-window to complete. Nowadays, business necessities and demands require near real-time data warehouse refreshment and significant attention i...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this design {{investigation}} is the warehouse fabric of the Fort Point Channel and its potentials {{as a model for}} further development This extensive configuration of warehouses and access roads is the product of an integrated process of planning. design and building. As such, it forms a useful model for creating a cohesive urban fabric. The <b>warehouses</b> reflect the <b>rules</b> of a concise architectural language. Thus, while each building was designed separately for different clients over the span of fifty years. all work together to form an urban environment which is intense. coherent and humane. Functionally, this fabric has undergone continuous change. Some of the warehouses now accommodate small printing houses and workshops; professional offices. shops, museums, studios and loft apartments. Thus. this tightly ordered 'family' of buildings has proven to be inherently inhabitable. The model represented by the warehouse fabric embodies my own goals and strategies for redeveloping and expanding the Fort Point Channel District as a living and working neighbourhood. My thesis proposes strategies for infrastructure and building typologies which will support high density, lowrise development as an extension to the existing fabric. The new development should be flexible, yet · harmonious: specific enough to suggest a distinct, overall character but open-ended enough to allow innovation in individual buildings and changing uses over time. The method tested through this investigation is therefore a process of layering. Rather than develop highly particularized solutions for each property, strategies are applied to the site as a whole. Once such overall strategies are agreed upon, specific solutions can be developed incrementally, but 'thematically', adjusting to changing circumstances as the need arises but contributing to a coherent whole. by John Randall Dale.
