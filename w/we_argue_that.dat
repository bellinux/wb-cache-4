First, we decided to capture analytic and interactive tasks as separate dimensions (instead of focusing on a single cognitive dimension). The second decision concerns the way we capture the routine dimension. <b>We</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it might be easier to focus on specific job aspects that make those jobs nonroutine, because the concept of routine as defined by ALM (i.e. tasks that can be replaced by computers) is substantially different from everyday concepts of routine (which mainly refer to repetitiveness) and difficult to transfer directly into proper survey questions. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it might in particular be jobs involving complex tasks and jobs that are characterized by autonomy tasks that cannot be easily replaced by computers or other means of technology.|$|R

40|$|In the thesis, Fodor’s {{arguments}} against computationalism are defeated. His arguments appeal to syntactic constraints and intractability. <b>We</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> arguments based on syntactic constraints are not satisfactory.

We also discuss various approaches {{to the problem of}} abduction in a computationalist setting. <b>We</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the social solution that human everyday cognitive activity is not isotropic and Quinean is correct. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the local solution is too preliminary a proposal. We give our objections concerning the calculation of the effect to effort ratio and the claim that memory organization leads one to relevant information. Thirdly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the natural language approach is circular. Fourthly, we arguedthat the web search approach provides a partial account of finding relevant information but leaves out the key problem of evaluating the search results. Fifthly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the global workspace approach relegates {{the most important part of}} the solution to consciousness.
