500|$|Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973 in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up {{splitting}} {{time between}} the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, where {{he lived with his}} mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> was doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know what you know you can do, not <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> tells you to do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is running from." ...|$|E

He said Moss not only knows what he's doing on a play, but <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> on the field is doing as well. [...] "That's what makes them special.

Besides, had she not voluntarily abnegated his authority and affection? And <b>what</b> had <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> said about her? Why should he alone combat the opinion of all, and be at last obliged tacitly to confess the truth of all they predicted?

However, I have reason to believe they imposed upon my ignorance, because when I came to read over their collections, there was not a syllable there but <b>what</b> I and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> knew as well as themselves: therefore I grievously suspect a cheat; and that these Authors of mine stole and transcribed every word from the universal report of mankind.

2500|$|Speaking of the album's {{production}} and style, Harrell stated that {{artists such as}} Rihanna have been talking a stance and stepping away from the popular music {{of the time and}} the expectations of her label, directors and radio, stating, [...] "I don't want to make <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is making. I want to make what I want to make. I know my fans will love it because my fans are loyal to me, but if everybody else loves it, great. If they don't, at least I know, as an artist, I've done what I want to do." [...] Anti was engineered by Nathaniel Alford, Chris Godbey, Harrell, Blake Mares, Daniela Rivera and Marcos Tovar and Harrell. The album was finally mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|James H. Smith {{founded the}} label in 1988 with his younger brother, Esham, a rapper. According to Esham, {{by the time}} he had started to rap, Detroit did not have a {{prominent}} hip hop scene. Smith states that [...] "Everybody was just imitating <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> was doing". His older brother, James, encouraged him to seriously pursue a career as a rapper because of the city's limited hip hop scene. At the age of 13, Esham released his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. In 1990, Reel Life Productions reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me. It was so much better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Look Away" [...] {{entered the}} U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in September 1988 and reached number one, where it spent two weeks, in December. Champlin {{said he was}} unaware of the feat at the time. [...] "Everybody said, 'I hear your song every day,'" [...] he recalled. [...] "I go, 'What song?' I was kind of {{oblivious}} to the whole thing, busy working on new stuff. That's <b>what</b> happens. As <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> gets aware of what you're doing, you're usually about five or six tunes past it." [...] The single was certified gold in January and ranked number one on the 1989 Billboard Year-End singles chart. It also reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. [...] "Look Away" [...] peaked at number one in Canada, number 10 in the Netherlands, number 15 in Sweden, and number 20 in Belgium.|$|R
5000|$|Behavior, in {{the real}} world is an {{immediate}} and alive source of information about how we are doing and whether we are happy with {{what is going on in}} our lives. However, it is very hard to choose and to change our emotions directly. It is easier to change our thinking- to decide, for example, that we will no longer think of ourselves as victims or to decide that in our thoughts we will concentrate on what we can do rather than <b>what</b> we think <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> ought to do. Reality Therapists approach changing [...] "what we do" [...] as a key to changing how we feel and how we will work to obtain what we want. These ideas are similar to those in other therapy movements such as Re-evaluation Counseling and person-centered psychotherapy, although the former emphasizes emotional release as a method of clearing emotional hurt.|$|R

2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is pitching you and itâ€™s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
