6000|$|... "My beau Sire, <b>will</b> <b>you</b> undervalue <b>yourself?</b> <b>Will</b> <b>you</b> degrade <b>yourself?</b> I took Abbot Thorold, {{from his}} talk, to {{be a man}} who set even a higher value on himself than other men set on him.

6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} that she <b>will</b> refuse. <b>You</b> <b>yourself</b> heard what she said yesterday. All earth and all heaven should not make me doubt her, and {{certainly}} not your word, Lady Lovel. You know how it is, and you know how it must be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And why <b>will</b> not <b>you,</b> Miss Mac-Ivor, who can so well {{describe}} a happy union, why <b>will</b> not <b>you</b> be <b>yourself</b> the person <b>you</b> describe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings. [...] "Now, dear, {{what are}} your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for <b>you,</b> or <b>will</b> <b>you</b> keep <b>yourself</b> quite free for the present?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear child, why <b>will</b> <b>you</b> not be {{reasonable}} in this matter? Why <b>will</b> <b>you</b> not let <b>yourself</b> {{be guided by}} those who are older and wiser than you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear Chettam, that is {{all very}} fine, you know," [...] said Mr. Brooke. [...] "But how <b>will</b> <b>you</b> make <b>yourself</b> proof against calumny?
