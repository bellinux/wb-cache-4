25|$|In Portugal, castles are {{directly}} related with military needs {{and the state of}} continuous warfare characterised by the Reconquista. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the Douro river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very simple structure and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with granite outcrops, that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> a boom of castles due to the ever growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense.|$|E
25|$|Ethnographic {{evidence}} suggests a very fluid boundary between mobile and settled communities, {{and it is}} entirely probable that some pastoralists may have settled permanently whilst Tripoleans may have become integrated into the more mobile steppe communities. The resultant archaeological evidence certainly suggests the creation of hybrid communities. By {{the middle of the}} fourth millennium B.C. <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> the transformation of Late Tripolye groups into new cultural entities. Probably the most noted is the Usatovo culture, which occupied the territory from the lower Dniester to the mouth of the Danube... In some aspects the culture retains traditional Tripolye styles of painted wares and figures. But, in addition, there also appears...a considerable series of daggers, along with axes, awls and rings, including rings made from silver, which is a metal we would attribute to the Proto-Indo-Europeans.|$|E

25|$|The domed {{architectural}} style evolved from Bursa and Edirne. The Ulu Cami (Holy Mosque) in Bursa {{was the first}} Seljuk mosque to be converted into a domed one. Edirne (Adrianople) was the Ottoman capital between 1365 and 1453, when Istanbul (Constantinople) became the new capital, and {{it is here that}} <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> the final stages in the architectural development which culminated {{in the construction of the}} great mosques of Istanbul. The buildings constructed in Istanbul during the period between the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453 and the construction of the Istanbul Bayezid II Mosque are also considered works of the early period. Among these are the Fatih Mosque (1470), Mahmut Paşa Mosque, the tiled palace and Topkapı Palace. The Ottomans integrated mosques into the community and added soup kitchens, theological schools, hospitals, Turkish baths and tombs.|$|E
500|$|The play's [...] "greatest charm is the {{character}} of Imogen", writes Hazlitt. He observes how, in justifying her actions, [...] "she relies little on her personal charms" [...] or a prudish [...] "affected antipathy to vice" [...] but rather [...] "on her merit, and her merit is in the depth of her love, her truth and constancy." [...] Shakespeare's presentation is full and rounded. We see her beauty as observed by others (as by the villain Iachimo), but more often we see her from the inside, and are touched when, after endless nights of crying herself awake {{over the loss of}} Posthumus, she is outraged to learn (as she is falsely informed) that Some Jay of Italy [...] hath betrayed him.

500|$|In Arhanghelii, the {{implicit}} Christian lesson {{is about the}} love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community.

As Șăineanu writes: [...] "with emotion and mounting interest, <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> here the ephemeral joys and disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village." [...] The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall [...] "awkward", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a [...] "frightening human torment" [...] by Iorga. Șăineanu deplores its [...] "prolixity" [...] and arcane mining terminology. As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from the card table to see his mine collapsing, [...] "has remarkable qualities of literary vividness and vigor." [...] Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a [...] "solidly realistic novel" [...] that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its [...] "originality and newness". He sees Agârbiceanu as an [...] "unlucky" [...] novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally.|$|E

2500|$|Some would {{maintain}} that the premier animal of the Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse.

Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins [...] "horsemen," [...] the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of Macha, born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.|$|E

Barr has written: [...] "The hearing was a farce: a virtual lovefest, during which members of the Clinton Administration responded to softball questions from their colleagues in the House with superficial answers, and Republican queries were ignored or glossed over with disdain, if not outright contempt." [...] Barr called for Congress to reopen investigations, but senior House Republicans refused. In 2003 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Barr wrote: [...] "here remains time to turn back the constitutional clock and roll back excessive post-9/11 powers before we turn the corner into another Japanese internment or, closer to our own experiences, before <b>we</b> <b>witness</b> a legally sanctioned Ruby Ridge or Waco scenario." ...|$|E
