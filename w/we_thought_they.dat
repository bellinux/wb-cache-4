500|$|Scenes of Hollywood cityscapes, {{as well as}} {{shots of}} heaven {{at the end of}} the film, were {{achieved}} through the creation of miniature sets that were filmed in long shots to give the appearance that they were large and expansive. A total of 45 sets were built in total, none larger than about two square feet, with the most expensive costing $1.67. It took days to prepare these sets. Florey cut cardboard from laundered shirts and shaped them into squares while Vorkapić painted them impressionistically to resemble buildings. The elevated trains in the cityscape scenes were actually toy trains Florey purchased and mounted on pasteboard runaways. He would pull them along the track on a string with one hand while he shot the scene with the other. Movement on the miniature sets was simulated by moving lamps and casting shadows. To make the miniature sets look more realistic and to conceal defects, prisms and kaleidoscopes were placed in front of the camera lens and moved during filming, and cylinder lens systems were used and rotated during shooting to magnify the image to the desired diameter. Florey said this was useful in [...] "giving the scenes the rhythms which <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> required".|$|E
2500|$|First, rookie {{defensive}} end Mark Anderson sacked Leinart, {{causing him to}} fumble. The loose ball {{was picked up by}} Mike Brown, who returned it for a 3-yard touchdown. Later, Brian Urlacher stripped the ball from running back Edgerrin James, and Charles Tillman recovered the football and returned it for another touchdown. The Bears, now only trailing by six points, took the lead when rookie punt returner Devin Hester returned a punt for an 83-yard touchdown. The Cardinals had one final attempt to win the game, but Rackers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Bears to kneel the clock out. After the game's conclusion, Dennis Green, who was the Cardinal's coach at the time, threw his infamous [...] "They are who <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were!" [...] postgame conference. The rant became so popular, that it was featured in a Coors Light commercial the next season.|$|E
2500|$|Its musicians {{tended to}} reject the name [...] "krautrock". This was also the case for [...] "kosmische Musik" [...] ("cosmic music"), a {{marketing}} name invented by record producer Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser for krautrock bands like Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Klaus Schulze. Musicologist Julian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says [...] "Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon," [...] based {{on the way the}} music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew. For instance, while one of the main groups originally tagged as krautrock, Faust, recorded a seminal 12-minute track they titled [...] "Krautrock", they would later distance themselves from the term, saying: [...] "When the English people started talking about Krautrock, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were just taking the piss... and when you hear the so-called 'Krautrock renaissance,' it makes me think everything we did was for nothing." [...] West German's music press initially used [...] "krautrock" [...] as a pejorative, but the term lost its stigma after the music gained success in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Nobody had {{doubted that}} these {{negotiations}} {{would produce a}} form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, {{as one of the}} negotiators, Michael Collins, later admitted (and he would have known, given his leading role in the independence war), the IRA {{at the time of the}} truce was weeks, if not days, away from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. [...] "Frankly, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce – although the republicans would probably have continued the struggle in one form or another, given the level of public support. Since Lloyd George had already, after the truce had come into effect, made it clear to President of the Republic, Éamon de Valera, [...] "that the achievement of a republic through negotiation was impossible", de Valera decided not to become a member of the treaty delegation and so not to risk more militant republicans labelling him as a [...] "sellout". Yet his own proposals – published in January 1922 – fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic. Sinn Féin's abstention was unambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|While Vietnamese sources {{maintain}} an ambush was planned at Long Tan, whether they also intended attacking Nui Dat remains uncertain. The fact a large Viet Cong force {{had not been}} identified in the area before midday on 18 August suggests no such force was there, and consequently {{it could not have}} been occupying an ambush position awaiting the arrival of the reaction force from Nui Dat. Despite this, it seems likely the 5th Division had planned an ambush but were ill-prepared {{due to a lack of}} co-ordination between the morning of 17 August and the selection and occupation of the intended site. As a result, they appear to have been unready when D Company entered the plantation and were likely somewhere on its eastern edge instead. The Viet Cong were probably still conducting their reconnaissance and establishing the ambush in the vicinity of where the rubber met the jungle when the battle occurred, while the Australians may have upset their plan by moving faster than the ARVN and US troops they had previously fought. What followed then appears to have been an encounter battle as the two advancing forces clashed on open ground in a meeting engagement. An alternative explanation is that D Company approached from an unexpected direction, physically dislocating the ambush. Indeed, Thu stated [...] "...we didn't know how many... had in Nui Dat. We tried to draw them out... <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would go one way but... went the wrong way and came behind us." [...] In July 2006, David Sabben—platoon commander 12 Platoon—and Bob Buick—platoon sergeant 11 Platoon—visited the battlefield for a television story on 60 Minutes, where they met Nguyen Minh Ninh, former vice-commander D445 Battalion. Minh told them: [...] "You won. But we won also. Tactically and militarily you won—but politically, we won. In this battle you acted out of our control—you [...] from our trap." [...] According to journalist Cameron Stewart it was the first time a senior North Vietnamese officer had admitted being defeated at Long Tan.|$|E

60|$|Then we took counsel, {{and the end}} of it {{was that}} we cut a skin rug and the yak's tough hide into strips and knotted these {{together}} into two serviceable ropes, which we fastened about our middles, leaving one end loose, for <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> might help us in our descent.|$|R

60|$|The {{next morning}} we fell early to work, for the {{transportation}} of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three miles by boat to the Hispaniola, was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen.

30|$|We {{designed}} a subject test {{in order to}} study human subjects' perception of interacting with STRNG-NL.

After all, we do have many neural oscillators inside our bodies, and we use them constantly throughout our day-to-day life.|$|R

60|$|As I know, his {{own view}} {{was that it would}} be best for us four Englishmen to remain together, although, if we did so, {{whatever}} position we chose, it would be impossible for us in that darkness to keep touch with the line of camels and their loads, which were almost as important to us as our lives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{maintain}} a deeper understanding of how unestablished, professional musicians can get discovered by the music industry by communication, branding and positioning of their brand at social media. We found that fans have a greater impact on unestablished musicians than <b>we</b> previously <b>thought.</b> <b>They</b> have to create an identity for their brand, keep active on social media and engage their fans. Musical artists must maintain an ongoing dialogue to keep their fanbase, preferably with emotions involved. No fans equals minimum attention from the industry. Uniformity and professionalism is also important, because it evokes seriousness. In order to capture the industry's interest, unestablished musicians should be working on differentiating their brands from others...|$|R
60|$|The lamps swung so far {{backward}} and forward above {{the table that}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would certainly spill the oil over us {{in one of their}} wild pitches; the settees by the table slid under us as the ship rolled, so that there was no comfort, and any one who tried to walk {{from one place to another}} had to hang on to whatever he could get hold of, or be tumbled up against the tables or the wall.

60|$|Journalism is not {{personal}} enough. So far from digging out private personalities, it cannot even report the obvious personalities on the surface.

I mean the impression that they are much older than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were.

60|$|When we had groped our way {{for about}} {{a quarter of an hour}} along the passage, {{suddenly}} it took a sharp turn, or else was bisected by another, which we followed, only in course of time to be led into a third.

What all these passages are, of course I cannot say, but <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> must be the ancient workings of a mine, of which the various shafts and adits travelled hither and thither as the ore led them.

He thought likely a lion wouldn't eat his own father, if he knowed which was him, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommon hungry, and eat his mother-in-law any time. But RECKONING don't settle nothing. You can reckon till the cows come home, but that don't fetch you to no decision. So we give it up and let it drop.|$|R
60|$|Then we mounted {{high and}} sailed away, {{and pretty soon}} that black spot on the sand was out of sight, and we wouldn't ever see them poor people again in this world.

First <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>they</b> got lost, and wandered around and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death; but Tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadn't meddled with them, and so that guess wouldn't do. So at last we give it up, and judged we wouldn't think about it no more, because it made us low-spirited.|$|R
