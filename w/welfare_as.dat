5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner <b>welfare.</b> <b>As</b> the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles {{had their}} {{origins in the}} Indian {{independence}} movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed {{an important part of}} the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.|$|E

50|$|The 19th century German economist, Gustav von Schmoller, defined <b>welfare</b> {{capitalism}} <b>as</b> government {{provision for}} the welfare of workers and the public via social legislation.

50|$|The Labour and Welfare Service (Norwegian: Arbeids- og velferdsetaten) is a {{government}} agency of Norway. Together with municipal welfare agencies, it makes up the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The Labour and <b>Welfare</b> Service (<b>as</b> well as the Norwegian Labour and <b>Welfare</b> Administration <b>as</b> a whole) is led by Labour and Welfare Directorate, {{a government}} directorate located in Oslo. Its head is the Labour and Welfare Director, currently Joakim Lystad. The Labour and Welfare Service has 14,000 employees, whereas the Norwegian Labour and <b>Welfare</b> Administration <b>as</b> a whole has 19,000 employees. The service is subordinate to the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a negative externality associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade {{too much of that}} good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E
500|$|In the model, {{domestic}} {{social welfare}} {{can be defined}} as the home firm's profit net of the subsidy (the model can be extended so that social welfare includes the firm's monopoly profit as well as the wages paid to the firm's workers; the results are qualitatively the same). It can be shown that the profit function evaluated at equilibrium quantity levels is concave in s and eventually negatively sloped. As a result, there is an [...] "optimal subsidy" [...] which maximizes the domestic firm's profits and hence domestic social <b>welfare.</b> <b>As</b> it turns out, if the government sets the subsidy exactly at the optimal level, the resulting equilibrium is {{the same as that of}} the [...] "leader and follower" [...] Stackelberg model. In that case one of the firms (in this case the domestic firm) has the ability to choose its output first. This creates the ability to credibly commit to a particular action, resulting in [...] "first mover advantage". In the Brender–Spencer model, the government's subsidy creates this credible commitment even when the private firm does not have that ability.|$|E

In September he piloted a bill to reorganise the Ministries of Child Welfare and Social <b>Welfare</b> <b>as</b> the Department of Youth and Community Services; the move was designed to [...] "revitalise" [...] and re-focus welfare services, and to remove [...] "overtones of charity and paternalism" [...] inherent in the earlier titles. [...] Waddy was succeeded by Dick Healey on 3December 1973, and took over as Minister for Health from Harry Jago. On 3January 1975, he was appointed Minister for Police and Minister for Services under new Premier Tom Lewis, serving until 23January the following year. In this portfolio he sponsored {{an amendment to the}} Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Bill, including provisions to close polling booths at 6pm rather than 8pm to expedite the reporting of results, and to change the term [...] "Christian name" [...] to [...] "Given name" [...] on candidate nominations to reflect changing community attitudes. He also put through a bill to hold a referendum on whether to make daylight saving a permanent fixture in New South Wales, following trials that had commenced in 1971.|$|E
