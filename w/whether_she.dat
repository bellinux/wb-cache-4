5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York {{was better than the}} situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|Later, Bernadette {{comes to}} drives Howard and Raj home and reveals that Wil Wheaton put {{a video of}} Raj's speech on YouTube. Howard had {{previously}} claimed that {{he told her about}} every girl he had been with, but had not done so. Back at her apartment, she questions <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> can marry him. She is also upset at Penny, who originally set her up with Howard.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln's mother, Nancy, {{is widely}} {{assumed to have}} been the {{daughter}} of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln, Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. <b>Whether</b> <b>she</b> meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
2500|$|It’s {{hard to say}} <b>whether</b> <b>she’s</b> a grand {{synthesis}} of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … <b>whether</b> <b>she’s</b> an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in [...] a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of hoops (or of anything else I should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and in lieu thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.|$|R

5|$|Princess Kassandra of Troy is the story's protagonist, {{and it is}} {{told from}} her perspective. It begins when an elderly Kassandra tiredly agrees to correct the Homeric version of the Trojan War that is told by a {{traveling}} minstrel. Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles dictated by Trojan culture, and her inner turmoil over <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Though Obama {{indicated}} in January 2010 that a consensus {{had not been}} made about <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> would campaign, speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports {{that she had been}} invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.|$|E
5|$|Billie Jenkins is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{who appeared in}} the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on the WB Television Network (The WB) from 1998 to 2006. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Billie was developed in response to The WB's request for a new character, and was originally intended to expand the show {{in a new direction}} for a possible ninth season or a spin-off series. The opinions of media outlets were divided on <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> should return for a Charmed reboot or a cast reunion.|$|E

[...] Of working with Bjorlin again, Darbo said they [...] "just fell right back into it." [...] She also noted {{that in the past}} seven years, [...] "some of the things that happened to Chloe would have happened, if Nancy had been there" [...] and said [...] "However, she’s back now, and she might start taking care of those people who hurt her daughter." ...|$|R
5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gočeva {{released}} the album Makedonsko Devojče {{in collaboration with}} Macedonian composer Zlatko Origjanski. The album features elements of Macedonian traditional music and it represented {{a change in the}} musical style for the singer. According to Gočeva, the album served as an experimental work for her in order to establish <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> would be able to successfully record folk music. Makedonsko Devojče {{turned out to be a}} commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunčane Skale festival in Montenegro. Its popularity among the Macedonian public lasted for several years after its release.|$|E
5|$|In a {{secondary}} plot, male Sheriff's deputy Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) {{is given a}} promotion over female deputy Maxine Stuart (Lauren Holly) after she is asked in her interview about such things as <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was planning {{to get married and}} get pregnant in the near future. She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him.|$|E

5|$|Navajo rubbings {{are found}} in the satchel of a {{motorcyclist}} who crashed while attempting to cross the Canada–United States border.

She is shown a copy of the rubbings and is asked <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> can identify them. After the meeting, Scully explains to John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) that the rubbings are similar to ones she found on a wrecked spacecraft three years prior. Meanwhile, the motorcyclist uses an alien artifact which begins to heal the wounds from his crash.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh. She had had daughter (Mary) in 1919 and a son (Theo) in 1924, to different fathers (neither of whom was Billy Sing). She travelled to Australia during 1925 with her two children, and settled in Paddington, NSW. She adopted the surname of her son's father. She lived in New South Wales with her son's father until her death in Wollongong in the 1970s. It is not known <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had any contact with Billy after her arrival in Australia.|$|E

In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
