40|$|White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are apex predators {{that play}} an {{important}} role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, despite both their ecological importance and threatened conservation status this species is still subject to lethal control to reduce the risks of predation for recreational <b>water</b> <b>users.</b> The Shark Spotter program, pioneered in False Bay, South Africa, proposes a non-lethal alternative to reducing predation risk. This program aims to balance the needs of people with white shark conservation by actively reducing conflict between recreational <b>water</b> <b>users</b> and sharks. In this study I establish the extent of spatial overlap between white sharks and <b>water</b> <b>users</b> at two popular recreational beaches in False Bay (Fish Hoek and Muizenberg), and investigate how shark sightings (accompanied by warning flags and/or a siren) as well as attacks influence water use patterns amongst bathers, surfers and paddlers. In the period from 2006 to 2012, the total number of shark sightings recorded was 531 at Muizenberg and 322 at Fish Hoek, with a notable increase in sightings at both beaches in recent years. Shark sightings were rare in winter increasing into the spring and summer months when recreational use of the inshore was highest. Daily shark sightings peaked at midday to late afternoon at both beaches, coinciding with peak numbers of <b>water</b> <b>users.</b> The response of <b>water</b> <b>users</b> to warnings of shark presence by the Shark Spotters was only found to be significant in cases where the siren was sounded by the shark spotters, and in the absence of a siren warning flags had little impact on average numbers of <b>water</b> <b>users.</b> The occurrence of a fatal shark attack was found to a) increase response of <b>water</b> <b>users</b> to auditory warnings (when the siren is sounded) but not visual warnings (warning flags unaccompanied by a siren); and b) reduce the average number of <b>water</b> <b>users</b> present at both beaches for at least three months following the fatal incident. Annual averages of <b>water</b> <b>users</b> at Muizenberg beach also reflected this pattern, with a general reduction in water use in years with attacks compared to those without. These findings indicate that the Shark Spotter program is effective in mitigating conflict between <b>water</b> <b>users</b> and white sharks through auditory warnings and subsequent beach clearing in the event of a shark sighting; however the lack of response by <b>water</b> <b>users</b> in the absence of a siren and after long periods without an attack remains a challenge to the effectiveness of the program. The large spatial overlap between white sharks and <b>water</b> <b>users,</b> as well as the increasing number of shark sightings at both beaches, emphasises the need for continuous revision and improvement of mitigation strategies to prevent conflict between white sharks and <b>water</b> <b>users</b> in False Bay...|$|R

25|$|Overview. In rural areas, {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} services are provided by Community Owned Water Supply Organisations (COWSOs). They have been established through the local government framework of village councils following the adoption of the Water Sector Development Strategy. Out of 10,639 villages, 8,394 had a Water Committee dealing with issues in the water and sanitation sector as of 2007. The role of COWSOs is to operate and maintain the water supply systems on behalf of the community. They are expected to meet all the costs of operating and maintaining their water supply systems through charges levied on water consumers, and to contribute to the capital cost of their systems. The main source of capital investment are block grants to local government authorities, disbursed by the Regional Secretariat. There are two main types of COWSOs: Water Consumer Associations (Vikundi vya Huduma ya Maji), who are responsible for drinking water supply, and <b>Water</b> <b>User</b> Associations (Vikundi vya Watumiaji Maji), who are responsible for water resources and for solving conflicts among water users. As of 2006, 121 <b>Water</b> <b>User</b> Associations have been established.|$|E

After Egypt opened {{itself to the}} West in the 1970s, the United States, various European countries and the World Bank provided major investment financing for {{water supply and sanitation}} and for irrigation and drainage. The Gulf countries partially financed mega-projects to develop new lands for irrigation in the New Valley (supported by the United Arab Emirates) and in Northern Sinai (supported by Kuwait an Saudi Arabia). Concerning technical assistance, the Netherlands, the World Bank and UNDP played important roles in supporting successive national water master plans since the 1980s. UNDP and the National Water Research Center have developed a computer-supported Decision Support System for Water Resources, which can produce various climate change scenarios for the Nile basin and therefore help to improve water resource planning and management. USAID provided substantial support to improve irrigation infrastructure and to support <b>water</b> <b>user</b> associations. With support by USAID a layer of management - the Inspectorate level - was stripped from the MWRI administrative system, different chains of command were brought together in the form of Integrated Water Management Districts (IWMDs), and Branch Canal <b>Water</b> <b>User</b> Associations were established across around 40% of the irrigated area of Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The 1969 {{agrarian reform}} expropriated all estates above a certain size, usually 100 hectares. Most Peruvian peasants were {{independent}} smallholders and thus continued to farm their land individually after the reforms. The agrarian reform and political instability {{contributed to the}} poor performance of agriculture, since they profoundly changed the relationships of production in the countryside, disrupted the organization of productive systems on the best agricultural lands, and forced out part of the entrepreneurial capacity. The agrarian reform and the General Water Law (1969) made the existing informal water users organizations official and part of an organizational model promoted by the state. In 1989, the decree 037-89-AG (Decreto Supremo) decentralized operational, maintenance, and management of irrigation systems to <b>water</b> <b>user</b> boards (Juntas de Usuarios-WUBs). The decree aimed to incorporate private investment and spur independence and financial sustainability within <b>water</b> <b>user</b> organizations by establishing water tariffs to cover operational and maintenance costs (O). However, low tariffs and collection capacity produced insufficient financial support for WUBs to maintain and develop irrigation systems. The Peruvian Government continued to be the major actor in irrigation development which focused on the coastal region. Some 76% of investment in the coastal region between 1978 and 1982 was concentrated in three major irrigation projects at Majes (Arequipa Region), Chira-Piura (Piura Region) and Tinajones (Lambayeque Region). This trend was maintained in the 1990s.|$|E

After having changed the policies and opened the market, Vietnam was finally able to earn foreign exchange within these years and hence gain financial power. The domestic economy grew rapidly. Nowadays, irrigated agriculture is by far the largest <b>water</b> <b>user</b> and although the country is developing very fast, agriculture which is predicted to grow moderately remains to be an important employer in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Costa Rica {{is divided}} into three major {{drainage}} basins encompassing 34 watersheds with numerous rivers and tributaries, one major lake used for hydroelectric generation, and two major aquifers that serve to store 90% of the municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supply needs of Costa Rica. Agriculture is the largest <b>water</b> <b>user</b> demanding around 53% of total supplies while the sector contributes 6.5% to the Costa Rica GDP. About a fifth of land under cultivation is being irrigated by surface water. Hydroelectric power generation makes up a significant portion of electricity usage in Costa Rica and much of this comes from the Arenal dam.|$|E

25|$|Tariffs {{in rural}} areas, where they exist, are {{set at the}} local level and differ from one {{locality}} to the other. In the Hauts-Bassins Region and Cascades Region, a Federation of <b>water</b> <b>user</b> groups has set the tariff in rural areas at CFAF 500/m3 (US$1/m3). 40% of this amount is supposed to be used for operating costs at the village level and 60% is paid into funds for maintenance, renewal and new investments as well as for a support unit at the regional level. The water tariff for rural areas {{in this part of the}} country thus is higher than the national urban water tariff for residential users charged by ONEA.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003 the Ministry of Water and Electricity (MOWE) is {{responsible}} for policy and regulation of water and sanitation services. There is no separate regulatory agency for the sector. The recently established Electricity and Co-generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) only regulates privately owned desalination plants. The functions of the Ministry of Agriculture overlap with those of MOWE, since agriculture {{is by far the}} main <b>water</b> <b>user</b> in the country and contributes in the depletion of fossil aquifers on which a large share of the country’s drinking water supply depends. There is also some overlap between the two Ministries in the area of wastewater reuse. There is no Ministry of Environment in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

However, some institutions foreseen under the law, such as the River Basin Councils, remain to be created. The water law also establishes priority uses of water, re-defines <b>water</b> <b>user</b> rights, understands water as an economic good, defines sanctions, considers river basins as management units and incorporates groundwater management considerations. It is foreseen that subsidiary legislation (reglamentos) will complement the water law by specifying, for instance, the roles of each institution within the National Water Resources System.|$|E
