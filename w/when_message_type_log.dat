40|$|Eighty-four {{male and}} 84 female subjects, divided into high, moderate, and low {{groups on the}} basis of sex-role stereotyping, watched videotapes of two-person {{interactions}} where positive and negative assertive messages were sent by male and female actors to male and female receivers. Subjects rated the level of assertion and the social acceptability of each message. Results indicated that while all messages were rated as relatively assertive, negative messages were perceived as more assertive and less socially acceptable than positive ones. Subjects also rated male senders as more assertive than female senders <b>when</b> the <b>message</b> <b>type</b> was role inappropriate for the subjects but rated female senders as relatively more assertive <b>when</b> the <b>message</b> <b>type</b> was role appropriate for them. Messages from female senders were rated as more socially acceptable than messages from male senders. Finally, messages to male receivers were rated as more acceptable than messages to females, especially by male subjects when the sender was male. Thus, both sex-role stereotypes and situational expectations appear to influence perceptions of level of assertion, and more assertive messages are perceived as less socially appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Pervasive mobile technologies, {{combined}} with the ease of access to multiple communication networks, have globalized communication exchanges {{in a way that}} is unprecedented. Compelled to receive constant information updates from their ever expanding peer networks, the average person has been transformed to a hyper-connected habitué of social media. Permanently tethered to their electronic devices they traverse the social media landscape seeking engagement and en-lightenment all the while being exposed to a multitude of product and brand messages. As such, the new consumer is informed, self-motivated, and impelled by the opinions of others. Seizing the now unbridled opportunity to affect the attitudes of peers, many social customers serve as prosumers who act as influencing agents that propagate highly salient information about products and services via social channels. In order to examine use and perceptions of social media, impact on customer relationship man-agement, and overall effectiveness of different marketing strategies employed via social plat-forms, a nationwide survey of over 1, 000 business practitioners was conducted. According to the findings most participants have made a purchase decision based on information they gathered through social media as social networking site (SNS) users influence others by actively promot-ing products and services. Social media adoption was found to be a strategic imperative for con-temporary companies that can, if used expeditiously, support customer relationship management efforts; however, corporate professionals are not adequately informed with the strategies for ef-fective use of social media to support marketing and brand management efforts. Finally, <b>when</b> <b>message</b> <b>type</b> was considered word of mouth messages were recognized as having the greatest salience...|$|R

40|$|Although several {{advertising}} studies {{report that}} message repetition leads to favorable {{evaluation of the}} advertised brand, a surprisingly large number of studies fail to find this repetition effect. This article investigates {{the influence of the}} advertising context in which the ad is presented on the repetition effect. The ad context, along with the ad content and individual differences in expertise, are found to influence the type of elaboration (item-specific and relational elaboration) a message receives. Message repetition affects evaluation when the additional exposures facilitate the complementary generation of these two types of elaboration of the ad <b>message.</b> <b>When</b> either <b>type</b> of elaboration dominates or <b>when</b> the <b>message</b> recipient spontaneously generates the impoverished type of elaboration, the effect of ad repetition is not observed. These findings provide evidence for the distinct influence on evaluation of the amount and type of elaboration that an advertising message receives.

40|$|Abstract. Agent {{communication}} languages (ACLs) invoke {{speech act}} theory and define individual <b>message</b> <b>types</b> {{by reference to}} particular combinations of beliefs and desires of the speaker (feasibility preconditions). Even when the mental states are restricted to a small set of nested beliefs, {{it seems that there}} might be a very large number of different possible preconditions, and therefore a very large number of different <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> With some constraints on the mental attitude of the speaker, we enumerate the possible belief states that could serve as preconditions for individual <b>message</b> <b>types,</b> and we identify how these states correspond to different possible <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> We then compare these with FIPA’s primitive <b>message</b> <b>types.</b> Our approach clarifies the nature of core <b>message</b> <b>types</b> in an ACL, and perhaps settles issues concerning just how many, and what types of, speech acts should be seen as primitive in such languages. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{should not}} be overlooked, that when {{certain parts of the}} {{deployment}} graph are re-executed, the replayed scripts may produce new or require to consume older messages previously transmitted by other modules. In case where a replayed script needs to consume older messages previously sent by other modules, AURA keeps track of all the messages and forwards the ones required by a replayed script. What happens, though, when a replayed script produces new messages? In these cases, AURA’s behavior is affected by the type of the message: If the new <b>message</b> is of <b>type</b> Static or ACK, the message is sent by the replayed script and ignored by AURA’s Queue module. Since both <b>message</b> <b>types</b> are not affected by a script re-execution, {{there is no need to}} propagate the new messages to other, healthy deployment parts. However, <b>when</b> a Dynamic <b>message</b> is sent, the recipient module need to repeat the configuration since the receiving information changed. For example, if a Database Server script re-generated a new password and sent it to a Web Server, the latter needs to be reconfigured in order to reflect the updates. It is, now, evident, why AURA implements different <b>message</b> <b>types</b> and how these affect error-recovery. Through this mechanism, AURA’s user has the liberty to define the <b>message</b> <b>types</b> of the deployment scripts and affect the algorithm’s behavior.|$|R
