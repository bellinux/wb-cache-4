After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> at Scully.|$|E

25|$|The Acts of the Apostles {{describes}} the disciple Stephen being seized and {{brought before the}} Sanhedrin. Those who opposed Stephen persuaded false witnesses to testify that Stephen was guilty of blasphemy against Moses and against God. Stephen used the occasion of his trial to remind the Sanhedrin of the Old Testament testimony of rebellion, idolatry, and persecution of the prophets that culminated {{in the murder of}} Jesus. The crowd <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that Stephen was stoned to death.|$|E

A woman in Karlsruhe <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> at hearing this prophecy from Nibley that she chased him with a butcher's cleaver. When Nibley returned in 1945, he found many German cities had been destroyed, including the butcher's shop.|$|E

It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the Village Voice, Creative Loafing and other tabloid and alternative publications. It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in photography as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.|$|E
25|$|In 1817, Beauclerk {{played in}} a highly {{controversial}} match at Nottingham in which he captained an All-England team while Osbaldeston and Lambert were given men for Nottingham. Accusations of match-fixing were made by both sides and Beauclerk was able to produce witnesses who implicated Lambert. As a result, MCC banned Lambert from ever playing again at Lord's Cricket Ground. Osbaldeston's turn came in 1818 after he too lost his temper when beaten at single wicket by George Brown of Sussex. Osbaldeston <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that he resigned his MCC membership. Later, he repented and asked to be reinstated but Beauclerk refused his application.|$|E
25|$|In 1712, {{during the}} Kangxi Emperor's last {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} south, Yinreng, who {{was put in charge}} of state affairs during his father's absence, tried to vie for power again with his supporters. He allowed an attempt at forcing the Kangxi Emperor to abdicate when his father returned to Beijing. However, the emperor received news of the planned coup d'etat, and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that he deposed Yinreng and placed him under house arrest again. After the incident, the emperor announced that he would not appoint any of his sons as crown prince for the remainder of his reign.

25|$|When Bubna reached Geneva on 30 December 1813, its French {{commander}} promptly had a paralyzing {{stroke and}} his 1,500-man garrison quickly {{surrendered to the}} Austrians. Geneva's arsenal contained 117 heavy guns, 30 field guns and muskets for 1,000 men. Napoleon <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> {{at the loss of}} the city that he threw the prefect in prison, even though a civil commission cleared him of wrongdoing. After his coup, Bubna operated as a practically independent commander. He left Theophil Joseph von Zechmeister in charge of Geneva and captured Bourg-en-Bresse on 11 January 1814. Napoleon assigned Marshal Pierre Augereau to defend Lyon, mount a threat to the Allied south flank and recapture Geneva. On 14 January the emperor ordered Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet to send 10,000 infantry plus cavalry from the eastern Pyrenees to help Augereau.|$|E
25|$|After {{the hero}} Houyi shot down {{nine of the}} ten suns, he was {{pronounced}} king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from Xiwangmu.

She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e on every lunar fifteenth of August to commemorate Chang'e's action.|$|E
25|$|When Yu Fan {{was living}} in exile, he was still very {{concerned}} about state affairs. For example, he strongly opposed Sun Quan's idea of sending an army across the sea to attack the warlord Gongsun Yuan in Liaodong (in northeastern China). However, he did not dare to voice his opinion directly to Sun Quan, so he asked Lü Dai to help him pass his message to Sun Quan, but Lü did not. Sun Quan heard about it later and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with Yu Fan for opposing his decision that he banished Yu further south to Mengling County (猛陵縣), Cangwu Commandery (蒼梧郡), which is located in present-day Guangxi. Sun Quan sent a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, but he regretted his decision later when storms caused the fleet to sustain heavy damage and losses. He remembered Yu Fan and quickly sent messengers to Jiao Province to fetch Yu Fan back to Jianye, but Yu had already died.|$|E

25|$|He {{found it}} {{difficult}} to control the mainly Burman region of Toungoo (Taungoo), over which Ava had only nominal suzerainty. When Thinkhaya, the ruler of Toungoo, came to Ava in 1426, he was treated almost as equal by Mohnyin Thado. Mohnyin Thado tried to encircle Toungoo by making his brother the governor of Tharrawaddy, an adjacent region of Toungoo, and staying on good terms with King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Nonetheless, Thinkhaya formed an alliance with Binnya Ran, decided to raise a rebellion and laid siege to Prome. However Binnya Ran simply wanted to keep Ava occupied, and was not eager to restart a war with Ava. He sent envoys to Ava, asking for a princess of Ava as the price of alliance. Mohnyin Thado <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that he kept the envoys for three months without audience, and had to be dissuaded from killing them. He finally decided to ally with Hanthawaddy and gave his niece to the Hanthawaddy king. Toungoo remained out of his reach {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
25|$|In 270, {{the emperor}} Sun Hao was deeply grieved when his {{favourite}} concubine, Lady Wang, died of illness, so he remained indoors {{for many months}} and refused to meet his subjects. At the time, there were rumours that Sun Hao was dead and that either Sun Fen or Sun Feng (孫奉; a grandson of Sun Ce) would become the new emperor. Zhang Jun (張俊), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, believed the rumours and hoped that Sun Fen would become the new emperor, so he sent his men {{to clean up the}} tomb of Lady Zhong (Sun Fen's mother) in Yuzhang Commandery in an attempt to please Sun Fen. When Sun Hao found out, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that he had Zhang Jun arrested and executed by dismemberment. Zhang Jun's family members were also put to death. Sun Fen and his family were implicated, arrested and condemned to death. When he pleaded with Sun Hao to spare him and his five sons and allow them to live {{the rest of their lives}} as beggars, Sun Hao refused and forced them to commit suicide by consuming poison.|$|E
25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.|$|E

25|$|Cao Hong {{appears as}} a minor {{character}} in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events {{before and during the}} Three Kingdoms period. In chapter 58, Cao Hong had a rather prominent role at the Battle of Tong Pass between Cao Cao and a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui. Cao Cao had instructed Cao Hong to guard Tong Pass for ten days at all costs and not leave his post. However, after hearing taunts from the enemy for nine days, Cao Hong finally gave in to his anger and led his troops out of the pass to engage the enemy. He not only lost the battle but also lost the pass as well. Cao Cao <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with Cao Hong that he wanted to execute him for disobeying orders, but his subordinates stopped him. Later on, Cao Hong redeemed himself by risking his life to save Cao Cao, who was fleeing from the battlefield after being defeated by Ma Chao. Cao Hong blocked Ma Chao from chasing Cao Cao and duelled with him for about 100 rounds until Ma gave up and retreated. Cao Cao pardoned Cao Hong for his earlier mistake after taking into consideration how Cao Hong saved his life. There is no mention of these incidents in historical records.|$|E
