Shakers had a reputation for honesty and their products were the best of their kind.|$|E

500|$|Vegetarian meals were {{eaten in}} a [...] "communal" [...] dining area, where food was {{vulnerable}} to aggressive monkeys and crows. Accounts {{of the food}} vary, some calling it spicy while others said it was bland. Lennon described the food as [...] "lousy", while Pattie Boyd says it <b>was</b> <b>delicious.</b> Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds, whole wheat dough baked over a fire, spiced eggplant, potatoes that had been picked locally, and, for breakfast, cornflakes, toast and coffee. [...] Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses: [...] "The food was impossible for me, because I'm allergic to so many different things, so I took two suitcases with me: one of clothes and one of Heinz beans" [...] and eggs. After dinner, the musicians gathered {{on the roof of}} Harrison's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river. [...] Sometimes they listened to records and played guitar or sitar [...] while their wives gathered in one of their rooms and discussed life as the partner of a Beatle.|$|E

2500|$|The result {{brought the}} end of Fanny Cradock's {{television}} career. Mrs Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with bramble sauce and coffee cream dessert. Cradock, grimacing and acting as if {{on the verge of}} retching, claimed not to know what a bramble was, told Mrs Troake that her menu was too rich, and, though accepting that the dessert <b>was</b> <b>delicious,</b> insisted that it was not suitable. [...] "You're among professionals now, dear", she declared. She scorned Mrs Troake's use of an ingredient for being too [...] "English", and insisted that the English have never had their own cuisine, and that [...] "even the good old Yorkshire pudding comes from Burgundy".|$|E

2500|$|In 634, Byzantine {{forces were}} {{defeated}} by the Muslim army of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab and the city was renamed Baysan. The day of victory {{came to be known}} in Arabic as Yawm Baysan or [...] "the day of Baysan." [...] The city was not damaged and the newly arrived Muslims lived together with its Christian population until the 8th century, but the city declined during this period. Structures were built in the streets themselves, narrowing them to mere alleyways, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point by the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of marble for producing lime, the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery. Some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline, however. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s, Baysan's commercial infrastructure was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—on the basis of a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating {{from the time of the}} Umayyad caliph Hisham (r. 724–43).
