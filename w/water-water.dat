40|$|The <b>water-water</b> {{cycle in}} chloroplasts is the {{photoreduction}} of dioxygen to water in photosystem I (PS I) by the electrons generated in photosystem II (PS II) from water. In the <b>water-water</b> cycle, {{the rate of}} photoreduction of dioxygen in PS I is several orders of magnitude {{lower than those of}} the disproportionation of superoxide catalysed by superoxide dismutase, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water catalysed by ascorbate peroxidase, and the reduction of the resulting oxidized forms of ascorbate by reduced ferredoxin or catalysed by either dehydroascorbate reductase or monodehydroascorbate reductase. The <b>water-water</b> cycle therefore effectively shortens the lifetimes of photoproduced superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals, their interactions with the target molecules in chloroplasts, and resulting photoinhibition. When leaves are exposed to photon intensities of sunlight in excess of that required to support the fixation of CO 2, the intersystem electron carriers are over-reduced, resulting in photoinhibition. Under such conditions, the <b>water-water</b> cycle not only scavenges active oxygens, but also safely dissipates excess photon energy and electrons, in addition to downregulation of PS II and photorespiration.

Strong regulation of the <b>water–water</b> cycle enzymes at the transcript level was only partly reflected at the protein and activity levels.

40|$|Hydration water {{determines the}} {{stability}} and function of phospholipid membranes {{as well as the}} interaction of membranes with other molecules. Experiments and simulations have shown that water dynamics slows down dramatically as the hydration decreases, suggesting that the interfacial water that dominates the average dynamics at low hydration is slower than water away from the membrane. Here, based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we provide an interpretation of the slowdown of interfacial water in terms of the structure and dynamics of <b>water–water</b> and water–lipid hydrogen bonds (HBs). We calculate the rotational and translational slowdown of the dynamics of water confined in stacked phospholipid membranes at different levels of hydration, from completely hydrated to poorly hydrated membranes. For all hydrations, we analyze the distribution of HBs and find that water–lipids HBs last longer than <b>water–water</b> HBs and that at low hydration most of the water is in the interior of the membrane. We also show that <b>water–water</b> HBs become more persistent as the hydration is lowered. We attribute this effect (i) to HBs between water molecules that form, in turn, persistent HBs with lipids; (ii) to the hindering of the H-bonding switching between water molecules due to the lower water density at the interface; and (iii) to the higher probability of water–lipid HBs as the hydration decreases. Our interpretation of the large dynamic slowdown in water under dehydration is potentially relevant in understanding membrane biophysics at different hydration levels...|$|E
