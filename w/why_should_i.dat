If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> join a synagogue? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> support Israel? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E

She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing to do at the time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> be Dismayed under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post second world war era.|$|E

500|$|Known {{primarily}} for mass-market comedies, David Dhawan {{wanted to make}} Mujhse Shaadi Karogi a romantic comedy.

There's no reason for it– you've got to go sometime" [...] and closing words [...] "there is no dark side in the moon, really. [...] As {{a matter of fact}} it's all dark" [...] came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. [...] Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be [...] "trying too hard to be funny", and were not included on the album. [...] McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line [...] "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time".|$|E

A reviewer from the Ottawa Citizen said that [...] "here's also a lot to like about Break The Ice, <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Be Sad and Perfect Love". Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises."

That night, Marge prays for her husband at their bedside. Homer tries to seduce her while she is doing so, but then falls asleep suddenly and has a dream in which God personally appears to him. God is furious with Homer for forsaking his church. Homer answers that [...] "I'm not a bad guy, I work hard, and I love my kids... so <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?"

Soderbergh was not interested in depicting Guevara's personal life because he felt that [...] "everybody on these campaigns has a personal life, they all left families behind, that doesn't make him special and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> go into his personal life and nobody else's?" ...|$|E
500|$|She {{wanted to}} play the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), but Bette Davis was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director Michael Curtiz did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of Barbara Stanwyck. Warner Bros went against Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire {{production}} of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. He has been quoted as having told Jack L. Warner, [...] "She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> waste my time directing a has-been?" [...] Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test. She agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Mildred Pierce was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled film noir sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties, earning Crawford the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.|$|E

500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, but <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> care what the world thinks of me?". O'Brien {{described it as a}} trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who have no knowledge of her [...] "jealously guarded inner self".|$|E
500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I?</b> ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{returned}} to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot. Although she considered {{the role of}} Sugar Kane another [...] "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of receiving {{ten percent of the}} film's profits in addition to her standard pay. The difficulties during the film's production have since become [...] "legendary". Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, and could not remember her lines or act as directed– Curtis famously stated that kissing her was [...] "like kissing Hitler" [...] due to the number of re-takes. Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying [...] " [...] <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> worry, I have no phallic symbol to lose." [...] Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder angry by asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.|$|E

Parthiban, was ranked at number 8 in the magazine's list of the 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com included the film in its list The A to Z of Tamil Cinema. In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal." [...] Actor Rana Daggubati, {{in an interview with}} Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film Karnan) served as inspirations for his role in [...] (2015). The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|E
