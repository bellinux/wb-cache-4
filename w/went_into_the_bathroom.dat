500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track.

2500|$|The Normal Heart is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It {{addresses}} a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks {{is involved in}} is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, [...] "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior." [...] The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D.W. Moffett on stage; Kramer <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of The Normal Heart, Naomi Wolf commented, [...] "No one else on the left at that time... ever used the moral framework that is {{so much a part}} of Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully. [...] Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one's moral calling; loyalty and betrayal..." ...|$|E

60|$|She <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> bathed her face, {{and felt}} better. The dull oppression which comes {{of a bad}} night was leaving her. She leaned out of the window, revelling in the fresh air, then crossed the passage and entered her own apartment. Stertorous {{breathing}} greeted her, and she perceived that Gerald Foster had also passed {{the night in a}} chair. He was sprawling by the window with his legs stretched out and his head resting on one of the arms, an unlovely spectacle.|$|E
60|$|He <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> {{and washed}} himself. Everything he did {{gave him a}} {{grateful}} sense of pleasure, notwithstanding the misery of his position. He dipped his arms deeper into the cold water, that he might feel the delight of it a little farther. His neck he swilled time after time, {{and it seemed to}} him he laughed with pleasure as the water caught him and fell away. The towel reminded him how sore were his forehead and his neck, blistered both to a state of rawness by the sun. He touched them very cautiously to dry them, wincing, and smiling at his own childish touch-and-shrink.|$|E
60|$|She waited again. Two letters lay unopened {{on a small}} table. Suddenly she {{put down}} her pail and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> The pot of shaving-water stood {{untouched}} on the shelf, {{just as she had}} left it. She returned and knocked swiftly at her husband's door, not speaking. She waited, then she knocked again, loudly, a long time. Something in the sound of her knocking made her afraid to try again. The noise was dull and thudding: it did not resound through the house with a natural ring, so she thought. She ran downstairs in terror, fled out into the front garden, and there looked up at his room. The window-door was open--everything seemed quiet.|$|E

60|$|Two {{of these}} creatures {{came into my}} room in the early morning, through a window whose {{shutters}} I had left open, and when I woke {{one of them was}} before the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my note-book, and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying. I did not mind the one with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt me; it hurts me yet. I threw something at him, and that was wrong, for my host had told me that the monkeys were best left alone. They threw everything at me that they could lift, and then <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> to get some more things, and I shut the door on them.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{one word}} of his brief could he take in. It was all jumbled with murky images and apprehensions, and for full half an hour he {{suffered}} mental paralysis.

Nevertheless, when he rose at half-past eight and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> he had earned his grim satisfaction in this victory of will-power.

60|$|Squiffy was convinced. He {{told himself}} {{that he had never}} really {{believed}} in Peter as a living thing. It stood to reason that there couldn't really be a snake in his room. The window looked out on emptiness. His room was several stories above the ground. There was a stern, set expression on Squiffy's face as he climbed out of bed. It was the expression of a man who is turning over a new leaf, starting a new life. He looked about the room for some implement which would carry out the deed he had to do, and finally pulled out one of the curtain-rods. Using this as a lever, he broke open the topmost of the six cases which stood in the corner. The soft wood cracked and split. Squiffy drew out a straw-covered bottle. For a moment he stood looking at it, as a man might gaze at a friend on the point of death. Then, with a sudden determination, he <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> There was a crash of glass and a gurgling sound.|$|E

The length of his hair, his voice and other features led her to the conclusion that somehow there was something different. She turned on the bed-side light, saw that her companion was not her boyfriend and slapped his face. He said to her, [...] "Give me a good time tonight," [...] and took hold of her arm, but she bit him and told him to go.

When Arwood resisted by hitting Sawyer, he screamed and kicked her in the chest. Arwood's head hit either the window sill or the bathtub and rendered her unconscious. Sawyer and Lane then carried Arwood {{into the living room and}} dropped her face down on the floor. Lane started kicking Arwood in the rib area, while Sawyer walked on her back. After Sawyer beat Arwood with a leather belt, the two men put her on a sofa bed. Shano, who had been screaming for them to stop, covered Arwood's body with a blanket.|$|E

5000|$|I {{love that}} song … I {{remember}} {{we were playing}} it and I said, [...] "I'd love to play the upright bass on that." [...] And {{it was difficult to}} record, so I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> at Friar Park and the microphone was put in there. What happened was that Mal Evanscame and flushed the toilet while I was playing the bass! I did a drawing of that, and it was still there at Friar Park in that bathroom the last time I was there. - Musician and artist Klaus Voormann, 2003, recalling the recording of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] Besides Harrison, the musicians on the song were his fellow Hindu convert Gary Wright (on organ), Nicky Hopkins (piano), and the rhythm section of Voormann and Keltner - all of whom served as the core band on Material World. Behind Harrison's acoustic guitar and the sitar drone, the sparse instrumentation provides what author Elliot Huntley terms [...] "a lesson in understatement". In the search for a good sound, Voormann recorded his part, on standup bass, in one of the bathrooms at Friar Park; he remembers being interrupted during a take by longtime Beatles aide Mal Evans flushing the toilet.|$|E

50|$|On 16 October 2007, after {{yet another}} row with Jack about Diane, Victoria went off alone and got drunk. The {{teenager}} had been rifling through old newspaper clippings {{of the fire}} that killed her mother. One of the pictures was of Sarah’s lover, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont), who had been there and survived. Victoria had decided to pay Richie a visit, in a last-ditch attempt {{to find out the}} truth about the night her mother died. Richie told her he couldn't help her. Begrudgingly, Richie described the events leading up to fire, including how Jack had threatened to kill him and Sarah for their betrayal. Richie was adamant, telling Victoria it wasn't her dad. Victoria didn't believe Richie and returned to the village and was promptly sick from the alcohol. Spotting Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) down the road, she ran into a nearby garage to hide. She overheard Andy bump into Jack, who told him Victoria had not gone to school. The pair set off to look for her together. Inside the garage, a clearly disturbed Victoria spotted a petrol can. She picked it up. Victoria took the can home and doused the furniture with petrol. Moments later, Jack and Andy returned to Annie's Cottage and immediately smelled the fumes. Then they saw Victoria, poised with a lighter in her hand, ready to set the place alight. Victoria was screaming at her dad to tell her the truth about how her mother died or else they'd {{know what it feels like}} to burn. Unable to stay quiet any longer, Andy shocked Victoria by telling her that he had started the fire that led to Sarah's death. Victoria looked at her brother in horror and then fled upstairs where she fell and hurt her head badly. She was put on her bed, bleeding. Andy stayed with her while Jack <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> to soak a towel in warm water to clean his daughter’s head. He had forgotten about the petrol fumes in the house when he turned on the hot tap. The pilot light in the boiler came on and ignited the fumes. A massive explosion ripped through the house. Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor) had been walking towards the cottage and was knocked to the ground with the force of the blast. Inside Annie's Cottage, the lounge was a raging inferno, where Victoria had soaked everything in petrol. As the fire took hold, there was a second explosion. Andy and Victoria were in her bedroom and Andy smashed her window. He swept her up in his arms and carried her to the window. By now many of the villagers, including Jonny Foster (Richard Grieve), Matthew King (Matt Healy), Perdita Hyde-Sinclair (Georgia Slowe), Diane, Billy and others, were standing outside. Jonny waited below the bedroom window with his arms up, telling Andy to drop his sister down. With Victoria safe, Andy went back for Jack but a wall of fire separated them. Billy climbed a ladder, which was set up outside, and got Andy to the window where he jumped out onto a hay truck, that Matthew had hot-wired and parked under the window. Using a blanket for cover, Billy got Jack from the bathroom and out the bedroom window. As Billy was about to climb out, numerous half-empty alcohol bottles caught fire creating another explosion, which blew Billy across the room. The fire services retrieved an unconscious Billy from the house.|$|E
