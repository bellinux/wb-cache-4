5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue {{on the side}} of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> to protect it from the weather, and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E
25|$|Queso de bola or queso Ocosingo is {{produced}} only in Chiapas and is nearly unknown {{outside of the}} state. It is made with cowsâ€™ milk to which extra cream has been added. It has a strong flavor with a creamy, crumbly texture and a light yellow color. It is prepared with a <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> and after a long aging period, it produces a hard shell. This shell is often hollowed out {{to be filled with}} meat preparation, then covered in banana leaves and cooked to make a dish called queso relleno (stuffed cheese). The hard shell of Ocosingo cheese {{is similar to that of}} Edam cheese.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{antidote}} currently available for ricin poisoning, vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain A. This vaccination is effective for several months due to the body's production of antibodies to the foreign protein. In 1978 Bulgarian defector Vladimir Kostov survived a ricin attack {{similar to the one}} on Georgi Markov, probably due to his body's production of antibodies. When a ricin-laced pellet was removed from {{the small of his back}} it was found that some of the original <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> was still attached. For this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet, producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning.|$|E

Amrita sagar was carried out at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur during September 1997 to January 1998. The five materials viz., CaCl 2 @ 1 %, waxol, Benlate 500 ppm, surfactant (Jet powder) @ 6 %, thickener (corn starch) @ 6 % and their combinations were considered as coating materials. The longest shelf life was found in <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> fruits (21 days) with the lowest weight loss per finger (6. 89 %) while the shortest shelf life was recorded in Benlate treated fruits (9. 33 days). The highest weight loss was obtained in CaCl 2 treated fruits (25. 07 %). The highest percentage of total sugars was recorded in control fruits (21. 63) and the lowest in <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> fruits (18. 8) at full ripe condition. A moderate high TSS was obtained in <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> fruits (29 %) as compared to the highest TSS in Benlate treated fruits (30. 5 %) at full ripe stage.

2500|$|The female {{deposits}} {{masses of}} eggs on plants. The masses, known as ovisacs, {{are covered in}} fluffy, cottony layers of wax filaments. The ovisac can contain up to 20 shiny yellowish, pink, or amber eggs each about [...] long. The first-instar nymph is called a crawler. It is yellowish with red eyes and has a <b>wax</b> <b>coating.</b> Crawlers are active and gregarious. The female nymph resembles the adult female, while the male nymph is longer and narrower. As they develop, the female nymph progresses through more instars than the male, and the male undergoes a pre-pupal stage. The male constructs a cottony cocoon for pupation, and the female does not.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{seven years}} of {{research}} and experimentation at their Volta Laboratory, Charles Sumner Tainter, Alexander Graham Bell and Chichester Bell introduced wax as the recording medium and engraving, rather than indenting, as the recording method. In 1887, their [...] "Graphophone" [...] system, which recorded dictation on disposable cardboard tubes with a thin <b>wax</b> <b>coating,</b> was being {{put to the test}} of practical use by official reporters of the US Congress, with commercial units later being produced by the Dictaphone Corporation. After this system was demonstrated to Edison's representatives, Edison quickly resumed work on the phonograph. He settled on a thicker all-wax cylinder, the surface of which could be repeatedly shaved down for reuse. Both the Graphophone and Edison's [...] "Perfected Phonograph" [...] were commercialized in 1888. Eventually, a patent-sharing agreement was signed and the wax-coated cardboard tubes were abandoned in favor of Edison's all-wax cylinders as an interchangeable standard format.|$|E

50|$|Plants in alpine environments are {{subjected}} to water stress {{from a combination of}} inadequate precipitation, thin soils, periodic high winds and insolation. Numerous morphological adaptations are therefore situated around reducing transpirational water loss. Adaptations include thick cuticles, rolled leaf margins, sunken stomata or lacking leaves altogether. Some plants have dense hairs on the underside of their leaves or thick <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> trichomes.|$|R
2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the <b>wax</b> <b>coating.</b> In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Urea {{briquettes}} {{suffer from}} major disadvantages such as relatively rapid dissolution, high soil urea concentration around shrinking briquette and susceptibility to leaching losses. Coatings, such as kokum wax applied on the briquettes, can mitigate these problems. Concentrations of urea developed in soil, due to release from kokum <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> briquettes, were experimentally measured in silt loam soil. High soil urea concentrations as {{observed in the}} case of uncoated briquettes were not observed, thereby alleviating the ill effects of high concentration of soil urea...|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, lotion is rubbed on {{the hand}} before {{submersion}} into the paraffin bath. The hand is usually dipped more than once to allow a thicker <b>wax</b> <b>coat</b> to form, making the coating stay warm longer {{and less likely to}} break or tear prematurely. After the hands have been dipped in the wax, they are wrapped in either plastic or aluminum foil, or a special type of plastic bag or glove, then covered with a towel or special mitten to retain warmth. The hands are left for a few minutes before the paraffin is cooled and dried.|$|R
40|$|Cyclic {{changes in}} {{temperature}} and humidity in real-life distribution environments decrease BCT and life-span of standard corrugated containers. As a result, BCT obtained from testing at standard TAPPI environment may be inadequate to protect the products inside from damages during real-life distribution. The corrugated containers users need to understand this concept in order to design a proper corrugated containers at a cost-efficient price that can retain BCT in these extreme {{temperature and humidity}} changes environments. <b>Wax</b> curtain <b>coating</b> {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques to retain BCT of corrugated containers that are distributed in short-term high humidity environment, and usually found in the fresh produce, poultry and meat industries. In this study, standard and <b>wax</b> curtain <b>coated</b> corrugated containers were top-loaded with two different safety factors and conditioned in three different cyclic environments. Every 24 hours, moisture contents and heights of these loaded test containers were determined to investigate life-span and relationship between moisture content change and reduction in height. In addition, unloaded standard and <b>wax</b> curtain <b>coated</b> corrugated containers were conditioned in three different cyclic and constant environments. The reduction in BCT of these unloaded test containers in each cyclic and constant environment was investigated after the loaded test containers in that cyclic environment reached the critical deflection. The results of the experiment showed that there was a notable difference in reduction in BCT of the standard unloaded test containers after exposure to every cyclic and constant environments, but not of the <b>wax</b> curtain <b>coated</b> unloaded test containers. The life-span of loaded <b>wax</b> curtain <b>coated</b> test containers were also greater than of loaded standard test containers in every cyclic environment. The greater difference of temperature in cyclic environment resulted in greater moisture content change of corrugated material. Thus, both types of test containers experienced the greatest moisture content change in cyclic cold storage environment. However, due to its most severe temperature and relative humidity, cyclic tropical environment showed the greatest effect on reduction in BCT, reduction in height and life-span of both types of test containers...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{research}} has shown the potential use of CNTs as sensors for structural health monitoring applications. In particular, since CNTs are electrically conductive material, the addition of small amount, known as the percolation threshold, may alter the electrical conductivity of non-conductive polymer-based construction materials (Zamal 2011). For instance, Swain et al. (2012) reported improvement in the electrical properties of unsaturated polyester resin by incorporating allylester functionalized MWCNTs and silane functionalized MWCNTs. Furthermore, <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> MWCNTs enhanced the electrical conductivity and improved the mechanical properties of high-density polyethylene system (Jiang and Drzal 2011). Moreover, the fatigue damage of {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) composites was monitored using CNTs (Reda Taha et al. 2014).|$|R
5000|$|Over time, {{regardless}} of the sorbent used, sticks of dynamite will [...] "weep" [...] or [...] "sweat" [...] nitroglycerin, which can then pool {{in the bottom of}} the box or storage area. For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage. Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction, and temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the risk of an explosion without the use of a blasting cap is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> cardboard.|$|R
