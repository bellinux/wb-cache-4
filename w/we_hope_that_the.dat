25|$|We devoutly {{wish that}} a means {{had been found}} to avoid the May 4th events {{culminating}} in the Guard shootings and the irreversible deaths and injuries. We deeply regret those events and are profoundly saddened by the deaths of four students and the wounding of nine others which resulted. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agreement to end the litigation will help to assuage the tragic memories regarding that sad day.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be shown that if an extreme point is not a maximum point of the {{objective}} function then there is an edge containing the point so that the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge {{moving away from the}} point. If the edge is finite then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with greater and greater objective values. This continues until the maximum value is reached or an unbounded edge is visited, concluding that the problem has no solution. The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of vertices visited will be small.|$|E

We are sorry for the Sri Lankan team. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players ... I read two, three names ... Samaraweera, Mendis ... I hope they are safe and will recover. We are shocked by that incident." [...] Further he said that Pakistan could become a failed state and it was not clear who was in control of the country.|$|E
2500|$|... – President Dmitry Medvedev {{expressed}} condolences {{over the}} death of Kim Jong Il, the Kremlin press service reported on Monday. Medvedev also held a phone conversation with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak concerning Kim's death, according to the report. The two leaders discussed several issues of common concern, including regional integration and stability. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: [...] "The DPRK is our neighbor. We maintain a good-neighborly relationship. Of course, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loss of Kim Jong-Il will not have any impact on the development of our friendly relations with the DPRK".|$|E
2500|$|... – [...] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{stated that}} [...] "Poland fully respects the {{principles}} of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity of the Kingdom of Spain. We believe that solving the dispute between {{the government of the}} Kingdom of Spain and Catalonia, just like any disputes between the Kingdom of Spain and its autonomous regions, including separatist tendencies, are an internal affair of the Kingdom of Spain. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situation in Catalonia will stabilise quickly in observance of the constitution of the Kingdom of Spain".|$|E

I am eager to engage {{once again with}} Americans {{in the kinds of}} {{face-to-face}} discussions that are central to academic exchange and crucial to bridging cultural divides." [...] Melissa Goodman, staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project, issued a statement saying, [...] "Given today's decision, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Obama administration will immediately end Professor Ramadan's exclusion. We also encourage the new administration to reconsider the exclusion of other foreign scholars, writers and artists who were barred from the country by the Bush administration on ideological grounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier {{issued the}} statement: [...] "Canada condemns {{in the strongest}} terms this attack on the {{restoration}} of Pakistan’s efforts to return to full democracy. Today’s violence is especially heinous {{in view of the}} upcoming elections on January 8, 2008. The anti-democratic intent of the perpetrators could not be more obvious. I urge the Government and people of Pakistan to continue to reject all forms of violence and to resist those who seek to destabilize their country. Stability in Pakistan is vital for regional stability and security. We extend our deepest condolences to the family of Benazir Bhutto, {{to the families of the}} other victims of today’s attack, and to the Pakistani people. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time." [...] Prime Minister Stephen Harper later added to reporters at a press meeting in Calgary: [...] "We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. This was an abhorrent act of terror. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government of Pakistan will act to bring the perpetrators to justice".|$|E

60|$|The {{article on}} Edoardo Fusco also {{is full of}} interest, and is a timely tribute {{to the memory of}} one who did so much for the {{education}} and culture of modern Italy.

They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study.|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} Letters and {{the little}} Notes on Birds are inserted here by the express wish of Mr. Ruskin. I had it in my mind to pay Susie some extremely fine compliments about these Letters and Notes, and to compare her method of observation with Thoreau's, and above all, to tell some very pretty stories showing her St. Francis-like sympathy with, and gentle power over, all living creatures; but Susie says that she is already far too prominent, and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> readers of [...] "Hortus" [...] will see for themselves how she reverences and cherishes all noble life, with a special tenderness, I think, for furred and feathered creatures. To all outcast and hungry things the Thwaite is a veritable Bethlehem, or House of Bread, and to her, their sweet [...] "Madonna Nourrice," [...] no less than to her Teacher, the sparrows and linnets that crowd its thresholds {{are in a very}} particular sense [...] "Sons of God." ...|$|E
60|$|Katie's {{heart beat}} high {{as she got}} out of the {{carriage}}--Mrs. Val's private carriage had been kept on for the occasion--and saw before and above her on the stairs a crowd of muslin crushing its way on towards the room prepared for dancing. Katie had never been to a ball before. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word ball may not bring down on us the adverse criticism of the Morning Post. It was probably not a ball in the strictly fashionable sense of the word, but it was so to Katie to all intents and purposes. Her dancing had hitherto been done either at children's parties, or as a sort of supplemental amusement to the evening tea-gatherings at Hampton or Hampton Court. She had never yet seen the muse worshipped with the premeditated ceremony of banished carpets, chalked floors, and hired musicians. Her heart consequently beat high as she made her way upstairs, linked arm-in-arm with Ugolina Neverbend.|$|E

How they did it heaven only knows, for the Hau-Haus were all round. That is all we know at present, and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of the settlers of the outlying stations round Matawhero succeeded in getting into Taranganui. Whether the Hau-Haus will be satisfied with the slaughter they have effected, or will try to penetrate further into the settlement or attack Taranganui, remains to be seen. Of course the people who have escaped are, like ourselves, ignorant of everything that has taken place except what happened in their immediate neighbourhood. I should fancy, myself, that however widespread the massacre may have been, the Hau-Haus started last night on their way back. They would know that as soon as the news reached Wairoa the force there will be on the move to cut them off." ...|$|E

'Here {{must be the}} {{principal}} work, the training up missionaries and steadfast Christian men and women, not of ability sufficient to become themselves missionaries, but necessary to strengthen {{the hands of their}} more gifted countrymen. This training must be carried on here, but with it must be combined a frequent visitation and as lengthened sojourns in the islands as possible. The next winter <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rev. J. Atkin will be some time at San Cristoval, the Rev. C. H. Brooke at Florida, the Rev. J. Palmer at Mota. But I am more than ever convinced that the chiefest part of our work is to consist in training up Melanesian clergymen, and educating them up to the point of faithfully reproducing our simple teaching. We must hope to see native self-supporting Melanesian Churches, not weak indolent Melanesians dependent always on an English missionary, but steadfast, thoughtful men and women, retaining the characteristics of their race so far as they can be sanctified by the Word of God in prayer, and not force useless imitations of English modes of thought and nineteenth century civilisation.|$|E
60|$|In the {{official}} correspondence which is published between the Boer and British leaders in South Africa may very clearly be traced {{the way in}} which this practice came to assume proportions which shocked public opinion. It must be admitted that the results have not justified it, and that, putting all moral questions apart, a burned-out family is the last which is likely to settle down, as <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Boers may eventually settle down, as contented British citizens. On the other hand, when a nation adopts guerilla tactics it deliberately courts those sufferings to the whole country which such tactics invariably entail. They have been the same in all wars and at all times. The army which is stung by guerillas, strikes round it furiously and occasionally indiscriminately. An army which is continually sniped and harassed becomes embittered, and a General feels called upon to take those harsher measures which precedent and experience suggest. That such measures have not been pushed to an extreme by the British authorities is shown {{by the fact that the}} captured guerilla has been made a prisoner of war--unlike his prototype, the franc-tireur. The general question of guerillas may be discussed later. At present we will confine our attention to the burning of farms.|$|E
