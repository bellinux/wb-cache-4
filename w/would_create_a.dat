5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a landing {{on the edge of}} Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, <b>would</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E

Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E
