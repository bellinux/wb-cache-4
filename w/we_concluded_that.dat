Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be better to}} put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust".

2500|$|The unfinalized {{status of}} East Jerusalem has caused issues when {{attempting}} to market Jerusalem to international tourists. In 2009, 2010, and again in 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled against a series of Israeli Ministry of Tourism advertising campaigns that displayed images and information about tourist sites located in East Jerusalem. The advertising authority wrote in its ruling that [...] "the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank {{was the subject of}} much international dispute, and because we considered that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the ad was likely to mislead." [...] Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided [...] "basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|In our {{schematic}} example above, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face {{a critical}} question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M {{as a cause of}} any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves [...] overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the year}} 2003 in India, several {{telecommunications}} companies were competing for {{a share of}} the rapidly growing mobile phone market. Hutch wanted to convey the message that its service was robust enough to provide coverage in every part of its coverage areas. It hired Ogilvy & Mather, Mumbai to create an advertisement campaign focusing on this theme. Mahesh V. and Rajeev Rao, Senior Creative Directors at the agency, spent a whole night developing the idea. [...] "We did not want to talk about technology, and we consciously avoided showing people talking on the mobile", says Mahesh. Their first idea was a little sister following her brother. [...] "On second thoughts, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> a dog would be much less mushy", adds Mahesh. That's when they hit upon the theme, [...] "Wherever you go, our network follows", and the idea for the campaign: a dog that follows a boy in the most unlikely places – school, bath, barber shop, etc. [...] "Man's best friend was the simplest analogy that could represent unconditional support", says Renuka Jaypal, National Business Director of O ...|$|E
60|$|In {{examining}} {{the nature of}} Gothic, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the chief}} elements of power in that, and in all good architecture, was the acceptance of uncultivated and rude energy in the workman.
