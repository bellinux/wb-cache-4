5|$|A {{wide range}} of {{theological}} and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified monism (Vishishtadvaita). Madhvacharya, a Hindu philosopher <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna {{in the framework of}} dualism (Dvaita). Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure monism (advaita, called shuddhadvaita) framework by Vallabha Acharya, who was the founder of Pushti sect of vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philospher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, who is credited for unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.|$|E

5|$|Smetana had {{virtually}} no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E
5|$|The World Before the Flood is {{strongly}} influenced by A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan (1632–33) by Nicolas Poussin, whom Etty greatly admired and of <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> he had previously made several copies; this painting had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not visible in the painting. Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E

Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.|$|E
5|$|In Wallonia, {{literature}} in French began a revival in 1881 {{with the creation}} of the La Jeune Belgique ("The Young Belgium") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. Among the members of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, <b>whose</b> <b>works</b> were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style, and the poet Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.|$|E
