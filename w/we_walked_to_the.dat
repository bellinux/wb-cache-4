25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and â€“ how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} platform, side by side, in silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{break of}} the poop, where {{she turned and}} faced me. I glanced around to see {{that no one was}} within hearing distance.|$|E
6000|$|Thus <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, in {{friendly}} colloquy. Somehow if {{he failed}} to speak of shirtings and hosiery, I should feel as if a familiar cord had broken; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, [...] "let us {{have our}} coffee later. We have {{finished}} dinner {{and the moon}} is coming up. If <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom there, <b>we</b> shall see it from the bend of the river, and we shall escape from those men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ridge?" [...] Herminia {{asked with}} a sudden burst of suggestion. [...] "It's too rare a day to waste a minute of it indoors. I was waiting till you came. We can talk all the freer for the fresh air on the hill-top." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] said Leonard Dickinson {{to me as}} <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank together, [...] "Scherer {{will never}} be any good any more. Too much prosperity. And he's begun to have his nails manicured." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{far end of}} the hall. Major Fitz-David {{opened the}} door of a long, narrow room built out {{at the back of the}} house as a smoking-room, and {{extending}} along one side of the courtyard as far as the stable wall.|$|E
60|$|Mitchell did {{not appear}} amused. I watched his face anxiously. He had made no remark, but the missed putt which would have saved the hole had been very short, and I feared the worst. There was a {{brooding}} {{look in his eye}} as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth tee.|$|E
6000|$|There came a still longer interval, which Mrs. Pope {{ended with}} the {{slightest}} of shivers. She perceived Mr. Magnet was heavy for sympathy and ripe to confide. [...] "I think," [...] she said, [...] "it's a little cool here. Shall <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Water Garden, {{and see if there}} are any white lilies?" ...|$|R
60|$|This I {{did very}} reverently and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temple almost in silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great door of Styles, {{and at once}} <b>the</b> {{knowledge}} came <b>to</b> us {{that something}} was wrong.|$|R
60|$|I {{pressed her}} arm to mine, but I said nothing. When I could avoid it, I {{preferred}} not to discuss those other matters. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship's side, and leaned over to watch the phosphorus. Suddenly she whispered in my ear, her lips were so close to my cheek that I felt her warm breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} that view several times," [...] she answered; and then, after a little pause, she added, [...] "But I don't mind in the least seeing it again." [...] Together <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bluff. There we found two rude seats which had been made for the {{convenience}} of viewers, and on one of these she seated herself.|$|E
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} at once, and moved towards the door. I was left alone with my father, but he never stirred during her absence, nor did I speak to him. She {{returned}} in a few minutes, dressed very quietly, and wearing a veil which completely obscured her features. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corner of the square, and then I called a hansom.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} {{path through the}} plantation, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village through the woods which bordered {{one side of the}} estate.|$|R
60|$|So our bonds were undone and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> {{king and}} Brother John stood, the miserable Imbozwi and his {{attendant}} doctors {{huddled in a}} heap before them.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drug store. On entering, Mr. Harrison {{ordered a}} couple of glasses of soda water and then called the {{proprietor}} aside.|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} as I preceded him downstairs {{what had}} happened to the little lady in the tea-shop. Had they quarrelled already, or was his infatuation passed? It seemed hardly likely if, as appeared, he had been taking steps for a year to make his desperate plunge. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Avenue de Clichy, and sat down at one of the tables on the pavement of a large cafe.|$|E
60|$|Ere it was yet dawn Charmion came again, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private harbour of the palace. There, taking boat, we rowed to {{the island}} mount on which stands the Timonium, a vaulted tower, strong, small, and round. And, having landed, we twain {{came to the door}} and knocked, till at length a grating was thrown open in the door, and an aged eunuch, looking forth, roughly asked our business.|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} morning {{when we arrived}} at the wayside station where we were to alight. From here <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the woods. Arrived at this point we halted. I took off my clothes, with the {{exception}} of my union suit. Then, taking a pot of brown stain from my valise, I proceeded to dye my face and hands and my union suit itself a deep butternut brown.|$|E
60|$|Adrian smiled gently; {{and after}} giving his orders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gamekeepers, {{he came up}} to me; putting his arm in mine, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mansion.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he may be}} able to give us some information," [...] Louise asserted; [...] "so I propose <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town {{tomorrow}} morning and interview him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{not to be}} able to accept your invitation," [...] I said, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "Perhaps you will give me another chance?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skirts of the Sal forest. The great trunks {{of the trees}} were often scored by tigers' claws, this animal indulging in the cat-like {{propensity}} of rising and stretching itself against such objects. Two species of Dillenia were common in the forest, with long grass, Symplocos, Emblica, and Cassia Fistula, now covered with long pods. Several parasitical air-plants grew on the dry trees, as Oberonia, Vanda, and Aerides.|$|E
60|$|As {{no answer}} was {{forthcoming}} <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} swamp, and looked over it. It was apparently boundless, and vast flocks of every sort of waterfowl flew from its recesses, till it was sometimes difficult to see the sky. Now that the sun was getting high it drew thin sickly looking clouds of poisonous vapour {{from the surface of}} the marsh and from the scummy pools of stagnant water.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{all went}} to Stickle Tarn. A very fine, warm, sunny, {{beautiful}} [...] morning. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fair. ... It was a lovely moonlight night. [...] We talked much about our house on Helvellyn. The moonlight shone only [...] upon the village. It did not eclipse the village lights; and the sound [...] of dancing and merriment came along the still air. I walked with [...] Coleridge and William up the lane and by the church...." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{house of}} that lady, and at my suggestion Philippa sought her couch. I {{sat down and}} awaited the advent of Mrs. Thompson. She soon appeared.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing and, {{descending}} the stairs, {{reached the}} street {{and stepped into the}} motor car that was waiting for us. It rolled off and turned into Piccadilly.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing," [...] said I, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station. [...] "If the husband's {{name was}} James, {{and the other}} was Henry, what was this talk about David?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orchid-house, we {{went through}} it, and she {{explained}} all its beauties, its singularities, and its rarities. When we came out again, I asked myself: [...] "Is she {{in the habit of}} doing all this to chance visitors? Would she treat a Brown or a Robinson in the way she is treating me?" [...] I could not answer my question, but if Brown and Robinson had appeared at that moment I should have been glad to knock their heads together.|$|E
60|$|Tide bothered {{us again}} this morning. It seems {{exceedingly}} {{difficult to tell}} one night before what the tide {{is going to do}} the next morning. At ten o'clock <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same place we were yesterday. It was a bright, warm day, with just enough breeze to ruffle the water and make fishing pleasant, and we certainly expected to have good luck. But we fished for about three hours without any sign of a fish. This was discouraging and we could not account for it.|$|E
60|$|When {{the lady}} Blanche {{was out of}} sight, {{followed}} by the women who had sheltered {{with us in the}} cave, William and I went to a stream we knew of not far away and drank our fill. Then <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three whom I had shot with my big bow, hoping to regain the arrows, for I had none left. This, however, could not be done though all the men were dead, for one of the shafts, the last, was broken, and the other two were so fixed in flesh and bone that only a surgeon's saw would loose them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No one in {{the whole}} wide world, dear," [...] said she, and put her arms round his bull neck. <b>We</b> three <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and stood amazed at the sight which met our eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked him}} heartily for the offer, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose {{they were all}} in the saddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall {{we see you}} {{tomorrow}} to dinner?" [...] said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was leaving them. [...] "I do not ask you <b>to</b> come in <b>the</b> morning, for <b>we</b> must <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park, <b>to</b> call on Lady Middleton." ...|$|R
