However, the tourism industry {{has not always been}} involved in these developments, nor appreciative of tourism degrees. Tourism employers have suggested that tourism graduates do not meet their needs, and voiced concern about the relevance of tourism degrees. Yet, {{there has not been a}} comprehensive study which explores employers' perceptions of the value of tourism degrees. This thesis aims to address this by providing an in-depth exploration of how tourism employers perceive the value of tourism degrees. To achieve this aim, a mixed method approach was adopted. A qualitative approach to this study was employed in its first stage. The findings from this stage were used to inform the second quantitative stage. The results indicate that the perceived value of tourism degrees is based on both its employment relevance and academic status. From an employment perspective, the majority of jobs available to graduates are entry level jobs which do not require holding a degree. These jobs are often customer facing, with what employers term as 'personality' being considered a key requirement. Tourism degrees are not seen to contribute to graduates meeting this requirement. Rather, they are seen to contribute to gaining knowledge of the industry, which incidentally is low on the employers' list of requirements. The importance of relevant work experience where skills such as customer-service skills can be developed and demonstrated should thus not be overlooked. <b>Work</b> <b>experience</b> <b>schemes</b> based on cooperation between universities and the industry could also have a positive effect on graduates' employability not only by expanding their work experience, but also because such cooperation is often linked to a more positive view ofthe value of tourism degrees.

40|$|Introduction The Federal Polytechnic Nekede was {{established}} in 1978 by Edict No 16 of the than Imo State Government enacted by the Col. Sunday Adenihu government. The Imo State Government amended the Edict establishing the instruction in 1987 and renamed it, the Polytechnic Nekede. However, the ownership {{and management of the}} institution was taken over from the Imo State Government on the 7 th April, 1993 by the Federal Government of Nigeria after which it became Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri. The Department of Library and Information Science, Federal Polytechnic Nekede, {{was established}} in 1979. The first set of students was admitted in the year 1980 / 1981 academic session. In the academic session of 1985 / 1986, the maiden National Diploma and Higher National Diploma (HND) Programmes in Library Science were accredited. As of date, the Library and Information Science department of Federal Polytechnic Nekede runs both HND and ND Programmes in regular, evening and week-end Programmes of the School. Industrial training for Library and Information Science student is of paramount importance. The students are expected to acquire adequate and relevant skills that would enable them to perform effectively in their future place of work or assignment. In spite of the high level of quality and qualified Library Science educators in Nigeria library schools, there are still gaps in both the theoretical and practical knowledge acquired by the students. As noted by Ugwu (2010), there is a serious need to give effective education and training to Library and Information professionals for improved service delivery to the society. The quality of service rendered in the library is in proportion to the level of knowledge and skills possessed by the library staff and {{it is a fact that}} today library science students are the librarians of tomorrow, and if effective service delivery should be expected from them, it is imperative that they are given adequate opportunities to acquire an all round skills.

Hence, active participation in SIWES is a pre-requisite for the award of diploma and the various degree certificates in almost all {{institutions of higher learning}} in Nigeria. However, the monitoring methods (which are majorly manual), that are adopted hitherto to ensure adherence by students to the rules and regulations of the scheme have been grossly inefficient.

Descriptive research design was adopted for the study and total enumeration sampling technique was used to select 277 respondents covering three institutions; Adeleke University, Ede Osun state, University of Ibadan, Ibadan and Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijebu Ode, Ogun state. The respondents are students who have gone through student industrial <b>experience</b> <b>scheme.</b> Questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. Data collected was analysed using descriptive statistics and simple percentages. Findings revealed that majority of LIS students understudied had their trainings in the libraries. The facilities available at the places of training included: computer laboratories, internet services, e-libraries and audio-visuals. Computer laboratory and internet facilities had the greatest frequencies 207 (93. 7 %) each These accounted for the students’ perceptions that SIWES influences professional development positively with response rate of 216 (97. 7 %) agreement, and that SIWES exposed them to new work methods also with response rate of 216 (97. 7 %) agreement.

The data collected were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis using SPSS.

Out of 110 students that had access to computer system, about 87. 4 % had related engineering application software on their personal computer while only 76. 2 % could use them proficiently.

Out of 617 students from 36 schools that visited NIFFR, 282 (46 %) were for IT from 16 tertiary institutions in the six geo-political zones. Over 80 % of the IT students were University students {{in the department of}} fisheries dominated by institutions in the South West and North Central zones. SIWES students spend 2 - 32 weeks to acquire skills and practical knowledge in different aspects of fisheries like artisanal, aquaculture & biotechnology, fish technology, environmental studies, and socio-economic / extension. High influx of students in the department of fisheries is an indication that NIFFR adds value to graduates of fisheries. However, it is appalling to note that students of agricultural extension never utilize opportunities existing at NIFFR for industrial training like their counterparts in fisheries department. This is a pointer to a large extent that the challenge of training skilled and competent professionals for fishery agricultural extension is still a mirage rather than a reality. To reverse the ugly trend, students of agricultural extension in various tertiary institutions should be compelled to spend at least two weeks of their IT period at NIFFR for practical experience.

In today's world, TVET has undergone several transformations in fulfilling its tasks to produce excellent, competitive and skilful human capital. The paper identifies strategies to be used in enhancing skills-acquisition of undergraduate TVET students through improved collaboration with industries in Nigeria. It reviewed two prominent forms of technical cooperation that exist between HEIs and industries in Nigeria, vis-a-vis endowment of chairs and other research positions to promote excellence and provision of Students’ Industrial <b>Work</b> <b>Experience</b> <b>Scheme</b> (SIWES) positions to undergraduate students. This practice is continuously yielding positive results within the mandate of Industrial Training Fund (ITF). The current trend in TVET places much emphasis on entrepreneurship education to promote creativity and poverty alleviation strategies that will generate job-creation avenues to Nigeria's teeming graduates. The paper discussed entrepreneurial education as an instrument per excellent to unlock economic potentials of Nigerian citizens through innovative collaboration with the industry. It advocated for a review of SIWES program to develop entrepreneurial skills that contributes to an individual's personal development, increase his productivity and income and facilitate participation in economic and social life. It was recommended that all hands should be on deck to help our youths mitigate poverty by providing them with skills; entrepreneurial attitude and knowledge to raise their output and generate income. This calls for continued lifelong learning and training to enable continuous relevance to the world of work.
