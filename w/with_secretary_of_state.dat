5|$|Several forts in Confederate {{territory}} {{remained in}} Union hands. Davis sent {{a commission to}} Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, {{as well as the}} Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell. From Alabama, he later resigned from the federal government. Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.|$|E
5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, Grant {{sought to}} {{increase}} trade and influence while remaining at peace with the world. <b>With</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated a peaceful resolution with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift among Republicans. His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and bankruptcies. When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office as president, Johnson reached an accord <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> William H. Seward {{that there would be}} no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would {{continue}} to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber-rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.|$|E

25|$|The coup {{had been}} staged {{in the absence}} of American {{ambassador}} Leonard Unger, who was in Saigon conferring <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Dean Rusk, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, and Assistant Secretary for State for Far Eastern Affairs William P. Bundy. American ambassador Leonard Unger hastily returned from his conference on 23 April, accompanied by Bundy. Unger confronted Siho and Kouprasith and informed them that the United States supported Souvanna Phouma and the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos of 23 July 1962. Unger noted that the two mutinous officers reacted like frightened schoolboys. Bundy thought they were desperate to save face. Unger ordered Siho and Kouprasith to release their captives while announcing they had taken Souvanna Phouma into custody to secure the national government. In a face saving gesture, they did so. Unger's orders had ended the abortive coup.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{interview}} <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Lord Sydney in March 1784, Matra amended {{his proposal to}} include convicts as settlers. Matra’s plan {{can be seen to}} have “provided the original blueprint for settlement in New South Wales”. A cabinet memorandum December 1784 shows the Government had Matra’s plan in mind when considering the creation of a settlement in New South Wales. The London Chronicle of 12 October 1786 said: “Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing with Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is the Gentleman who suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island”. The Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for settling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Banks’s Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger's {{insistence on}} higher defense budgets, his {{disagreements}} {{within the administration}} and with Congress on this issue, and his differences <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal from office by President Ford in November 1975. Schlesinger's legacy included {{the development of the}} close-air support aircraft the A-10, and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would not put the United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary's harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed President Ford, who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other important personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as secretary of state. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.|$|E

25|$|British Government {{was assured}} of Singapore's {{internal}} security due to Lim's tough stance against the communists. This allowed re-negotiations for self-rule from December 1956 to June 1958. Under Lim's leadership, {{a delegation of}} representatives from various political parties headed to London in March 1957 to commence talks with the British for self-rule. They reached a consensus in April, while Lim signed a new constitutional agreement <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for the Colonies Alan Lennox-Boyd on behalf of Singapore. Representatives from Singapore drafted a new constitution; In August 1958, the British Parliament passed the State of Singapore Act. Based on the agreement, {{there would be a}} great {{increase in the number of}} Legislative Assembly seats to be contested in the 1959 election, where all seats would be popularly elected; Singapore would become a self-governing state, with the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers being replaced respectively by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Singapore, in charge of all affairs except defence and diplomacy; The Yang di-Pertuan Negara would replace the existing Governor.|$|E
25|$|In 1806 he {{negotiated}} the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95 {{because he felt}} it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees {{that would have been}} good for business, Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> James Madison.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger had {{an abiding}} {{interest}} in strategic theory, {{but he also}} had to deal with a succession of immediate crises that tested his administrative and political skills. In October 1973, three months after he took office, Arab countries launched a surprise attack on Israel and started the Yom Kippur War. A few days after the war started, with Israel not faring as well as expected militarily, the Soviets resupplying some Arab countries and the Israeli government having authorized the use and assembly of nuclear weapons, the United States began an overt operation to airlift materiel to Israel. As Schlesinger explained, the initial U.S. policy to avoid direct involvement rested on the assumption that Israel would win quickly. But {{when it became clear that}} the Israelis faced more formidable military forces than anticipated, and could not meet their own resupply arrangements, the United States took up the burden. Schlesinger rejected charges that the Defense Department delayed the resupply effort to avoid irritating the Arab states and that he had had a serious disagreement over this matter <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Henry Kissinger. Eventually the combatants agreed to a cease-fire, but not before the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Arab side and the United States declared a higher level worldwide alert of its forces.|$|E

25|$|On taking office, Clay and the War Hawks {{demanded that}} the British revoke the Orders in Council, a series of decrees that {{resulted}} in a commercial war with the United States. Clay also strongly supported the expedition of William Henry Harrison against the forces of the Native American leader Tecumseh, and Clay celebrated Harrison's victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. With a possible war looming, Clay helped pass President Madison's request to raise armies and navies, though the naval expansion was not as large as Clay had called for. When Madison called for war, Clay led the House to a quick passage of a declaration of war against Britain. Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, and the War of 1812 began. During the war, Clay frequently communicated <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> James Monroe and Secretary of War William Eustis, though he advocated for the replacement of the latter. Frustrated at Eustis's perceived inaction, Clay urged William Henry Harrison to reinforce the American force at the Siege of Detroit. The war started poorly for the Americans and for Clay, who lost friends and relatives in the fighting. However, in October 1813, the British asked Madison begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team. Madison hoped that the presence of the leading War Hawk would ensure that Americans looked favorably on a peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress, but chose to felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814, and prepared to travel to Europe.|$|E

When Bigelow resigned in mid-1866, Hay, as was customary, submitted his resignation, though he was asked to remain until Bigelow's successor was in place, and stayed until January 1867. He consulted <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> William H. Seward, asking him for [...] "anything worth having". Seward suggested the post of Minister to Sweden, but reckoned without the new president, Andrew Johnson, who had his own candidate.

The world's media descended on Belfast, and several intermediaries visited Sands in an attempt to negotiate an end to the hunger strike, including Síle de Valera, granddaughter of Éamon de Valera, Pope John Paul II's personal envoy John Magee, and European Commission of Human Rights officials. With Sands close to death, the government's position remained unchanged, <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Northern Ireland Humphrey Atkins stating [...] "If Mr. Sands persisted in his wish to commit suicide, that was his choice.

Soon after Lincoln's second inauguration in March 1865, the two secretaries were appointed to the US delegation in Paris, Nicolay as consul and Hay as secretary of legation. [...] Hay wrote to his brother Charles that the appointment was [...] "entirely unsolicited and unexpected", a statement that Kushner and Sherrill found unconvincing given that Hay had spent hundreds of hours during the war <b>with</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> William H.
