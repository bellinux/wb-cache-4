50|$|After {{the primary}} {{fermentation}} of red grapes the free run <b>wine</b> is <b>pumped</b> off into tanks and the skins are pressed {{to extract the}} remaining juice and wine. The press wine is blended with the free run wine at the winemaker's discretion. The wine is kept warm and the remaining sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|R
2500|$|The initial {{distilled}} spirit {{produced by}} a pot still, known as low wine has an alcohol content of about 20 to 40%. The low <b>wines</b> are then <b>pumped</b> into a second still, known as the spirit still, and distilled a second (and sometimes a third) time. The final spirit, called [...] "new make spirit", generally has an alcohol content of 60 to 70%.|$|R

40|$|Currently partial alcohol {{reduction}} of wine {{is in the}} focus of research worldwide. There are several technologies available to achieve this target. These techniques are either based on distilling or membrane processes. Osmotic distillation, one of the possibilities, is a quite modern membrane process that can be used. During that process, <b>wine</b> is <b>pumped</b> in counter flow to water along a micro porous, hydrophobic membrane. The volatile components of the wine can permeate that membrane and are dissolved in water. The driving force of that process is the vapor pressure difference between the volatiles on the wine and water side of the membrane. The aim of this work {{was to determine if}} the alcohol reduction by osmotic distillation can change the isotopic relation in a wine. Can this enological practice change the composition of a wine in a way that an illegal water addition is simulated? Different wines were reduced by 2 % alcohol v/v with varying process parameters. The isotopic analysis of the O 16 / 18 ratio in the wine were performed according to the OIV methods (353 / 2009) These analyses showed that the isotopic ratio is modified by an alcohol {{reduction of}} 2 % v/v in a way that corresponds to an addition of 4 – 5 % of external water...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the {{fermentation}} process, {{carbon dioxide}} is released as a byproduct of the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The carbon dioxide seeks {{to escape from the}} must by rising {{to the top of the}} mixture, pushing the grape skins and other materials to the top as well. This forms what is known as a cap that is visible on top of the fermentation vessel. At this point, a very limited amount of the must comes into contact with the skins, and winemakers seek to correct this by pushing down the cap (either with equipment or the traditional method of treading with their feet) or by <b>pumping</b> <b>wine</b> out from under and over onto the cap. This process of [...] "pumping over" [...] or [...] "punching down" [...] the cap is done often throughout the fermentation process, depending on the extent of maceration the winemaker desires. [...] An efficient and modern method of maceration is the [...] "pneumatage process" [...] in which compressed air or gas is sequentially injected into the juice. The bubbles created during the pneumatage process uses gravity and the weight of the juice to circulate the wine juice with the cap of skins and grape solids allowing for greater extraction of aroma, coloring agents and tannins to diffuse into the wine juice ("must").|$|R

Nadzorna enota je na eni strani sestavljena iz elektro omarice in dveh stikal –pretočnega stikala za merjejnje količine tekočine in nivojskega stikala za nadziranje vklopa in izklopa črpalke. Oboje komunicira preko kabla s platformo Arduino. Na drugi strani preko {{bluetooth}} HC- 06 modula pošiljamo odčitane podatke s senzorjev na aplikacijo na telefonu, kjer lahko spremljamo količino tekočine v cisternah. Nadzorna enota je splošen {{model in}} ne velja samo za črpalko, ki smo jo uporabili pri projektu. Važno je le, da je črpalka enofazna. The graduation thesis describes {{a control unit}} that will save time for <b>wine</b> producers when <b>pumping</b> must (a <b>wine</b> making term which means unfermented grapes, in nonprofessional’s terms), or wine. On the one hand, the control unit is composed of an electrical box and two switches. First, a liquid flow switch for measuring the liquid level and the second, a level switch for controlling the turning on and off of the pump. Both switches communicate via cable with the Arduino platform. On the other hand, bluetooth HC- 06 module sends data readings from switches into the app on the phone, where the amount of liquid in the tank is monitored. The control unit is a generic model and does not apply only to the pump, which {{was used in the}} project. It is also, of utmost importance that the pump is single-phased...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{trends in}} the {{worldwide}} market favored fruitier, less tannic wines that could be consumed at a younger age. A group of Barolo producers, led by the house of Ceretto, Paolo Cordero di Montezemolo, Elio Altare, and Renato Ratti, started making more modern, international styles of Barolos by using shorter periods for maceration (days as opposed to weeks) and fermentation (usually 4872 hours or at most 810 days), less time aging in new small oak barrels and {{an extended period of}} bottle aging prior to release. By using modern technology, including specialized tanks that allow the <b>wine</b> to be <b>pumped</b> out from underneath the cap of skins and then pumped over, they found ways to maximize color extraction and minimize harsh tannins. Prior to this [...] "modernist" [...] movement, Nebbiolo was often harvested slightly unripe and at high yields which left the grapes with harsh green tannins that had not had time to fully polymerize. To maximize color extraction, producers would subject the wine to extended periods of maceration, taking up to several weeks, and then several years aging in large oak casks to soften the wine. Through the long slow process of oxidation, the perception of tannins would lessen (such as occurs when decanting wine), but the fruit would also fade and become oxidized. The decline in fruit would {{no longer be able to}} balance the remaining harsh tannins, leaving a bitter, astringent wine with withered fruit. To counter this change, some producers would blend in other grape varieties such as Arneis and Barbera to add color, fruit or softness to the wine.|$|R
