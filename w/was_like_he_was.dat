500|$|A tour of a {{few months}} in Charlie Spivak's band in 1953 preceded Marmarosa being drafted into the army the {{following}} year. This exacerbated his problems: several months in a Veteran Administration hospital preceded his discharge, at which point he was in a poor psychological condition. Back in Pittsburgh, where he played locally from March 1956, Marmarosa continued to be erratic, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time, and giving his money away: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on the road to self-destruction", commented trumpeter Danny Conn. Amateur recordings from the pianist's concerts in Pittsburgh in 1958 were released four decades later by Uptown Records.|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me." [...] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: [...] "My first cartoon, I had {{to be carried out}} crying It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance.

500|$|In June 1946, Alf visited Mimi's {{house at}} 251 Menlove Avenue {{and took his}} son to Blackpool for a long 'holiday'—but {{secretly}} intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool, and after a heated argument Alf made the five-year-old boy choose between Julia or him. John chose Alf (twice) and then Julia walked away, {{but in the end}} John, crying, followed her, although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and John met again. In 1968, John Lennon told Hunter Davies that he soon forgot his father, saying, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|From mid-1996 Skunkhour {{created a}} new sound, abandoning spoken-word content and {{focusing}} more on melody. Aya described the re-defining moment when Dean provided the bass guitar for [...] "Foam": [...] "It really turned things around. That bassline is just out of control, and I was like, 'God, I {{want to get on}} this'. When Deano pulled out that bassline it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leading us into battle." [...] By that time Chris Simms had been added to live gigs as a percussionist. Their third album, Chin Chin, which was co-produced by the group with Magoo (Regurgitator), was preceded by its lead single, [...] "Breathing Through My Eyes" [...] in April. Chin Chin was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim and peaked at No.34. The Sun-Heralds Peter Holmes described it as [...] "a massive leap forward" [...] from the [...] "cliched, choppy funk material" [...] of their first two albums, concluding: [...] "Skunkhour's overall feel is heavier, the grooves are deeper and the arrangements a little rockier".|$|E

6000|$|An answer {{calculated}} so jistly betwixt the submission {{due to his}} parent, and {{the natural}} feeling of dignity in one who was by birth master of the mansion, excited universal satisfaction. And as Elspeth herself confessed to Tibb on the same evening, [...] "She {{did not think it}} had been in the callant. Till that night, he took pets and passions if he was spoke to, and lap through the house like a four-year-auld at the least word of advice that was minted at him, but now he spoke as grave and as douce as the Lord Abbot himself.

6000|$|It is now {{forty years}} since I first saw and heard Abraham Lincoln, but the {{impression}} which he left {{on my mind}} is ineffaceable. After his great successes in the West he came to New York to make a political address. He appeared {{in every sense of}} the word like one of the plain people among whom he loved to be counted. At first sight there was nothing impressive or imposing about him--except that his great stature singled him out from the crowd: his clothes hung awkwardly on his giant frame; his face was of a dark pallor, without the slightest tinge of color; his seamed and rugged features bore the furrows of hardship and struggle; his deep-set eyes looked sad and anxious; his countenance in repose gave little evidence of that brain power which had raised him from the lowest to the highest station among his countrymen; as he talked to me before the meeting, he seemed ill at ease, with that sort of apprehension which a young man might feel before presenting himself to a new and strange audience, whose critical disposition he dreaded. It was a great audience, including all the noted men--all the learned and cultured of his party in New York editors, clergymen, statesmen, lawyers, merchants, critics. They were all very curious to hear him. His fame as a powerful speaker had preceded him, and exaggerated rumor of his wit--the worst forerunner of an orator--had reached the East. When Mr. Bryant presented him, on the high platform of the Cooper Institute, a vast sea of eager upturned faces greeted him, full of intense curiosity to see what this rude child of the people <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> equal to the occasion. When he spoke he was transformed; his eye kindled, his voice rang, his face shone and seemed to light up the whole assembly. For an hour and a half he held his audience in the hollow of his hand. His style of speech and manner of delivery were severely simple. What Lowell called [...] "the grand simplicities of the Bible," [...] with which he was so familiar, were reflected in his discourse. With no attempt at ornament or rhetoric, without parade or pretence, he spoke straight to the point. If any came expecting the turgid eloquence or the ribaldry of the frontier, they must have been startled at the earnest and sincere purity of his utterances. It was marvellous to see how this untutored man, by mere self-discipline and the chastening of his own spirit, had outgrown all meretricious arts, and found his own way to the grandeur and strength of absolute simplicity.|$|E

But I never expected he'd <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> I thought he'd just <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the other men Leslie had boarded--conceited young asses, every one of them, that she never had any use for.

60|$|As Lieutenant Richard Brandon stood {{where the}} curve was boldest {{at the middle}} of the bridge, he had no misgivings about the result so far as the section for which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} <b>was</b> concerned. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> young, but there was some ground for his confidence; for he not only had studied all that text-books could teach him but he had the constructor's eye, which sees half-instinctively where strength or weakness lies.

5000|$|Howling Bells {{sought a}} {{producer}} that had experience working on electronic-sounding records.

Dan challenged us a lot as well, which we’ve never had before. He {{had a lot of}} inspiring ideas.

5000|$|Nomi {{came to the}} {{attention}} of New York City's art scene in 1978 with his performance in [...] "New Wave Vaudeville", a four-night event MC'd by artist David McDermott. Dressed in a skin-tight spacesuit with clear plastic cape, Nomi sang the aria Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix ("My heart opens to your voice") from Camille Saint-Saëns' 1877 opera Samson et Dalila. The performance ended with a chaotic crash of strobe lights, smoke bombs, and loud electronic sound effects as Nomi backed away into the smoke. Joey Arias recalled: [...] "I still get goose pimples when I think about it... It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> from a different planet and his parents were calling him home. When the smoke cleared, he was gone." [...] The reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that he was invited to perform at clubs all over New York City.|$|E
