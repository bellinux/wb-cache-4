5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data {{did not support the}} idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, {{did not seem to be}} important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 UCLA Law Review-All Rights Reserved. Of the large, public {{companies}} {{that seek to}} remain in business through bankruptcy reorganization, only 70 percent succeed. The assets of the other 30 percent are absorbed into other businesses. Success is important both because it is efficient and because it preserves jobs, communities, supplier and customer relationships, and tax revenues. This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Seventh, companies that prepackage or prenegotiate their plans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eighth, companies that file in periods of low interest rates <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Ninth, larger companies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Tenth, manufacturers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eleventh, companies with positive pre-filing operating income <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. System participants may be able to improve survival rates by shifting cases to more experienced judges and perhaps also by paying greater attention to the decisions to appoint creditors' committees, to prenegotiate plans, to obtain DIP loans, and to publicly seek alliances...|$|R
