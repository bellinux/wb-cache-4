25|$|Dietary fiber {{interacts with}} {{pancreatic}} and enteric enzymes and their substrates. Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect amylase activity {{and hence the}} rate of hydrolysis of starch.

25|$|Dietary fibers {{have three}} primary mechanisms: bulking, {{viscosity}} and fermentation. Different fibers have different effects, {{suggesting that a}} variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> provide excellent bulking effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, psyllium provides bulking as well as viscosity.|$|E

50|$|Whole-grain {{whole wheat}} flour is a full-flavored flour {{containing}} vitamins, minerals and protein. Whole-grain {{whole wheat flour}} is more nutritious than refined white flour, although white flour may, in a process called food fortification, have some micronutrients lost in processing added {{back to the white}} flour (required by law in some jurisdictions). Fortified white flour does not, however, contain the macronutrients of the <b>wheat's</b> <b>bran</b> and germ (especially fiber and protein) like whole-grain flour does, and is notably lacking in fiber. Whole grain is a good source of calcium, iron, fiber, and other minerals like selenium.|$|R

25|$|A graham cracker is cookie or {{digestive}} biscuit {{made with}} graham flour, {{a combination of}} fine-ground white flour and coarse-ground <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> and germ. Graham crackers are often used for making s'mores and pie crusts. Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Sylvester Graham in 1829, for his vegetarian diet. The Graham bread was high in fiber, made with non-sifted whole wheat flour and cut into little squares now known as graham crackers.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{historical}} {{consumer preference}} for refined white flour, {{whole wheat flour}} products are ascendant largely due to changing consumer attitudes. The Whole Grains Council industry association reports an approximate doubling of the whole wheat flour production from 2003 to 2007. In another visible example, whole wheat bread has reached approximate parity with white bread as measured by slice volume in the United States; as of 2010, whole wheat bread narrowly surpasses white bread as measured by dollar volume.Fortification of white flour whole grains are more nutritious than refined products and wheat is no exception. Whole wheat flour is more nutritious than refined white flour, although through food fortification, some micronutrients are added {{back to the white}} flour (required by law in some jurisdictions). Fortified white wheat flour does not, however, contain all of the macronutrients, fiber, antioxidants, phytonutrients, and much of the protein of the <b>wheat's</b> <b>bran</b> and germ. Whole wheat is a good source of calcium, iron, fiber, and other minerals like selenium.|$|R
30|$|Ferulic acid (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxycinnamic acid, FA) is {{abundant}} {{in nature and}} is derived from lignocellulosic biomass. FA is esterified to an arabinosyl residue of arabinoxylan in the plant cell wall and is linked to lignin (Walton et al. 2000). FA is a 3 -o-methyl phenolic moiety of lignin that crosslinks hemicellulose and lignin in the plant cell wall (Gopalan et al. 2015). FA is present in abundance in crops and in agricultural wastes such as rice bran, maize <b>bran,</b> corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>brans,</b> or straw (Gopalan et al. 2015). FA can be released from arabinosyl residues of arabinoxylan in the plant cell wall using alkaline solvents or enzymes (Gopalan et al. 2015). Maize bran contains approximately 30  g FA/kg dry weight of cell wall materials (Benoit et al. 2006). Corn and rice bran each contain approximately 32 and 33  g FA/kg dry weight of cell wall material, respectively (Mathew and Abraham 2004; Schmidt et al. 2013). FA is an inexpensive aromatic derived from plant biomass, {{which serves as a}} substrate for bioconversion to high-value aromatics.|$|R
25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E
500|$|Wheat is {{generally}} not used as a concentrate. [...] However, <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition, usually moistened and {{in the form of}} a bran mash. [...] <b>Wheat</b> <b>bran</b> is high in phosphorus, so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio of a ration. [...] Once touted for a laxative effect, this use of bran is now considered unnecessary, as horses, unlike humans, obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources.|$|E
500|$|It {{was once}} a common {{practice}} to give horses a weekly bran mash of <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> mixed with warm water and other ingredients. [...] It is still done regularly in some places. [...] While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary. [...] An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra hydration, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much <b>wheat</b> <b>bran</b> may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.|$|E

5000|$|Wheat milling {{methods to}} produce white flour {{eliminate}} those {{portions of the}} <b>wheat</b> kernel (<b>bran,</b> germ, shorts, and red dog mill streams) that are richest in proteins, vitamins, lipids and minerals.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of breadmaking cereal spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) {{is said to}} be higher than that of common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare), but this traditional view is not substantiated by scientific evidence. In an attempt to clarify this issue, wholemeal and milling fractions (sieved flour, fine bran, and coarse bran) from nine dehulled spelt and five soft winter wheat samples were compared with regard to their lipid, fatty acid, and mineral contents. In addition, tocopherol (a biochemical marker of germ) was measured in all wholemeals, whereas phytic acid and phosphorus levels were determined in fine bran and coarse bran samples after 1 month of storage. Results showed that, on average, spelt wholemeals and milling fractions were higher in lipids and unsaturated fatty acids as compared to wheat, whereas tocopherol content was lower in spelt, suggesting that the higher lipid content of spelt may not be related to a higher germ proportion. Although milling fractionation produced similar proportions of flour and brans in spelt and wheat, it was found that ash, copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus contents were higher in spelt samples, especially in aleurone-rich fine bran and in coarse bran. Even though phosphorus content was higher in spelt than in <b>wheat</b> <b>brans,</b> phytic acid content showed the opposite trend and was 40 % lower in spelt versus <b>wheat</b> fine <b>bran,</b> which may suggest that spelt has either a higher endogenous phytase activity or a lower phytic acid content than wheat. The results of this study give important indications on the real {{nutritional value}} of spelt compared to wheat. Moreover, they show that the Ca/Fe ratio, combined with that of oleate/palmitate, provides a highly discriminating tool to authenticate spelt from wheat flours and to face the growing issue of spelt flour adulteration. Finally, they suggest that aleurone differences, the nature of which still needs to be investigated, may account for the differential nutrient composition of spelt and wheat...|$|R
