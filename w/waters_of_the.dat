5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

50|$|Melt ponds can melt {{through to}} the ocean's surface. Seawater {{entering}} the pond increases the melt rate because <b>the</b> salty <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean is warmer than <b>the</b> fresh <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pond. The increase in salinity also depresses the water's freezing point.|$|R
5|$|In {{sea trials}} of the replica Philadelphia II, the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum {{determined}} that the boat was not particularly maneuverable: contemporary accounts of sailing the vessels include reports that the gondolas skipped across the <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, blown by the wind, and needed safe shelter when winds were high.|$|E
5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E

The rising <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Nile (a result {{of the construction of}} the Aswan High Dam) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex. The entire site was dismantled and reassembled 200 m further from the river, and 65 m higher, at a cost of around US$36 million.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E

60|$|The facts {{appear to}} be that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean is very {{slightly}} denser than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic (1.0278 to 1.0265), and that <b>the</b> deep <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean is slightly denser than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface; while <b>the</b> deep <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic is, if anything, lighter than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface. Moreover, while a rapid superficial current is setting in (always, save in exceptionally violent easterly winds) through <b>the</b> Straits <b>of</b> Gibraltar, from <b>the</b> Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a deep undercurrent (together with variable side currents) is setting out through the Straits, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.|$|R
5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 {{miles per hour}} (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well {{to the north of}} Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E

5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to use its small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and seagrass beds, as well as nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into the <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Isles.|$|E

5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As {{an indication of the}} intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E

A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later {{played a role in}} triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E
