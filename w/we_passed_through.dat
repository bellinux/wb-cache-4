One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E

The {{distance}} of this day's travel was [...] in which <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> Eastchester, New Rochelle, Mamaroneck, but as these places (although they have houses of worship in them) are not regularly laid out, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the immediate farms which are very close together and are separated as one inclosure from another is, by fences of stones which are indeed easily made as the country is immensely stony". The British Army briefly occupied sections of New Rochelle and Larchmont in 1776. Following British victory in the Battle of White Plains, New Rochelle became part of a [...] "neutral ground" [...] for General Washington to regroup his troops.|$|E

[...] Anne Maudslay told her adventure in the book A glimpse at Guatemala, from the Victorian Era perspective: [...] "After riding {{a mile or two}} along a road bordered by cottages bosomed in fruit trees we rose to a bleak tableland. [...] It was {{one of the very few}} days of unpleasant weather which we experience during the whole of our journey; a fierce wind raised clouds of dust and rustled through the ugly dry rastrojos, or stubbles of Indian corn, which covered the plain. <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the little Indian town of Zaragoza, chiefly noted for the manufacture of aparejos, the native pack-saddles. [...] I have been told that the Indians here have such a liking for dried alligator meat as a Lenten fare that the vendors of the highly-perfumed delicacy have to be locked up in the carcel (English: Jail for protection and sell the meat through the prison bars. [...] The streets were full of gaily-dressed people assembled for a fiesta, and dancing was going on in a shed, to a monotonous sound of a marimba.
