500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college. She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew. I {{had to find a}} <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do something like that, something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E
500|$|Both Toriyama and Kitase {{have responded}} to the mixed review scores the game received. Speaking to Siliconera about the Japanese reviews, Toriyama said that most of the negativity stemmed from the time limit, and that [...] "opinions on the game become more {{positive}} after some time since Lightning Returns initial release [...]" [...] Speaking with Joystiq, Kitase said that he [...] "wasn't really shocked. There are negative reviews and positive reviews, it's a real mixture. When I started making this game I took on very new challenges, so in a <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> anticipated that there would be mixed opinions, so this is more or less what we had anticipated." [...] Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met sales expectations and that Square Enix is satisfied with it.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Cobain {{was writing}} {{a number of new}} songs. At the time Cobain was {{listening}} to bands like The Melvins, R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene upon which Sub Pop had built its image, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single [...] "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said [...] "was like a statement in a <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that." [...] Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children's music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.|$|E

500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't {{want to come in}} and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E

I was going into a coma. My wife called 911 and while they were on the <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a heart attack. A day or so later I had to undergo a triple bypass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E

2500|$|Novello {{continued}} to write songs while {{serving in the}} RNAS. He had his first stage success with Theodore & Co in 1916, a production by George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard with a score composed by Novello and the young Jerome Kern. In the same year, Novello contributed to André Charlot's revue See-Saw. In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operette Arlette, for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh {{introduced him to the}} actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello's life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young Noël Coward. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour. He wrote, [...] "I just felt suddenly conscious of the long <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance".|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
