5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain <b>washings</b> of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

So did Carl Braun— Semmelweis's nemesis and {{successor}} as Johann Klein's assistant in Vienna— and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled {{the wishes of the}} Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian.

25|$|Semmelweis' {{advice on}} {{chlorine}} <b>washings</b> was probably more influential than he realized. Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared {{quite willing to}} experiment with the practical hand washing measures that he proposed, but virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking theoretical innovation— that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. Professor Gustav Adolf Michaelis from a maternity institution in Kiel replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions— eventually he committed suicide, however, because he felt {{responsible for the death}} of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.|$|E
25|$|As {{accounts}} of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine <b>washings</b> would be widely adopted, saving {{tens of thousands of}} lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. James Young Simpson, for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis's groundbreaking findings and the British idea suggested by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1843 that childbed fever was contagious (i.e. that infected persons could pass the infection to others). Indeed, initial responses to Semmelweis's findings were that he had said nothing new.|$|E
25|$|After {{filtering}} {{any remaining}} solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally {{used in this}} role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the <b>washings</b> from affination and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Hand {{contamination}} is {{an important}} factor of infection transmission from dental staff to patients and vice versa. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of hand washing training on dental students’ knowledge, attitude, and clinical practice at the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Dental School in 2010. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 100 volunteers studying in the 6 th, 7 th, 8 th, and 11 th semesters in the Shahid Beheshti Dental School. A standardized questionnaire was used after confirmation of its content validity and reliability as the study tool. All students were assessed twice: once before (pretest) and once after the training (post-test) of hand washing techniques. The scores of pretest and post-test were compared and analyzed by paired T test and by repeated measured analysis of variance test (RMA) by means of SPSS- 15 program. Results: A total of 100 students (38 boys and 62 girls) participated in this study. The difference between the mean scores of dental students’ knowledge before (13. 73 ± 2. 76) and after training (19. 64 ± 2. 53) was found to be significant (p< 0. 001). With regard to their attitudes, the mean scores related to before (25. 21 ± 2. 31) and after training (26. 63 ± 2. 08) were significantly different (p< 0. 001). Meanwhile, the participants showed significantly improved hand washing technique after training (p< 0. 001). RMA scores showed no significant difference between the male and female students in terms of their knowledge and attitudes, although the clinical practice of boys was better than that of girls (p= 0. 017). However, the academic grades of the students (semesters) had no effect on their attitude, knowledge, and hand washing techniques. Conclusions: Training about hand washing techniques can improve the knowledge, attitude, and clinical practices of dental students, regardless of their grade.

[...] He pointed out that ordinary <b>washings</b> with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such <b>washings.</b> [...] When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they {{came into contact with}} the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process. [...] Semmelweis was convinced that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. [...] With this etiology, Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an iatrogenic diseasethat is, one caused by doctors.
