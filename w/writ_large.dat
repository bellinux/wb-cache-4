5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society <b>writ</b> <b>large.</b> A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} and document a new principle of economic behavior: {{the principle of}} the Malevolent Hiding Hand. In a famous discussion, Albert Hirschman celebrated the Hiding Hand, which he saw as a benevolent mechanism by which unrealistically optimistic planners embark on unexpectedly challenging plans, only to be rescued by human ingenuity, which they could not anticipate, but which ultimately led to success, principally in the form of unexpectedly high net benefits. Studying eleven projects, Hirschman suggested that the Hiding Hand is a general phenomenon. But the Benevolent Hiding Hand has an evil twin, the Malevolent Hiding Hand, which blinds excessively optimistic planners not only to unexpectedly high costs but also to unexpectedly low net benefits. Studying a much larger sample than Hirschman did, we find that the Malevolent Hiding Hand is common and that the phenomenon that Hirschman identified is rare. This sobering finding suggests that Hirschman’s phenomenon is a special case; it attests to the pervasiveness of the planning fallacy, <b>writ</b> very <b>large.</b> One implication involves the continuing need to de-bias decisions and decision support tools like cost-benefit analysis; another is that accountability for decision makers, planners, and forecasters is required for such de-biasing to be effective and lasting...|$|R

But the essential question with which I leave Avi-Yonahs work is: Why does it matter? The principal flaw in Avi-Yonahs argument is that it consistently operates at the level of high theory while failing to contextualize the theoretical debate in a way that might elucidate for us theorys importance. While he takes us through all of the standard cases, he disregards the purposes for which theory was used in each. For corporate theory in the context of constitutional law is about the power relationship between the corporation and the state, while corporate theory in the context of corporate law is about the relationship between directors and shareholders, and thus the distribution of power within the corporation. One set of theories is largely independent of the other, as clear as the contrast between the Progressive Era theoretical literature Avi-Yonah cites, and Berle and Meanss "The Modern Corporation and Private Property". What difference does it make? Constitutional law is about power within politics, <b>writ</b> both <b>large</b> and small. Corporate law is about power within business.

40|$|Debates {{about the}} proper {{boundaries}} of a lawyer’s role are far from new. A fresh spin on this old debate, however, has emerged with the 2 ̆ 2 positivist turn 2 ̆ 2 in legal ethics theory. While in legal theory scholarship the label 2 ̆ 2 positivism 2 ̆ 2 carries various nuances and controversies, its use in the legal ethics context is, as a general matter, more straightforward and uniform. Broadly speaking, positivist accounts of legal ethics share a general view that the law owes its normative content to its ability to solve coordination problems and settle moral controversies. This view of the law, in turn, informs a particular view of the lawyer as governed in her actions by the legal entitlements at issue, as opposed to, for example, considerations of morality or justice <b>writ</b> at <b>large.</b> Because the positivist account grounds a theory of legal ethics in respect for the law, it seems {{safe to assume that}} the law governing lawyers is properly viewed as playing a central role in this account. Stated otherwise, the same 2 ̆ 2 fidelity to law 2 ̆ 2 that lawyers must exhibit when, for example, interpreting tax codes to advise clients on structuring financial transactions is presumably also required when a lawyer is interpreting how the rules of professional conduct apply to her situation. What has not been given much, if any, attention is how the law governing lawyers is different from other types of law and how this difference may be consequential for the positivist account. The law governing lawyers does not simply have the status of law (and therefore, assumes {{a central role in the}} positivist account), it also addresses the same subject matter — the proper bounds of lawyer behavior — that legal ethics theory itself purports to address. As a consequence, two of the 2 ̆ 2 typical 2 ̆ 2 questions or challenges lobbied at positivist accounts of law — what to do when: (1) following the law leads to unpalatable outcomes; or (2) the law at issue contains moral terms — give rise to some outstanding questions in the case of positivist legal ethics theory. Below, some very preliminary thought is given to how these puzzles might be 2 ̆ 2 solved. 2 ̆ 2 Ultimately, however, the main goal of this Idea is to highlight these issues as ripe for further consideration and critique...|$|R
