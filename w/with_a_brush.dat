5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E

Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E

25|$|The {{gallbladder}} wall {{is composed}} {{of a number of}} layers. The gallbladder wall's innermost surface is lined by a single layer of columnar cells <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> border of microvilli, very similar to intestinal absorptive cells. Underneath the epithelium is an underlying lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. Unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that the Shang people also wrote with brush and ink, as brush-written graphs have been found on {{a small number of}} pottery, shell and bone, and jade and other stone items, and there is {{evidence}} that they also wrote on bamboo (or wooden) books just like those found from the late Zhou to Hàn periods, because the graphs for a writing brush (聿 yù, depicting a hand holding a writing brush) and bamboo book (冊 cè, a book of thin vertical slats or slips with horizontal string binding, like a Venetian blind turned 90 degrees) are present in the oracle bone script. Since the ease of writing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> is even greater than that of writing with a stylus in wet clay, it is assumed that the style and structure of Shang graphs on bamboo were similar to those on bronzes, and also that the majority of writing occurred <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> on such books. Additional support for this notion includes the reorientation of some graphs, by turning them 90 degrees as if to better fit on tall, narrow slats; this style must have developed on bamboo or wood slat books and then carried over to the oracle bone script.|$|E
25|$|Shū 書 {{refers to}} Chinese calligraphy, which {{dates to the}} origins of {{recorded}} Chinese history, in essence ever since written characters have existed. Chinese calligraphy {{is said to be}} an expression of a practitioner's poetic nature, as well as a significant test of manual dexterity. Chinese calligraphy has evolved for thousands of years, and its state of flux stopped only when Chinese characters were unified across the empire. Chinese calligraphy differs from western calligraphic script {{in the sense that it}} was done <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> instead of metal implements or a quill. Calligraphy was the art by which a scholar could compose his thoughts to be immortalized. It was the scholar's means of creating expressive poetry and sharing his or her own learnedness.|$|E

50|$|Its density, {{similar to}} that of gold, allows {{tungsten}} to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum. Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic, and is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brushed</b> finish.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the first}} boiler tubes, {{particularly}} the du Temple with its sharp corners, could not be cleaned of scale internally. Tubes were later cleaned internally by attempting to pass a hinged rod through, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> at the end. For the curved tube designs, often {{only part of the}} tube could be reached. Another method was to pass a chain down the tube from above, pulling a brush behind it, although this was unworkable for boilers like the Thornycroft where the tubes first travelled horizontally or upwards. The eventual method was to use 'bullet' brushes that were fired from one drum into the other by use of compressed air. Sets of brushes were used, one for each tube, and they were carefully numbered and counted afterwards to ensure that none had been left behind, blocking a tube.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, put simply, {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush,</b> using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of the country milk is offered along with {{crystallized}} sugar, rice pudding (kheer in local parlance). A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes {{to come out of the}} anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.|$|E

25|$|The new {{technique}} had the primary advantage of permitting {{a far better}} execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of detail <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush.</b> Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure silhouettes. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and of youthful age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, the Jiǎgǔwén {{characters}} {{carved on}} ox scapula and tortoise plastrons showed {{no indication of}} stroke order. The characters show huge variations from piece to piece, sometimes even within one piece. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> on the shell or bone (to be carved in a workshop later). Although the brush-written stroke order is not discernible after carving, there exists some evidence {{that it was not}} entirely idiosyncratic: a few of the characters, often marginal administrative notations recording the provenance of the shells or bones, were not later recarved, and the stroke order of these characters tends to resemble traditional and modern stroke order. For those characters (the vast majority) which were later engraved into the hard surface using a knife, perhaps by a separate individual, there is evidence (from incompletely engraved pieces) that in at least some cases all the strokes running one way were carved, then the piece was turned, and strokes running another way were then carved.|$|E
25|$|By 1951, Krasner {{started her}} first series of collage paintings. To create these images, Krasner pasted cut and torn shapes onto {{all but two}} of the {{large-scale}} color field paintings she created for the Betty Parson's exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when Krasner stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor. To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through these collages. These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the cyclic fatigue resistance of Mtwo NiTi rotary instruments when used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brushing</b> or no-brushing action in oval root canals. Methodology: Cyclic fatigue testing of instruments {{was performed in}} tapered artificial canals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5 mm radius of curvature and an angle of curvature of 60 °. Twenty Mtwo instruments for each size were selected and divided into two groups: group A = 10 instruments used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> no-brushing motion (control group); group B = 10 instruments used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brushing-milling action. Each Mtwo instrument was used for cleaning and shaping 10 oval root canals. In all 80 instruments were rotated until fracture occurred {{and the number of}} cycles to failure (NCF) recorded. Data were analysed by one-way anova, Tukey HSD test and independent sample t-test to determine any statistical difference; the significance was determined at the 95 % confidence level. Results: No statistically significant reduction of NCF between instruments used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> no-brushing motion (group A) and instruments used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brushing</b> motion (group B) were apparent except for size 25, 0. 06 taper. Mtwo size 10, 0. 04 taper, size 15, 0. 05 taper, size 20, 0. 06 taper, size 25, 0. 06 taper instruments had a decrease in life span of 1 %, 0. 5 %, 8 % and 19 %, respectively. Conclusions: Fatigue life of instruments of larger size could be reduced by using them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lateral <b>brushing</b> or pressing movement. However, each file was successfully operated without intracanal failure, demonstrating that Mtwo rotary instruments can be used safely in <b>a</b> <b>brushing</b> action in simulated clinical conditions up to 10 times in oval canals. © 2007 International Endodontic Journal...|$|R

500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen.

Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E
