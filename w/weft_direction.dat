40|$|Three common 3 D (Three Dimensional) Glass woven {{structures}} were studied {{to analyze the}} tensile behavior. Each type of strand (Warp, weft and binder) of 3 D woven structure was studied in detail. Crimp percentage of those strands was measured by crimp meter. Standard size samples of each 3 D woven structure were cut in warp and <b>weft</b> <b>direction</b> and were stretched by Instron Tensile testing computerized machine. Results reveal that hybrid possesses lowest crimp in core strands and higher strength in warp as well as <b>weft</b> <b>direction.</b> Layer to layer woven structure appeared with lower strength and higher strain value due to highest crimp percentage in core strands...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) model was used for predicting colour properties of 100 % cotton fabrics, including colour yield (in terms of K/S value) and CIE L, a, and b values, {{under the influence of}} laser engraving process with various combination of laser processing parameters. Variables examined in the ANN model included fibre composition, fabric density (warp and <b>weft</b> <b>direction),</b> mass of fabric, fabric thickness and linear density of yarn (warp and <b>weft</b> <b>direction).</b> The ANN model was compared with a linear regression model where the ANN model produced superior results in prediction of colour properties of laser engraved 100 % cotton fabrics. The relative importance of the examined factors influencing colour properties was also investigated.

40|$|The dye {{ability of}} the Jute/Cotton union fabric with cotton yarn in the warp and Jute: Cotton yarns in the <b>weft</b> <b>direction</b> were studied with {{different}} percentage of Jute/Cotton blend in <b>weft</b> <b>direction.</b> The K/S and colour tristimulus values of (reactive dye) the different formulations (Jute/cotton: 30 : 70, 40 : 60, 50 : 50 and 70 : 30) after and before the softening finish were studied. The experiment focuses {{on the effect of}} jute content on the colour strength and fastness properties of finished fabric. The result reveals that, the colour strength value (K/S) was higher in the case of fabric proportion with more jute (70 : 30 jute/cotton). The finishing process has significant influence on the colour strength value (p< 0. 05). The fastness properties including light, washing, rubbing and perspiration of dyed fabrics were also satisfactory. To analyse the effect of jute proportion on colour strength and the effect of finishing on colour value, ANOVA was performed...|$|E

30|$|The {{breaking}} load of a fabric {{in either the}} warp or <b>weft</b> <b>direction</b> is primarily determined by {{the strength of the}} yarn. The other important fabric variables effecting strength of woven fabrics are fiber properties, yarn properties, warp and weft densities, fabric weave, crimp and finishing process. Fabric strength tends to increase as the thread densities in both directions increase (Greenwood 1975; Adanur 2001; Mohamed and Lord 1973; Lee et al. 1996; Bassett et al. 1999; Cook 2001).|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development and}} the characterization of composite material (laminate) containing natural jute fiber reinforcement. Thermal characterization of jute fiber reinforcement shows {{the influence of the}} temperature on the mechanical behavior of fiber. At 180 C the jute fabric loses 50 % of its mechanical characteristics. The laminate obtained by a process known as infusion is polymerized at a temperature lower than that which affects the mechanical properties of dry fabric. The digital image correlation carried out on laminated jute/epoxy (warp and <b>weft</b> <b>direction)</b> under tensile test shows the presence of a considerable gradient of deformation. This gradient is explained by the variability related to the local voluminal change of jute fibers of one place to the other {{and the nature of the}} weaving of the jute fiber. The three-point bending tests show a significant dispersion of rupture stress. The thermomechanical tests carried out on samples in the two principal directions, show that the thermal coefficient of expansion in warp direction is 48 % larger compared to the <b>weft</b> <b>direction.</b> The thermogravimetric test shows that this laminate absorbs up to 4 % water mass after 8 h in a climatic chamber with 70 % moisture conten...|$|E
