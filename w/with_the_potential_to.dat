5|$|The 6.9 {{earthquake}} of 11 March 2010 occurred {{two weeks}} after the 27 February event. Chilean seismologists, including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological Service, had suggested that the absence of an aftershock greater than magnitude 6 following the February 27 quake indicated that there remained energy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> be released. Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March: one reached magnitude 5.7, and the other magnitude 5.2; both were felt between the Valparaíso and Maule regions.|$|E

When Leo's closed in February 2014, rumors had already circulated about restaurateur and developer Dayna McErlean's {{plans to open a}} more upscale diner. The Dime Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by the soda shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve breakfast and lunch during mid-week hours, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> later add happy hour and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E
5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were {{planning}} to start production on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated {{that the rest of}} the major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date.|$|E

The group is captured by the Master Builder, the most powerful individual Forerunner and creator of the Halos, but he is arrested and Bornstellar is called to provide evidence at the Master Builder's trial.

5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> provide details of Allied naval movements.

The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused {{to provide them with}} any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
