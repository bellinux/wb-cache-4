Tracy phones a morning television phone-in show (hosted by Michael Thomas and Helen Atkinson-Wood, with appearances by Rachael Fielding and Jonathan Barlow), and when she realises that the show's divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role (with a heavy Northern accent, actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett's own voice) to give herself advice on the other line. Bennett says this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> thing she has had to do in her career.|$|E
5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, Hellen meandered around northern Mozambique {{and produced}} prolonged heavy rains over the region. The city of Pemba in Cabo Delgado Province <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit area, with the Messalo River over-topping its banks. Tagir Carimo, mayor of Pemba, described the rains as the heaviest {{he had seen}} in 20years. More than 100poorly constructed homes collapsed in the floods while severe erosion exposed and destroyed water pipes. A major bridge connecting Pemba to surrounding areas was washed away by the Messalo river. This isolated the northern portion of Cabo Delgado Province {{from the rest of the}} country, forcing ferries to transport cars. Three people died in the district of Cariaco when their home collapsed while a fourth drowned in Chiuba. Distributing assistance following the storm was disrupted by damaged roads.|$|E

5|$|In the 2004–05 season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool {{once again}} make the {{play-off}}s. During the play-off semi-final against Tranmere, Humphreys had {{the task of}} taking a penalty for Hartlepool in sudden death. This {{was the first time}} Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham. This time he scored and sent Hartlepool through to the play-off final against his old club Sheffield Wednesday at the Millennium Stadium. This helped to erase the memories of Cheltenham. However, Hartlepool lost the play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday. Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> to take. Before {{the end of the season}} Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.|$|E

Bill Ponsford said that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hitting he had ever seen. The Third Test was Miller's first in his home town. He had a mediocre game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{impact was}} minimal; {{although}} 15tropical cyclones developed, most were weak or remained at sea. Tropical Storm Andrea killed four people after making landfall in Florida and {{moving up the}} East Coast of the United States. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. Tropical storms Dorian and Erin and Hurricane Humberto brought only squally weather to the Cape Verde Islands. Mexico, where Hurricane Ingrid, Tropical Depression Eight, and tropical storms Barry and Fernand all made landfall, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit; Ingrid alone caused at least 32deaths and $1.5billion (2013USD) in damage. In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{weakening}} to {{a severe}} tropical storm before landfall, Prapiroon brought torrential rains and flooding which left 88 people dead and eight others missing. About 10million people {{were affected by}} the typhoon, while 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged. Damages from the typhoon were estimated at $984million (2006USD; $1.1billion 2008USD).

25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
