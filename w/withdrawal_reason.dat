40|$|Through a {{qualitative}} interview process, this research sought {{to fill a}} gap in the student withdrawal from college literature and to bring clarity to and additional understanding of how personal and family issues contributed to student withdrawal. Research participants were students of sophomore, junior, or senior class standing at a Midwestern university. This study filled a void in current research on student departure because it examined how a particular segment of the withdrawing student population, namely those who cited personal or family hardships, came to the conclusion to withdraw. According to institutional data of withdrawal in Fall 2002 - 03, a total of 382 students withdrew from all of their courses. Personal was the top-ranking reason chosen by students as their reason for withdrawal and was selected by 92 students, followed by employment (72); medical (56); financial (44); transferring (43); family (40); academic (15); dissatisfied (11); military (6); and no reason (3). As a category of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reason,</b> personal was chosen more by women than men, 59 percent to 41 percent, respectively, according to university data. In interviews, students described the personal or family issues that affected their ability to remain enrolled; recalled when, how, and through whose advice, support, or guidance they arrived at their decision to withdraw; described their college experiences and sense of support within the institution; reflected on their decision to withdraw and considered what, if anything, they or the institution could have done to prevent the withdrawal; and discussed their short- and long-range plans for education. The resulting evidence provided an understanding of these students' feelings, choices, decisions, perceived options, and reflections about their decision to withdraw from classes in a time of personal or family difficulty. Conclusions and recommendations arising through this research held significance for institutional approaches to working with students who withdraw during a semester.

As dogs age different behavioural issues occur and in some cases dogs may be relinquished or removed from their working service. Here we analyse a dataset on working guide dogs that were removed from their service between 1994 and 2013. We use the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reasons</b> as a proxy for the manifestation of undesirable behaviour. More than 7, 500 dogs were in the dataset used, 83 % of which were retired (due to old age) and 17 % were withdrawn for behavioural issues. We found that the main <b>reasons</b> for behaviour <b>withdrawal</b> were environmental anxiety, training, and fear/aggression. Breed and sex had an effect on the odds of dogs being withdrawn under the different reasons. The age at withdrawal for the different <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reasons</b> suggested that dogs were more likely to develop fear/aggression related issues early on, whilst issues related to training could develop at almost any age. We found no evidence for heterosis effecting behaviour. We believe that this work is relevant to the pet dog population and had implications for understanding ageing and genetic influences on behaviour...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{characterize}} participant {{reasons for}} withdrawing from a diabetes focused longitudinal clinical observational trial (TEDDY) {{during the first}} three study years. METHODS: 8677 children were recruited into the TEDDY study. At participant withdrawal staff recorded any reason parents provided for <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Reasons</b> were categorized into (1) family characteristics and (2) protocol reasons. Families who informed staff of their withdrawal were classified as active withdrawals (AW); families without a final contact were considered passive withdrawals (PW). RESULTS: Withdrawal was highest during the first study year (n = 1220). Most families were AW (n = 1549; 73. 4 %). PW was more common in the United States (n = 1001; 37. 8 %) and among young mothers (p = 0. 001). The most frequent protocol characteristic was blood draw (55 %) and the most common family reason was not having enough time (66 %). The blood draw was more common among female participants; being too busy was more common among males. Both reasons were associated with study satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that, for families of children genetically at risk for diabetes, procedures that can be painful/frightening should be used with caution.

In our study, we aimed to detect the incidence of catheter colonization and related parameters in patients with indwelling hemodialysis catheters. Material and Method: The data of 43 hemodialysis patients using temporary hemodialysis catheters were evaluated retrospectively. The relation between colonization and factors that affect catheter colonization such as catheter localization, life span of the catheter, accompanied disorders, antibiotic or intravenous iron use, presence of fever or leucocytosis and albumin concentration was investigated. Results: The life span of femoral (21), subclavian (14), and jugular (8) catheters were 17. 9 ± 9. 9 days and bacterial growth was detected in 15 (34. 9 %) of the catheters. The most common determined pathogen was staphylococci (60 %). Catheter <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reasons</b> were as follows: the most common reason was suspicion of catheter infection in culture positive group (40 %) and recovery from acute renal failure (42. 9 %) in culture negative group.

40|$|Background Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (SHPT) is {{a common}} complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Cinacalcet could be a therapeutic option although its use is controversial in patients not receiving dialysis. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of cinacalcet in patients with CKD and SHPT without renal replacement treatment (RRT) and without renal transplantation (RT). Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted. Patients were included if they had collected cinacalcet, under off-label use, during 2010 and 2011. Patients selected were followed from the beginning of cinacalcet therapy for one year of treatment. Results A total of 37 patients were included with CKD stage 3 (38 %), 4 (51 %) and 5 (11 %). Baseline mean PTH value was 400. 86 ± 168. 60 mg/dl. At 12 months, a 67 % of patients achieved at least a 30 % reduction in their PTH value (p< 0. 001; CI 49. 7 - 83. 6), and the overall mean reduction of PTH values was 38 % (p< 0. 001; IC - 49. 1, - 27. 5). A 28 % of the patients achieved KDOQI PTH goals (p = 0. 003, CI 12 %- 50 %). At 12 months, mean serum calcium values decreased by 6 % and mean serum phosphorus values increased by 13 %. A 19 % of patients experienced hypocalcemia episodes while an increase of 24 % in hyperphosphatemia episodes was observed. A 25 % of patients finished cinacalcet before a year of treatment. Main <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reasons</b> were: gastrointestinal and other discomfort (8 %), hypocalcaemia (8 %), non-compliance (3 %), interactions (3 %) and excess of efficacy (3 %).

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effect of capital requirements on commercial banks {{and the impact of}} commercial bank suspensions on the United States economy during the early 20 th century. 	The first chapter examines {{the effect of}} capital requirements on bank stability. The early 20 th century United States provides an opportunity to determine whether imposing capital requirements on commercial banks promotes banking stability in the long run. The structure of the national banking system facilitates inference using a regression discontinuity design. I find that banks subject to higher capital requirements did hold more capital, but also increased lending proportionately so that their leverage and risk of failure remained roughly unchanged. Ultimately, capital requirements did not result in lower suspension rates. 	The second chapter investigates the role of national bank capital requirements as a barrier to entry as a case study for California. Previous studies focusing on national banks find that rural bankers operated as price discriminating monopolist. However, by 1900 over half of the banks in the US were state banks. Bank and town level data is gathered for California to explore the impact of capital requirements on banking markets one year after state regulators began implementing capital requirements. The data suggest capital requirements do not alter the composition of capital in local banking markets during this time period. The majority of state banks still held capital levels similar to national banks even when they were subject to lower capital requirements. 	The third chapter analyzes the impact of bank failures on wholesale activity at the county-level during the Great Depression. A propensity score model is used to mitigate the endogeneity issue between bank suspensions and wholesale activity. I find that counties experiencing bank suspensions during panic periods experience an eight to ten percent decline in wholesale sales relative to similar counties that did not experience suspensions during panic periods. In addition, data is gathered from bank examiners’ reports to observe which types of bank failures have an adverse impact on wholesale activity. I find banks failing due to asset and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>reasons</b> have a large negative impact on wholesale activity. anics...|$|R

These drugs are recommended for short-term use only, but many studies report long-term use, particularly in older people. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to identify and synthesise qualitative studies exploring patients’ experiences and perceptions of receiving benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, and through this identify factors which perpetuate use of these drugs, and strategies for achieving safer prescribing. Methods A systematic search of six databases for qualitative studies exploring patients’ experiences and perceptions of primary care benzodiazepine and z-drug prescribing published between January 2000 and April 2014 in a European language, and conducted in Europe, the United States, Australia or New Zealand. Reference lists of included papers were also searched. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist. Findings were synthesised using thematic synthesis. Results Nine papers were included and seven analytical themes were identified relating to patients’ experiences and perceptions and, within that, strategies for safer prescribing of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs: (1) patients’ negative perceptions of insomnia and its impact, (2) failed self-care strategies, (3) triggers to medical help-seeking, (4) attitudes towards treatment options and service provision, (5) varying patterns of use, (6) <b>withdrawal,</b> (7) <b>reasons</b> for initial or ongoing use.

[...] Meanwhile, Noli De Castro on television stated: [...] "This is the triumph of truth. The truth that I won fair and square. I thank the Supreme Court for echoing the true voice of the people. From the very beginning I was confident that I received the overwhelming mandate of our people as Vice President." [...] Legarda stated that she will file a motion for reconsideration in due course.|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} the elderly who were {{benzodiazepine}} dependent found withdrawal could be carried out with few complications and could lead to improvements in sleep and cognitive abilities. At 52 weeks after successful withdrawal, a 22% improvement in cognitive status was found, as well as improved social functioning. Those who remained on benzodiazepines experienced a 5% decline in cognitive abilities, {{which seemed to be}} faster than that seen in normal aging, suggesting the longer the intake of benzodiazepines, the worse the cognitive effects become. Some worsening of symptoms were seen in {{the first few months of}} benzodiazepine abstinence, but at a 24-week followup, elderly subjects were clearly improved compared to those who remained on benzodiazepines. Improvements in sleep were seen at the 24- and 52-week followups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related rebound insomnia. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as episodic memory did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year followup showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after <b>withdrawal.</b> The <b>reason</b> it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen after cessation of benzodiazepine use was due to the time it takes the brain to adapt to the benzodiazepine-free environment.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{these reports}} Butler {{determined}} to withdraw his {{troops from the}} peninsula {{and return to the}} fleet. At that time there had not been a man on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet. Curtis had got within a few yards of the works. Some of his men had snatched a flag from the parapet of the fort, and others had taken a horse from the inside of the stockade. At night Butler informed Porter of his <b>withdrawal,</b> giving the <b>reasons</b> above stated, and announced his purpose as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads. Porter represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for more ammunition. He could fire much faster than he had been doing, and would keep the enemy from showing himself until our men were within twenty yards of the fort, and he begged that Butler would leave some brave fellows like those who had snatched the flag from the parapet and taken the horse from the fort.|$|R
40|$|In an open {{multicentre}} study designed to closely reflect the clinical situation, 315 out-patients diagnosed by their psychiatrist as having depression and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and/or panic disorder, were treated for 12 weeks with fluvoxamine (100 - 300 mg/day). Twelve weeks of fluvoxamine therapy {{was completed by}} 229 (73 %) patients. Longer illness duration prior to treatment {{was associated with a}} significantly reduced rate of treatment withdrawal, whereas a diagnosis of OCD was predictive of treatment <b>withdrawal.</b> The main <b>reasons</b> patients discontinued fluvoxamine therapy were adverse effects experienced before Week 8, and clinical improvement thereafter. Age, sex, and diagnosis had no predictive value for treatment outcome; however, psychiatric antecedents and duration and severity of illness at baseline were significant predictors of disease severity at endpoint. Fluvoxamine decreased both the frequency and severity of baseline symptoms, with improvement continuing {{for the duration of the}} study. Nausea was the only symptom to show an initial increase in frequency and severity, but this subsided after 4 weeks to levels below baseline frequency and severity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|That {{the issue}} of ageing {{is going to be}} high on the agenda of Australian governments and {{community}} interests {{for at least the next}} four decades is clear and well understood. Despite successive waves of government-driven reforms in financing, planning, provision and standards, extending now over two decades, we still have serious problems of staff recruitment and retention in this area, problems which, on present indications, are likely to peak at about the same time in the not-too-distant future as the demand pressures reach a new level of intensity. There is still a measure of uncertainty about some dimensions of the aged care workforce despite recent scholarly attempts to clarify the situation (Richardson & Martin, 2004). However it can be agreed that rates of RN retirement and <b>withdrawal</b> for other <b>reasons</b> will exceed RN recruitment rates and thereby maintain pressure on the labour force supply side. That there are several causes of this declining trajectory is clear; that a widespread rejection of the actual or anticipated aged care clinical experience by student nurses is one of those several causes is equally certain...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{test whether}} {{satisfaction}} with taking medication, assessed using item 15 of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), {{is associated with}} clinical outcome and persistence with treatment. Method: In this post hoc analysis, data were analyzed from 4 randomized placebo-controlled studies of patients with major depressive disorder treated with escitalopram (650 patients taking escitalopram and 534 taking placebo), together with data from 2 randomized trials of escitalopram versus venlafaxine or duloxetine (235 patients taking escitalopram and 233 taking a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). The studies were published between 2002 and 2007. Instruments included the Q-LES-Q, which was assessed at baseline and week 8, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which was assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Results: At baseline, the mean ± SD MADRS total score was 30. 0 ± 4. 6, and the mean Q-LES-Q item 15 score was 2. 9 ± 0. 9. At week 8, the MADRS response rates of placebo-treated patients with a low, moderate, or high satisfaction with medication at baseline were 30 %, 37 %, and 46 %, respectively (mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). The corresponding MADRS response rates for escitalopram-treated patients with a low, moderate, or high satisfaction at baseline were 56 %, 60 %, and 67 %, respectively (MMRM). Baseline satisfaction with medication was not significantly correlated with time to <b>withdrawal</b> (all <b>reasons).</b> The change in satisfaction with medication from baseline to endpoint was significantly correlated with symptomatic improvement on the MADRS (P <. 001). Conclusions: Baseline satisfaction with medication after 1 week of placebo run-in is a moderator of treatment outcome but not of persistence of treatment in the acute treatment phase of depressed outpatients. Patient attitude toward medication {{should be taken into}} account before treatment is initiated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Benzodiazepines and z-drugs {{can be used}} {{to manage}} insomnia, anxiety and pain. Despite only being {{recommended}} for short-term use, they are often prescribed long-term with potential for harm such as falls, accidents and dependence. We aimed to synthesise findings from qualitative studies of patients’ experiences and perceptions of seeking or receiving benzodiazepines and z-drugs in order to explore factors that perpetuate use of these drugs, and to identify possible strategies for achieving safer prescribing. Methods: We conducted a systematic review, searching literature in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, and AMED, for relevant qualitative studies published in a European language between January 2000 and April 2014. To be included in the review, studies needed to have been conducted in Europe, the United States, Australia or New Zealand. We also searched the reference lists of included studies. We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist, and synthesised findings using thematic synthesis. Results: We created seven analytical themes from the nine papers that were included in the review. These were 1) patients’ negative perceptions of insomnia and its impact, 2) failed self-care strategies, 3) triggers to medical help-seeking, 4) attitudes towards treatment options and service provision, 5) varying patterns of use, 6) <b>withdrawal,</b> 7) <b>reasons</b> for initial or ongoing use. Conclusion: From a patient perspective, prescribing of benzodiazepines and z-drugs is perpetuated by patients feeling psychologically dependent on them, perceiving there to be an absence of support to withdraw or use alternatives, and denying or being unaware of side-effects. Possible strategies for achieving safer prescribing are: education for patients and healthcare professionals using online resources, increasing the availability of alternatives, and extending the dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals...|$|R
