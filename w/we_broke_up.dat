According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up.</b> Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1942, Gavin {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (505th PIR) at Fort Benning which had been activated shortly before on July 6. He was, aged just 35, promoted to colonel shortly thereafter. Gavin built this regiment from the ground up. He led his troops on long marches and realistic training sessions, creating the training missions himself and leading the marches personally. He also placed great value on having his officers [...] "the first out of the airplane door and the last in the chow line". This practice has continued to and with present-day U.S. airborne units. After months of training, Gavin had the regiment tested one last time:As we neared our time to leave, {{on the way to}} war, I had an exercise that required them to leave our barracks area at 7:00 P.M. and march all night to an area near the town of Cottonwood, Alabama, a march about 23 miles. There we maneuvered all day and in effect we seized and held an airhead. <b>We</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> the exercise about 8:00 P.M. and started the troopers back by another route through dense pine forest, by way of backwoods roads. About 11:00 P.M., we went into bivouac. After about one hour's sleep, the troopers were awakened to resume the march. [...] In 36 hours the regiment had marched well over 50 miles, maneuvered and seized an airhead and defended it from counterattack while carrying full combat loads and living off reserve rations.|$|E

It included four new studio songs, with [...] "Get Over It" [...] and [...] "Love Will Keep Us Alive" [...] both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996. In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, [...] "Take It Easy" [...] and [...] "Hotel California."

5000|$|Trim the Fat: The Gauntlet III Reunion was {{hosted by}} Lyndsey Rodrigues, filmed in New York, and premiered March 26, 2008. In this reunion show, several cast members discuss their {{experiences}} on the show. The most common topics of discussion are the various romances, backstabbing and deceit amongst the cast members. Frank and Jillian {{are still a}} couple and living together. Tori and Brad are together, though living apart. Johanna and <b>Wes</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up.</b> Paula and Derek decided to remain friends and Casey and Johnny are not a couple, nor are Ev and Brooke. Ev is told that Brooke is dating her ex-girlfriend, which Ev refuses to discuss. Although C.T. and Diem are not present, Katie tells everyone that they have broken up. Evan and Kenny say they are honeymooning in Mexico the next day. Coral heavily criticized Ev for betraying the women, but Ev says she didn't betray them but also didn't care if the men threw challenges {{to get rid of}} them. Evan openly mocks Lyndsey's view that Danny and Melinda were a [...] "power couple", saying Danny's opinion had 0% value to the Veterans. Both Rachel and Tori say that their conflicts with Frank were in the past, and Evan and Kenny praised Frank for digging for hours to retrieve the winning chest of money in the final challenge, saying Frank should have gotten an extra cut up to $100,000 of the final $300,000 prize. Some, however, noted he already had due to his relationship with fellow winner Jillian. Beth was heavily criticized, with Brad stating they wanted her out because she might have thrown missions, and Kenny telling Coral that everyone wanted her to defeat Beth in the Gauntlet. Rachel apparently began a relationship with Eric, but neither of them will confirm this. Johanna comments about Melinda's false belief that she was betrayed over the Gauntlet deliberations. Eric's failure in the final challenge is discussed, and it is revealed that only Brad, Coral, and Katie are still friends with him. Katie says she likes the fact that Kenny and Frank were blunt about her lack of ability, and hates duplicitous individuals. Coral and Ev do not part on amicable terms, and footage from the upcoming The Real World: Hollywood season is shown, thus ending the reunion.|$|R
6000|$|Harry {{was silent}} again for some time, and then said: [...] "The only plan I {{can think of}} is to get some strong leather bags. Then we could take one down with us when we dive, with a strong cord tied to it, put a couple of the ingots into it, and you could haul it up on to the rocks, and so on until we have {{finished}} a day's work. Then we could carry them to this side of the rocks; there you could put them, three or four at a time, into the bag, and drop them down in the water. We would swim up the tunnel and haul them in, and then bring the bag back again. We sha'n't be able to get anything approaching all the ingots, for a great many of them must have gone in between the crevices of the rocks, and unless <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> it <b>up</b> with powder, which would be next to impossible without a diving-dress and air- pumps and all sorts of things, which cannot be bought in this country, we could not get at them. However, we have only just begun to look for them yet; we may come across a pile. Heavy as the sea must be on this coast in a gale, I hardly think it would much affect a pile of ingots; their weight would keep them steady even were big rocks rolled about.|$|R

America {{was a long way}} from England in those days. I regretted that I had not arrived in London in time to witness Lord Chatham's dramatic return to politics in January, when he had completed the work of Junius, and broken up the Grafton ministry.
