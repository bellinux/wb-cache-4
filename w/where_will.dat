David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} for the episode. While Will's actual {{proposal}} to Emma was received with more favor than not, the scene <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> asks Finn (Cory Monteith) {{to be his}} best man was roundly condemned: the notion that Will had no adult friends and would ask one of his students was inconceivable to many. There was acclaim for the subplot featuring Becky's (Lauren Potter) pursuit of Artie (Kevin McHale), and her mental voiceovers by Helen Mirren.|$|E

5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|They are soon {{captured}} by the police of the underground community, known as the Colony. In prison, Will is visited by Mr. Jerome, and his son Cal. They reveal Will was actually born in the Colony, {{and that they are}} his real family; Mr. Jerome his father and Cal his younger brother. Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself. Will refuses to abandon his friend, and Uncle Tam formulates a plan for him to rescue Chester and to take him back to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{places a}} hidden {{microphone}} {{in the interview}} room <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> Thoday and his sailor brother Jim are waiting. It becomes apparent that each brother thought the other was guilty of killing Deacon, but each {{was willing to take}} the blame himself or at least shield the other. When they are interviewed, Will relates that he encountered Deacon, who had come to retrieve the emeralds, in the church on 30 December. Will had married Mary after the war, believing her a widow. Now he realised Deacon was still alive, making his and Mary's marriage bigamous and their daughters illegitimate. Desperate to prevent Deacon from exposing his family to pain and scandal, Will tied him up in the bell-chamber, planning to bribe him to leave, but became helpless with Spanish influenza next day. Will's delirious talk led Jim to find Deacon's body in the bell-chamber on 2 January. He assumed that Will had murdered him. Appalled but loyal, he waited until the night after Lady Thorpe's funeral on 4 January, made the body unrecognisable and hid it in the new grave, then left for sea. When the body was discovered, Will assumed Jim had killed Deacon. Neither can explain how Deacon died. Both are released. Will marries Mary again in Bloomsbury and they return to Fenchurch St. Paul.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E
500|$|During the end, [...] "Ghost" [...] quickly {{transitions}} into [...] "Haunted" [...] {{which contains}} elements of hip hop and R music. Kitty Empire of The Observer {{described it as}} a dance-pop track talking about [...] "being haunted in love". Instrumentally, it consists of percussion and an off-kilter club beat which was compared with Jacques Greene and Burial. Its sound is operatic and the lyrics undersung, with piano chords and various rhythmic effects, such as foot-tapping. Lyrically, it talks about desire, with Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk noting it was about [...] "frank sexual desires". The Village Voice Brittany Spanos felt the song was discussing lingering memories of the past. Trent Wolbe of The Verge compared the sound of [...] "Haunted" [...] with music by bands The Knife, Sade and Boards of Canada. Andrew Barker from Variety found a trance genre similar to Madonna's Bedtime Stories. The song includes sexual lyrics that are reflected throughout the album, including, [...] "The bedroom's my runway / Slap me! / I'm pinned to the doorway / Kiss, bite, foreplay" [...] and [...] "My wicked tongue / <b>Where</b> <b>will</b> it be?" [...] set to [...] "sonorous... and chilly charged beats".|$|E
500|$|There was broad {{agreement}} {{regarding the}} scene <b>where</b> <b>Will</b> asks Finn {{to be his}} best man: not one reviewer approved. Lynch called it [...] "questionable" [...] and said it crossed a [...] "line of weirdness", Slezak and TV Guide Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate, if not unethical, and Bell said the actual request was the episode's [...] "biggest WTF?! moment". Will's statement that Finn had taught him [...] "more about being a man" [...] was met with incredulity. Slezak declared [...] "Finn {{has a lot of}} growing up to do before he's really a man", and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted [...] "like a petulant man-boy" [...] on the show, Will must have been referring to events in [...] "a season of Glee that didn't air". Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter, however; she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father [...] "one of Cory Monteith's best scenes yet", and Slezak described it as [...] "beautifully handled" [...] by Monteith. Finn's marriage proposal to Rachel {{at the end of the}} episode was controversial. Reviewers thought it was a bad idea—Kubicek declared, [...] "No one in high school should get engaged"—but Poniewozik wrote that it [...] "made a lot of sense for Finn" [...] as a character, and VanDerWerff said the scene [...] "worked" [...] for him.|$|E
