40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} a novel sparse controller design for the temperature control of an experimental <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> <b>furnace</b> in steel industry. Adequate tracking of temperature references is essential for the quality of the heated slabs. However, the design of the temperature control is hindered by the multivariable (non-square) dynamic behavior of the furnace. These dynamics include significant loop interactions and time delays. Furthermore, a novel data-driven model, based on real life experimental data that relies on a subspace state representation in a closed loop approach is introduced. In the sequel, the derived model is utilized to investigate the controller's structure. By applying the relative gain array approach a decentralized feedback controller is designed. However, in spite of the optimal and sparse design of the controller, there exists interaction between loops. By analyzing the interaction between the inputs-outputs with the Σ 2 Gramian-based interaction methodology, a decoupled multi-variable controller is implied. The simulation result, based on the experimental modeling of the furnace, shows that the controller can successfully decrease the interaction between the loops and track the reference temperature set-points.

40|$|The <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> <b>furnace</b> (WBF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} process plants often met in an alloy steel production factory and characterized by high non-linearity, strong coupling, time delay, large time-constant and time variation in its parameter set and structure. From another viewpoint, the WBF is a distributed-parameter process in which the distribution of temperature is not uniform. Hence, this process plant has complicated non-linear dynamic equations that have not worked out yet. In this paper, we propose one-step non-linear predictive model for a real WBF using non-linear black-box sub-system identification based on locally linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) model. Furthermore, a multi-step predictive model with a precise long prediction horizon (i. e., ninety seconds ahead), developed with application of the sequential one-step predictive models, is also presented for the first time. The locally linear model tree (LOLIMOT) which is a progressive tree-based algorithm trains these models. Comparing the performance of the one-step LLNF predictive models with their associated models obtained through least squares error (LSE) solution proves that all operating zones of the WBF are of non-linear sub-systems. The recorded data from Iran Alloy Steel factory is utilized for identification and evaluation of the proposed neuro-fuzzy predictive models of the WBF process...|$|E

40|$|Furnaces {{that heat}} metal parts (blooms) prior to {{hot-working}} {{processes such as}} rolling or forging are called pre-forming reheat furnaces. In these furnaces, the fundamental idea is to heat the blooms to a prescribed temperature without very large temperature gradients in them. This is to ensure correct performance of the metal parts subsequent to reheating. Due to the elevated temperature in the furnace chamber, radiation is the dominant mode of heat transfer from the furnace to the bloom. In addition, there is convection heat transfer from the hot gases to the bloom. The heat transfer within the bloom is by conduction. In order to design a new furnace or to improve the performance of existing ones, the heat transfer analysis {{has to be done}} accurately. Given the complex geometry and large number of parameters encountered in the furnace, an analytical solution is difficult, and hence numerical modeling has to be resorted to. In the present work, a numerical technique for modelling the steady-state and transient heat transfer in a reheat furnace is developed. The work mainly involves the development of a radiation heat transfer analysis code for a reheat furnace, since {{a major part of the}} heat transfer in the furnace chamber is due to radiation from the roof and combustion gases. The code is modified from an existing finite volume method (FVM) based radiation heat transfer solver, The existing solver is a general purpose radiation heat transfer solver for enclosures and incorporates the following features: surface-to-surface radiation, gray absorbing-emitting medium in the enclosure, multiple reflections off the bounding walls, shadowing effects due to obstructions in the enclosure, diffuse reflection and enclosures with irregular geometry. As a part of the present work, it has now been extended to include the following features that characterise radiation heat transfer in the furnace chamber · Combination of specular and diffuse reflection as is the case with most real surfaces · Participating non-gray media, as the combustion gases in the furnace chamber exhibit highly spectral radiative characteristics Transient 2 D conduction heat transfer within the metal part is then modelled using a FVM-based code. Radiation heat flux from the radiation model and convection heat flux calculated using existing correlations act as boundary conditions for the conduction model. A global iteration involving the radiation model and the conduction model is carried out for the overall solution. For the study, two types of reheat furnaces were chosen; the pusher-type furnace and the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> <b>furnace.</b> The difference in the heating process of the two furnaces implies that they have to be modelled differently. In the pusher-type furnace, the heating of the blooms is only from the hot roof and the gas. In the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> <b>furnace,</b> the heating is also from the hearth and the blooms adjacent to any given bloom. The model can predict the bloom residence time for any particular combination of furnace conditions and load dimensions. The effects of variations of emissivities of the load, thickness of the load and the residence time of billet in the furnaces were studied...|$|E

40|$|Slab {{reheating}} {{characteristics in}} the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> type reheating <b>furnace</b> were studied {{by using the}} finite volume method (FVM). A geometry model for simulating the gas circulation, heat transfer and slabs reheating process in a reheating furnace was developed by using ANSYS FLUENT software. Usually, slabs are heated in the furnace, and temperature values of the slabs reach above 1, 500 K. After that, they are transported to the rolling mill. The slab reheating in a reheating furnace is influenced by many factors, such as gas velocity, moving speed of the slabs, and burner arrangement. Especially, the arrangement of burners shows a great effect on reheating the slabs. In the paper, the main object of study is to investigate the temperature distribution in the reheating furnace by considering {{the effect of the}} burner position. In addition, it is found that the temperature fields of the slabs are significantly affected by changing the positions of the burners...|$|R
40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the award of PhD of Loughborough University. During manufacturing, stainless steels will experience high temperatures at many steps: continuous casting, reheat, rolling and annealing. After continuous casting, it is usual for the ascast metal to cool to ambient temperatures. In order to achieve successful hot forming, the metal must then be reheated to a suitable temperature. This process is called "reheat", and commonly takes place in large, propane-fired <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> <b>furnaces</b> at temperatures in excess of 1200 °C for times of 2 or more hours. During reheat, a thick oxide scale will form which, if left in place during cold working, may cause damage {{to the surface of}} the final cold rolled product. As a result, manufacturers generally apply a mechanical descaling procedure immediately prior to rolling. In order to study the effect of reheat conditions on the oxide scale formation, austenitic grades (Types 316 L and 304) and duplex grades (Types S 32101 and S 32205) were oxidised. The temperatures used ranged from 700 °C through to 1300 °C for times up to, and including, 5 hours. The results of the heat treatments were investigated using a range of analytical techniques including: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and site specific cross-section preparation using focused ion beam for both SEM investigation and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The use of these techniques has provided a thorough description of oxides that are expected to form at a variety of temperatures and conditions. On austenitic grades a number of sub-surface oxide structures form, such as dendritic internal oxide particles and sub-surface oxide layering, which may pose great challenges to the mechanical descaling processes. External oxidation has not been neglected in this study and complex chemical and phase distributions within external oxide scales have been characterised. The presence of an as-cast oxide scale during reheat does not have a substantial effect on the reheat oxide formed, however, the as-cast microstructure may contribute to the formation of subsurface oxide banding. Duplex stainless steels produce oxides which are highly dependant on the phase distribution and surface finish of the substrate. Large scale oxide nodules have been found to form only on the austenite with an apparently protective thinner oxide present on the ferrite. The formation of these nodules has been studied from the initial stages of oxidation by the use of environmental SEM and site-specific preparation of important features to reveal that nodules form where the thin, protective chromium rich layer chemically fails during oxidation enabling local breakaway regions to form...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{mathematical}} {{heat transfer}} {{model for the}} prediction of transient heating of the slab in a direct-fired <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> type reheating <b>furnace</b> has been developed by considering the nongray thermal radiation with given furnace environments. The furnace is modeled as radiating nongray medium with carbon dioxide and water with five-zoned gas temperature and the furnace wall is considered as a constant temperature lower than furnace gas one. The slabs are moving with constant velocity depending on the residence time through the non-firing, charging, preheating, heating, and final soaking zones. Radiative heat flux obtained by considering the radiative heat exchange inside the furnace as well as convective one from the surrounding hot gases are introduced as boundary condition of the transient heat conduction within the slab. After validating thermal radiation model adopted in this work, thermal fields in both model and real reheating furnace are investigated in terms of radiative heat flux in the furnace and temperature inside the slab. The {{results show that the}} slab in the furnace can be more heated with higher slab emissivity and residence time...|$|R

2500|$|Walking beam engines {{remained}} {{popular with}} American shipping lines and excursion operations {{right into the}} early 20th century. Although the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine was technically obsolete in the later 19th century, it remained popular with excursion steamer passengers who expected to see the [...] "walking beam" [...] in motion. There were also technical reasons for retaining the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine in America, as {{it was easier to}} build, requiring less precision in its construction. [...] Wood could be used for the main frame of the engine, at a much lower cost than typical practice of using iron castings for more modern engine designs. Fuel was also much cheaper in America than in Europe, so the lower efficiency of the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine was less of a consideration. The Philadelphia shipbuilder Charles H. Cramp blamed America's general lack of competitiveness with the British shipbuilding industry in the mid-to-late 19th century upon the conservatism of American domestic shipbuilders and shipping line owners, who doggedly clung to outdated technologies like the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> and its associated paddlewheel long after they had been abandoned {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|R
