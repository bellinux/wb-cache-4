WebAIR was designed with <b>web</b> <b>developers</b> in mind, recognising their current working practices and acknowledging their existing understanding of web accessibility. We conducted an evaluation with 32 professional <b>web</b> <b>developers</b> in which they used either WebAIR or an existing accessibility information resource, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to identify accessibility problems.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{accessibility}} evaluation tools {{are available to}} support <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> in producing accessible Web resources. It is important that these tools support <b>web</b> <b>developers</b> very well, so that the developers can concentrate on the tasks of Web development. In addition, the tools should enhance <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> understanding of accessibility issues. This paper presents a usability evaluation of five entry level accessibility evaluations tools. A group heuristic evaluation was conducted, with 5 experts in usability and accessibility working through each tool together, but rating usability problems separately. The {{results showed that the}} usability of these tools is surprisingly poor and that they do not support <b>web</b> <b>developers</b> adequately in checking the accessibility of their web resources...|$|R

40|$|In Web system development, the {{non-functional}} requirements (NFRs) are typically considered only briefly during the requirements elicitation stage and not rigorously articulated by either <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> or the client. This paper reports on {{an investigation into}} this issue involving interviews with <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> who were engaged in commercial Web development projects. The results from this qualitative research highlight that <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> commonly do not pay sufficient attention to NFRs. This arises due to uncertainty, lack of time, lack of knowledge {{in the importance of}} NFRs and partly because NFRs are not readily available and documented from previous similar projects. <b>Web</b> <b>developers</b> also do not elicit NFR {{at the same time and}} at the same level of details as functional requirements (FRs). This study highlights that a lack of rigor in articulating NFRs may significantly impact on the development effectiveness and the quality of the resulting Web system...|$|R

His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a <b>web</b> <b>developer</b> built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router.

After The Digital Village closed, Grahame hosted the website himself and kept the domain alive. However, none of the domains ("starlightlines.com" [...] and [...] "starlightlines.net") currently work. Shortly after Starship Titanic, The Digital Village (which was renamed to h2g2) developed an online guide based on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy called h2g2, which became a BBC domain after the company shut down.|$|E
