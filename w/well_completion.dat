30|$|The {{obtained}} {{results indicate}} that the use of intelligent <b>well</b> <b>completions</b> is significantly profitable because the increase in NPV was highly significant. Increased cumulative oil production was the most effective factor contributing to the improvement in NPV.

25|$|The {{flight test}} {{program is to}} involve {{a total of three}} prototypes, {{designated}} P1, P2, and P3. The first prototype, P1, performed early test flights during {{the first phase of the}} flight test program, during which the handling and attitude of the aircraft were explored and the flight envelope gradually expanded, including autorotation tests and being flown at up to 97 per cent of its maximum internal load takeoff weight. P2 and P3 are the main vehicles for airworthiness certification testing; they are more representative of production aircraft, their design incorporating several refinements that had been made based upon experiences with P1. Following on from EASA certification, Marenco aims to quickly achieve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the North American market as <b>well.</b> <b>Completion</b> of P1 was reportedly delayed by as much as six months due to the late delivery of its engine by Honeywell. In December 2013, the completed P1 was revealed to the public.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} has been to develop new types of drill-in fluids (DIFs) and {{completion}} fluids (CFs) for use in natural gas reservoirs.

The project addresses the special problem of formation damage issues related to the use of CFs and DIFs in open hole horizontal <b>well</b> <b>completions.</b> The concept of a ''removable filtercake'' has, as its basis, a mechanism to initiate or trigger the removal process.

30|$|The latest {{intelligent}} fields include intelligent <b>well</b> <b>completions</b> {{capable of}} collecting downhole data, which allow the operator to selectively control completion intervals throughout {{the life of}} a reservoir. Performance can be monitored and optimized in real time and operations can be adjusted remotely using downhole equipment. To quantify and develop this potential, we deigned an algorithm-based system which is capable of optimizing intelligent well control to decide on whether or not to utilize intelligent well technology. Simulated annealing algorithm was used for obtaining an optimum control strategy and determining an operation that maximizes the net present value (NPV). In this article, we used more than 4, 000 simulation runs which were performed automatically in a reservoir simulator to optimize a cyclic production scenario with intelligent <b>well</b> <b>completions.</b> The intelligent <b>wells</b> were equipped with on/off inflow control valves in each zone, which were opened and closed sequentially to maximize the oil rate while not exceeding limits for water production. The results show that the application of simulated annealing algorithm for optimization of intelligent well technology culminates in an increase in the NPV through 14  % increase in cumulative oil production and a significant reduction in water production.|$|R
