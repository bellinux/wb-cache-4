Woodfull started the season by scoring 121 and leading his state to an 88-run win over the tourists ahead of the Tests. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> of what was to follow in the Tests. He then managed only 32 and nine as Victoria narrowly lost to South Australia by 21 runs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{subharmonic}} synthesizer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> device or {{system that}} generates subharmonics of <b>an</b> input <b>signal.</b> The nth subharmonic of <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> of fundamental frequency F <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> with frequency F/n.

5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much {{more expensive than the}} last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|The siege at the Peñol de Cerquín {{dragged on}} for months, with {{constant}} fighting. The Spanish there numbered about a hundred, plus auxiliaries, but were unable to maintain supply lines through the surrounding hostile territory, and were often short of food. The seasonal rains that arrived in spring 1538 only added to their hardship. The supplies from El Salvador finally arrived, and Cáceres slowly gained territory around the Peñol. After six months, Cáceres invited Lempira to a parley. Lempira arrived, dressed in full regalia, cotton armour, and plumed headdress, accompanied by a retinue of nobles. Cáceres sent a mounted soldier to request his surrender, and when Lempira refused, a carefully hidden arquebusier shot him through the head. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> for an all-out surprise attack by the Spanish. The Indians responded with complete panic at {{the death of their}} leader, and the Spanish onslaught swiftly took the fortress without any Spanish loss of life, although some were wounded. A portion of the indigenous garrison retreated to nearby mountains, but most of the Indians surrendered without further resistance, including a great many women, children and elderly. Cáceres followed Montejo's instructions in dealing with the defeated natives with moderation. He followed native custom and sent gifts of textiles and fowls to the native leaders, as a symbol of peace, accompanied by a spear as a promise of war should they refuse to submit. After a council, the Indian leaders accepted peace, and the region passed immediately under Spanish control. Cáceres released all his prisoners to return to their villages, a move that surprised the natives, who had expected harsh punitive measures. The fall of Lempira's stronghold was followed by the speedy capitulation of a wide area of Honduras, and came at a critical juncture for the Spanish, when they had been at the point of losing the province.|$|E

25|$|Because Montgomery did not state his aims in the action, it is {{difficult}} to evaluate the magnitude of the Rebel victory. While disabling two gunboats <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> accomplishment, neither was lost for long. Within a few weeks, both had been raised, repaired, and restored to service. At best, therefore, the fleet had delayed the Federal timetable by a short time.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March Columbine {{was in the}} Demerara River when Muddle awarded W. Hill, {{master of}} the ship Liverpool a letter of {{approbation}} and a pendant to fly from her mast. Liverpool had repulsed an attack by the notorious, and usually more successful, American privateer Snap Dragon in a five-hour action. The pendant <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to all British warships to respect Liverpools crew, i.e., not to press them.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{included a}} consistent land tax, {{which would include}} taxation of the nobility and clergy. Faced with opposition from the parlements, Calonne organised the summoning of the Assembly of Notables. But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne's proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism. In response, the King announced the calling of the Estates-General for May 1789, {{the first time the}} body had been summoned since 1614. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> that the Bourbon monarchy was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people.|$|E

25|$|By {{this point}} in his career, his {{professional}} reputation had already spread far afield. Dr. Theodore von Kármán, Chairman of the Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development (AGARD), nominated the young lieutenant colonel to represent the United States on its Flight Test Techniques Panel. This appointment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> honor. AGARD, a Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had been created to bring together the leading aeronautical experts from each of the member nations to find ways to use aviation research and development personnel and facilities for the common benefit of the member nations. Ridley served in this prestigious position from 1952 until 1956.|$|E
25|$|Pickle was {{the first}} ship to bring the news of Nelson's victory to Great Britain, {{arriving}} at Falmouth on 4 November 1805, after a hard voyage in bad weather. Vice Admiral Collingwood, who had assumed command {{after the death of}} Nelson, chose her to carry his dispatches describing the battle and announcing Nelson's death. Collingwood sent Pickle, captained by John Richards Lapenotière, back to Britain with the dispatches telling of the great victory. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> honour for any junior officer as it almost guaranteed promotion. After arriving in Falmouth, Lapenotière took a chaise to London to deliver the dispatches to the Admiralty, stopping 21 times to change horses. The Admiralty duly promoted him to Commander for this service, and the Committee of the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave him a sword worth 100 guineas and £500 in cash. The route that Lapenotière travelled is now known as The Trafalgar Way.|$|E
500|$|... "England {{expects that}} every man will do his duty" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> sent by Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, from his {{flagship}} [...] as the Battle of Trafalgar {{was about to}} commence on 21 October 1805. Trafalgar was a decisive naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars. It gave the United Kingdom control of the seas, removing all possibility of a French invasion and conquest of Britain. Although there was much confusion surrounding {{the wording of the}} signal {{in the aftermath of the}} battle, the significance of the victory and Nelson's death during the battle led to the phrase becoming embedded in the English psyche, and it has been regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced up to the modern day.|$|E

500|$|The women's march <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> {{event of}} the French Revolution, its impact on par {{with the fall of}} the Bastille. For its inheritors, the march would stand as an {{inspirational}} example, emblematic of the power of popular movements. The occupation of the deputies' benches in the Assembly created a template for the future, forecasting the mob rule that would frequently influence successive Parisian governments. But it was the crudely decisive invasion of the palace itself that was most momentous; the attack removed forever the aura of invincibility that once cloaked the monarchy. It marked the end of the king's resistance to the tide of reform, and he made no further open attempts to push back the Revolution. As one historian states, it was [...] "one of those defeats of royalty from which it never recovered".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{its being}} built on an embankment, {{lightweight}} building materials {{were used for}} the station: the platforms originally rested on timber supports for most of their length. Station buildings, including a goods shed and a combined ticket office and waiting room, were built on the eastbound platform in the 1860s. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> box on the eastbound platform by the 1880s which controlled a crossover between the two tracks; sidings at the west end of the station were controlled by a second signal box, and had a connection to the Nailsea Colliery. A footbridge, built by E. Finch and Co. of Chepstow, was erected in 1907; until then access between the two platforms was by a track-level crossing. This wooden footbridge was replaced by a metal one in the 1950s. The station was renamed [...] "Nailsea and Backwell" [...] on 1 May 1905.|$|E
500|$|The Carboniferous Limestone island {{rises to}} about [...] {{and serves as}} a wind and wave break, {{sheltering}} {{the upper reaches of the}} Bristol Channel. The island is now uninhabited, with the exception of the wardens. It is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with a large bird population and plants including wild peonies. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> station or watchtower on the island in Roman times, but there may have been human habitation as early as the Iron Age. In the 6th century it was home to St Gildas and to a small Augustinian priory in the 12th and 13th centuries. An inn was built in 1832 and used for holidays in the 19th century. A bird sanctuary was established in 1931 and since 1951 has been leased to charitable trusts. It is now owned by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{receiving}} the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed Joseph Brown Matthews (generally known as J. B. Matthews) as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un-American Activities Committee. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled [...] "Reds and Our Churches," [...] which opened with the sentence, [...] "The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen." [...] A group of senators denounced this [...] "shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy" [...] and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, {{and the majority of}} his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.|$|E
500|$|The second opera, Daphne, {{begins as}} {{the wedding of}} Florindo and Daphne gets under way. Cupid, bent on more mischief, wounds Daphne with a special arrow, forged by the god Vulcan, that causes her to renounce all love. She {{abandons}} the wedding and announces that she will join the goddess Diana and become a huntress. This sparks a series of schemes and counter-schemes as both Apollo and Florindo continue to pursue Daphne while the other would-be lovers manoeuvre for position. Lycoris assures Apollo that Daphne's abandonment of the wedding <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> that she favours him. Lycoris also steals Daphne's cloak and, wearing it as a disguise, makes advances to Damon, having first ensured that Florindo overhears. Florindo is enraged by what he believes is Daphne's duplicity, and denounces her. Damon confirms the story. Daphne, bewildered, pleads with her father Peneus to prove her innocence; he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree. Cupid blames Apollo's pride for the fiasco, but gives him the laurel as his [...] "special tree". Florindo now accepts Alfirena, and Lycoris, having confessed her scheming, is united with Damon. Only the guiltless Daphne ends up losing everything.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} before the First World War, Holst {{composed}} {{in a variety of}} genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> departure from what Short describes as [...] "the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with plainsong; the same year saw the enduringly popular St Paul's Suite (a [...] "gay but retrogressive" [...] piece according to Dickinson), and the failure of his large scale orchestral work Phantastes.|$|E
