5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E

25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting {{closer and closer to the}} optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.|$|E
