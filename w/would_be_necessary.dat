5|$|At {{particular}} issue was {{the ability of}} sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts argued that a more comprehensive compliance system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they would approve an increase in tuition which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to {{accomplish}} what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for the {{continued}} existence of the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to summon help. The only {{realistic}} way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition {{of many of his}} party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E

5000|$|The school {{announced}} it was closing in March 2013 {{due to lack of}} enrollment; only 42 students had pre-registered for the 2013-2014 school year. The school had calculated what <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> to save it as part of a feasibility study conducted in February 2013. 60 students <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> to keep the school open, and {{if that was the case}} the school would have operated at a deficit of $144,000 after the subsequent school year. 100 students <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> for complete financial viability. The school's finances were to have been drained by June 30, 2013 as it had $160,000 in reserve and the $38,000 originating from [...] "Save St. Joseph School". The school held its final graduation on May 10, 2013 with five students graduating. The following school year Ridgway Christian School began leasing the former St. Joseph building for its secondary students.|$|R

5|$|In 1950, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that the SAS-cooperation was weak, and that either a full merger or a discontinuation of the cooperation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> Braathen suggested to the government that DNL, Fred. Olsen Airtransport and Braathens SAFE should merge {{to create a new}} domestic airline, but this proposal was rejected by both DNL and Fred. Olsen. In 1949, the Swedish branch of SAS, Aerotransport (ABA), and the Danish branch, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) started a joint route to the Far East. For a merger to be completed, Danish and Swedish authorities required that SAS be granted all international routes from Norway, meaning that Braathens SAFE would lose its concession from 1 March 1954. The SAS merger was completed on 8 August 1951.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Congress {{directed}} Amtrak {{to study}} resumption of service, which rekindled hope of restoration. Amtrak published a feasibility study in October 2009, which proposed restoring the North Coast Hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule. Amtrak projected a yearly ridership of 359,800, {{some of whom}} would {{be drawn from the}} Empire Builder. Amtrak estimated that $1 billion in funds <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock. The corporation estimated it would take four to five years to reintroduce the service if a decision was made to move forward.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Virginia-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E

5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oslo {{announced}} in January 2004 that they, jointly with Lillehammer, planned {{to bid for}} the 2014 Winter Olympics. Deputy Mayor Svenn Kristiansen (Progress Party) speculated that normal hill ski jumping would be replaced with ski flying on the Olympic program and that it therefore <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to build a ski flying hill in Oslo. In November 2004, a Norwegian Ski Federation committee concluded that a new hill in Rødkleiva should be prioritized and that is would cost between NOK300 and 400 million. The following month Minister of Culture Valgerd Svarstad Haugland (Christian Democratic Party) criticized the federation for allowing Bertil Pålsrud and Steinar Johannesen to hold key roles in the decision process, while both owned a 13.3-percent stake in Rødkleiva Skiflyging.|$|E
