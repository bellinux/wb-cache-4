40|$|Abstract. An {{explosion}} {{yielding a}} blast wave can cause catastrophic {{damage to a}} building and its personnel. This threat defines an immediate importance for understanding blast mitigation techniques via readily available materials. An unconfined mass {{of water in the}} form of a free flowing sheet has been experimentally tested and analyzed as a readily available mitigant. A single <b>water</b> <b>sheet,</b> with an approximate sheet thickness of 3 mm, was experimentally tested with an explosively driven shock tube at three different standoff distances. At the strongest shock strength considered, the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> decreased the peak overpressure of the blast wave by 80 % and the impulse by 60 %. Additionally, the peak overpressure transmitted through the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> was roughly constant regardless of standoff distance and explosive strength...|$|E
40|$|The reflood {{test data}} from the rod bundle heat {{transfer}} (RBHT) test facility showed that the grids in the upper portion of the rod bundle could become wet well {{before the arrival of}} the quench front and that the sizes of liquid droplets downstream of a wet grid could not be predicted by the droplet breakup models for a dry grid. To investigate the water droplet generation from a wet grid spacer, a viscous linear temporal instability model of the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> issuing from the trailing edge of the grid with the surrounding steam up-flow is developed in this study. The Orr-Sommerfeld equations along with appropriate boundary conditions for the flow are solved using Chebyshev series expansions and the Tau-Galerkin projection method. The effects of several physical parameters on the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> oscillation are studied by determining the variation of the temporal growth rate with the wavenumber. It is found that a larger relative steam velocity to water velocity has a tendency to destabilize the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> with increased dynamic pressure. On the other hand, a larger ratio of steam boundary layer to the half <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness has a stabilizing effect on the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> oscillation. Droplet diameters downstream of the spacer grid predicted by the present model are found to compare reasonably well with the data obtained at the RBHT test facility as well as with other data recently reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{explosion}} {{yielding a}} blast wave can cause catastrophic damage {{to people and}} property. To mitigate damage from such an event, a number of investigators have proposed the use of water in various configurations. In this investigation, an unconfined free-flowing water-sheet, with an approximate thickness of 0. 3 cm, is experimentally examined using an explosively driven shock tube at three different standoff distances. The {{results show that the}} water-sheet mitigates the initial peak overpressure and impulse of the blast. Further insights into the underlying physics are revealed by a numerical simulation using Sandia's CTH hydrocode. In simulations and experiments, the air behind the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> experiences two distinct pressure peaks. An initial pressure rise results from the passage of a low pressure shock wave (M ≈ 1) through the intact sheet and into the air downstream of the <b>water</b> <b>sheet.</b> Following this, the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> breaks apart due to an increase in pressure on the forward surface caused by the buildup of the subsonic detonation products.

40|$|The {{continuously}} running {{liquid film}} tunnel (LFT) {{is a novel}} device suitable {{for the study of}} two-dimensional flows. In this innovation, the films start from a reservoir, run over a horizontal or non-horizontal wire frame and get pulled/washed by a <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> or by gravity of liquid film. How-ever, despite the simple design and widespread application of LFT, its working mechanisms are not well understood. In the present work, an experimental effort for explaining these mechanisms is reported. The results show that both film velocities and film flow rates increase with <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> velocity up to a saturation level. This behavior is described via a force balance between the shear force produced by the <b>water</b> <b>sheet</b> and the opposing pulling force of reservoir and boundary layer frictions. The results also show that the average film thickness depends on the surfactant concentration. This is as predicted by a model based on Langmuir’s adsorption theory, in which the liquid film contains two external monolayers of surfactant and a slab of surfactant solution in between. When a film is drawn from the reservoir to the <b>water</b> <b>sheet,</b> the surfactant molecules start migrating from the former to the latter. To restore the thermodynamic equilibrium, the dragged film pulls more surfactant due to Marangoni elasticity, and thus a flow is established. The film flow soon reaches an equilibrium rate as required by the force balance mentioned above...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{the main}} {{physical}} characteristics of plane <b>water</b> <b>sheets</b> flowing under gravity andsurrounded by free air are experimentally investigated. By varying the mean flow rate through a 0. 8 mm× 100 mm nozzle, <b>water</b> <b>sheets</b> are produced over {{a range of}} Reynolds and Weber numbers between 210 to 1240 and 0. 37 to 13. 52, respectively. First, {{the sensitivity of the}} sheets shapes to a mass flow ratevariation is evidenced. For a sufficiently high flow rate, a liquid sheet forms with two rims bordering it. These rims join after a certain length L c resulting in a triangle-like shape of the sheet. This characteristiclength is compared with a theoretical prediction given by a model valid for Re >> 1. Furthermore,some capillary waves forming a striped pattern are present at the sheet interface near the rims and arepropagating towards the central axis as the sheet falls. These waves are interpreted as the consequenceof the displacement of a high curvature gradient zone at the rim-sheet interface as suggested by theirstationary shape. The critical mass flow rate at which the sheet destabilization is systematically observedis Q c = 0. 056 kg. s − 1. It corresponds to a Weber number We ≈ 2. 7, a value in line with the theoreticalone We_th = O(1) which usually indicates a sufficient condition to maintain a stable sheet.

40|$|Subglacial {{drainage}} {{plays an}} important role in controlling coupling between glacial ice and underlying bed. Here, we study the flow of water in thin, macroporous sheets between ice and bed. Previous work shows that small perturbations in depth of a nearly parallel-sided water film grow unstably because these areas have enhanced viscous dissipation that leads to enhanced melting of an ice roof. We argue that in the presence of bed protrusions bridging a <b>water</b> <b>sheet,</b> downward motion of the ice roof can stabilize this sheet. Stability results when the rate of roof closure increases faster with water depth than the rate of viscous dissipation. We therefore modify existing theory to include protrusions that partially support the overlying glacier. Differences in the pressure on protrusions relative to water pressure drive roof closure. The mechanisms of both regelation and creep normal to the bed close the overlying ice roof and decrease the icebed gap. In order to account for multiple protrusion sizes along the bed (for instance, resulting from an assortment of various-sized sediment grains), we incorporate a method of partitioning overburden pressure among different protrusion size classes and the <b>water</b> <b>sheet.</b> Partitioning is dependent on the amount of ice protrusion contact and, therefore, water depth. This method allows prediction of roof closure rates. We then investigate stable, steady sheet configurations for reasonable parameter choices and find that these steady states can occur for modest water depths at very low effective pressures, as is appropriate for ice streams. Moreover, we find that multiple steady sheet thicknesses exist, raising the possibility of switches between low and high hydraulic conductivity regimes for the subglacial water system...|$|E
