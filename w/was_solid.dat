5|$|The President of the Italian Republic has an {{official}} standard. The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

5|$|During the 2007 season, Lee {{failed to}} reach {{the final of the}} Malaysia Open {{for the first time in}} five years. He also {{suffered}} an early exit in five competitions afterward. Later on that season he took the Indonesia Open crown, his first title since the 2006 Malaysia Open after reuniting with former coach Misbun Sidek from Li Mao. His performance at the second half of the year <b>was</b> <b>solid,</b> as he achieved three titles in the Philippines Open, the Japan Open, and the French Open. He also managed to reach the final of the China Open and Hong Kong Open, despite his knee injury haunting him on both occasions. Lee won all matches he played in the Sudirman Cup in June, despite Malaysia finishing just fifth in the tournament. Lee's low point of the year was in the World Championships, despite the tournament being held in front of his home crowd and his solid performance during the second half of the year, he was defeated in the third round by Indonesia's Sony Dwi Kuncoro. Lee criticised the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock for treating him indifferently and putting pressure on him before the world championships. While the chief of Badminton Association of Malaysia, Datuk Nadzmi Mohd Salleh encouraged Lee and the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock to improve their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Sisler <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> {{for much}} {{of the first half of}} the season, not {{allowing}} an earned run until May19, and by June5 he had an ERA of 0.74, a 1–0record with seven saves. It was at the point that his effectiveness declined rapidly, allowing runs to score in four of his next five appearances. In a game against the Red Sox on June18, he relieved starter Carl Mathias, and immediately gave up bases on balls to the first two batters he faced, which forced in two runs, then gave up a grand slam to Jim Pagliaroni. He followed with another base on balls, and was relieved without having recording an out. Over the course of the next couple months, with his ERA steadily rising, his playing time was lessened, making just six appearances in the month of July, and five in August. He made his last major league start on August31 against the Tigers, giving up seven hits and six earned runs for the loss. In 45total appearances in 1961, he had a 2–8win-loss record and finished sixth in AL with 11saves. On September16, the Senators agreed to send $75,000 ($ current dollar adjustment) and a player to be named later to the Cincinnati Reds of the NL for pitcher Claude Osteen. To complete the transaction, Washington sent Sisler to the Reds as that player named on November28.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with two four-game home series, against the Marlins and Braves. In their first {{game against the}} Marlins, a 4–0 loss, they had six hits. The next night the Phillies won, 7–4; Asche and Byrd had two RBIs each and the bullpen <b>was</b> <b>solid.</b> In the third game, Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; three runs scored in a 3–2 loss. The Phillies won the series' final game, 5–3, with a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley. After the game, Carlos Ruiz {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with to a concussion sustained in the 11th inning. After the Phillies swept the Braves earlier in the month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his old ways, allowing three runs in the first inning of a 4–2 loss. The next day, June 28, featured a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss. In the night game, the Phillies called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 5–1. After this game (the 81st of the 162-game season), the Phillies had a 36–45 record before losing the series' final game 3–2.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method to}} {{determine}} whether a coin was plated was listening to the sound produced by dropping the coin onto a hard surface since if the coin <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> silver it would have a distinctive ring. Although this was done by contemporary merchants, it is not recommended that this method be used on ancient coin since the coin could be damaged, especially since over time silver coins can become brittle, if the silver begins to recrystallize.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Neafie & Levy built {{some small}} {{warships}} and sugar-processing equipment for South American customers, a niche {{the company had}} filled since the 1870s.

To help pay for this expansion, the company went public, and formally became the Neafie & Levy Ship and Engine Building Company.

The exterior {{wall of the}} home <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> and massive, oak posts being preferred. Clay for the daub was dug from pits near the house, which were then used for storage.

25|$|However, the {{promises}} of fertile land in this new northern tract of wilderness proved false. Beneath thin layers of sparsely spread soil <b>was</b> <b>solid</b> granite.

During the first half of the 1900s, many of these colonization roads were incorporated into the growing provincial highway network. Some sections were improved to modern highway standards, while others were subsequently bypassed or abandoned. The roads that were not incorporated as highways either became local roads or were consumed by nature.|$|E
