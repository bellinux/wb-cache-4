Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E
