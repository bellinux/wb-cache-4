5000|$|Contradiction: [...] "This {{statement}} is false"; the statement cannot be false and true {{at the same}} time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie <b>wishes</b> that <b>wishes</b> couldn't come true. This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his <b>wish,</b> he did not grant his <b>wish,</b> and if he refuses to grant his <b>wish,</b> then he did indeed grant his <b>wish,</b> therefore {{making it impossible to}} either grant or not grant his <b>wish</b> because his <b>wish</b> contradicts itself.|$|R

5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress.

Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another <b>wished</b> to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who <b>wished</b> to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E

5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College.

Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E
