The important among them being the addition of three more bolts on the rear side of the port wing to strengthen, the wing attachments.

A revised finite element analysis of the wing establishes that in general the stress levels are low over {{a large portion of the}} wing. The stress values in the <b>wing</b> <b>bolts</b> show that the bolts have adequate factor of safety.

The transport ended its career as a non-flying film prop, appearing in ground roles (in the 1942 Flying Tigers, starring John Wayne, and in other features) before reportedly being scrapped around 1950, after having slowly become a back lot relic.

5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1972 six Merlin IVs {{had been}} built and {{production}} gradually built up alongside the concurrently produced short-fuselage Merlin III. In 1974, the original Merlin IV and Metro models were replaced by the SA226-AT Merlin IVA and the SA226-TC Metro II after about 30 Merlin IVs and about 20 Metros had been built. Among the changes made were larger, ovalised rectangular windows replacing the circular porthole-style windows of the early aircraft, and optional provision for a small Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) rocket in the tail cone, this being offered to improve takeoff performance out of [...] "hot & high" [...] airfields. The same year the Merlin III {{was replaced by the}} SA226-T Merlin IIIA, with an extra window {{on the right side of}} the cabin and a small window aft of the airstair on each side of the fuselage. Customers for the Merlin IIIA included the Argentinian Air Force, the Argentine Army and the Belgian Air Force.In January 1979 production of the Merlin IIIA ended in favour of the SA226-T(B) Merlin IIIB. The IIIB differed mainly by TPE331-10U engines of increased power driving four-bladed propellers turning in the opposite direction to those of earlier models. The SA227-TT Merlin IIIC was next, introduced concurrently with the SA227-AC Metro III (the first Metro III was Fairchild c/n AC-420 and the first Merlin IIIC was c/n TT-421, Metro and Merlin aircraft at this stage being numbered consecutively with different prefixes to denote the different types), and the SA227-AT Merlin IVC version of the Metro III followed shortly after (the first Merlin IVC was c/n AT-423). The Merlin IIIC was a redesign to incorporate structural and other changes but was visually the same as the Merlin IIIB, the redesign taking place to make the aircraft compliant with Special Federal Aviation Regulation 41 (SFAR-41). The Merlin IVC version was initially certified in 1980 at up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) this increasing to 14,500 pounds (6,577 kg) as engines and structures were upgraded. An option to go as high as 16,000 pounds (7,257 kg) was offered. Other improvements incorporated into the Merlin IVC were a 10 ft (3.05 m) increase in wing span (achieved by the simple expedient of removing the wingtips from the Metro II <b>wing,</b> <b>bolting</b> an extension to the end of each wing, and fitting a new wingtip, redesigned to reduce drag), TPE331-11U engines with redesigned [...] "quick-access" [...] engine cowlings and driving four-bladed propellers as on the Merlin IIIB, and other drag-reducing airframe modifications including landing gear doors that close after the gear is extended. The US Army bought a second-hand Merlin IVC and operated it as the solitary UC-26C.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer <b>wing</b> panels <b>bolt</b> to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a [...]040, 2024-t3 spar web. The spar cap angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the development of}} meso-scale legged robots have enabled high performance over a variety of terrains. However, there are still many environments where terrestrial legged robots are limited. The addition of aerodynamic capabilities provides a method of further extending the performance of small mobile robots towards all-terrain mobility. This dissertation presents the development of DASH+Wings and BOLT, two small hybrid legged and winged robots. DASH+Wings is a six-legged, two-winged robot capable of wing-assisted terrestrial running and controlled aerial descent. BOLT is a two-legged, four-winged robot capable of high-speed terrestrial running and sustained flight. While the dynamics of legged locomotion have been extensively studied, the interaction between legs and flapping wings during terrestrial locomotion is poorly understood. WingSLIP, an extension to the canonical SLIP model for understanding wing-assisted terrestrial locomotion, is introduced. Analysis of the leg/wing phasing and leg stiffnesses elucidates the interaction between the legs and wings. The model suggests the presence of passively stable gaits for high-speed wing-assisted terrestrial running. The dynamics of wing-assisted terrestrial locomotion for a quasi-static and dynamic gait are examined using BOLT with the addition of an on-board accelerometer and rate gyroscope. The flapping <b>wings</b> enable <b>BOLT</b> to run at over two ms - 1 and take off in as little as one meter of space. In addition to flapping wings, the passive effects of aerodynamics on a high-speed legged robot (VelociRoACH) are also examined. Passive aerodynamic stabilization is shown to improve the performance and stability of the system. An examination of avian flight evolution is performed using DASH+Wings to examine the consequences of adding wings to a cursorial locomotor. We note that current support for the diverse theories of avian flight origins derive from limited fossil evidence, the adult behavior of extant flying birds, and developmental stages of already volant taxa. The addition of flapping wings increased the maximum horizontal running speed and the maximum terrestrial incline angle of ascent, along with decreasing the aerial descent angle. To better examine avian flight evolution, a scaled model of Archaeopteryx is developed, and the effects of flapping frequency and amplitude are examined through the use of wind tunnel measurements. The findings are discussed in the context of existing hypotheses for the origins of flapping flight in vertebrates...|$|R
