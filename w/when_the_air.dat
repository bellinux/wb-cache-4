5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is cool. Later in the day, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> temperature may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation {{but nothing was}} done until 1926, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Commerce Act created the Bureau of Aeronautics within Hoover's Commerce Department.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne carried three Fleet Air Arm squadrons. Initially, she had up to 22 {{planes and}} 2 {{helicopters}} embarked at any time. The number of aircraft gradually increased until 1972, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> group peaked at 27 aircraft. Approximately 350 Fleet Air Arm personnel were stationed aboard the carrier.|$|E

5|$|Original Base Realignment and Closure {{commission}} plans only {{hinted at}} a Distributed Common Ground System being created at Otis.

5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind {{as much as}} several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E

5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, No. 43 Squadron {{was formed}} {{under the command}} of Major Sholto Douglas. Aircraft {{equipping}} the squadron included the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, built by the Fairey Aviation company, then in Hayes. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with Harry Hawker at the controls. Fairey conducted test flights at Northolt from 1917 until 1928 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry gave the company notice to vacate the aerodrome. Flights later resumed from the Great West Aerodrome owned by Fairey in Harmondsworth, which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport. No.43 Squadron went on to fly sorties over France from 17 January 1917, taking part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge between 4 and 8 April 1917.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|Phantom II {{production}} {{ended in}} the United States in 1979 after 5,195 had been built (5,057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi). Of these, 2,874 went to the USAF, 1,264 to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the rest to foreign customers. The last U.S.-built F-4 went to South Korea, while the last F-4 built was an F-4EJ built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan and delivered on 20 May 1981. As of 2008, 631 Phantoms were in service worldwide, while the Phantoms were in use as a target drone (specifically QF-4Cs) operated by the U.S. military until December 21, 2016, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force officially ended use of the type.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

5|$|The area {{commands}} {{and their}} responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands {{to begin with}} in 1940–41: Southern Area, Central Area, Western Area, and Northern Area. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force formed two groups that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central Area itself was disbanded {{and most of its}} units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed No.2 (Training) Group. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War; Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, Northern Command, was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E
