25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> possible.|$|E

The {{programs}} that were developed during this time were, to most people, simply [...] "astonishing": computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> that such [...] "intelligent" [...] behavior by machines was possible at all. Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.|$|E

500|$|English actor Chris Coxon {{played the}} role of SpongeBob. Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I {{can do a lot of}} the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Real Man" [...] {{also looks}} at {{the story of the}} Star of Bethlehem, which Bowen states would have been an [...] "astrological" [...] rather than [...] "astronomical" [...] phenomenon. According to {{astronomer}} Michael Molner, astrologers from around the time of Herod the Great <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> that the constellation Aries symbolised his kingdom and the lands that he controlled – during 6 BC, the year that some scholars theorise that Jesus was born, a rare planetary alignment meant that Jupiter, Saturn, the Sun and the Moon would have all appeared in this constellation. Bowen next looks at how Jesus would have been born out of wedlock: Mark Goodacre, a historian from the University of Birmingham, asserts that Jewish, pagan and Christian sources all confirm that Jesus was born out of wedlock, as do both the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. All four canonical gospels agree that the city of Nazareth was where Jesus grew up. Hanan Eshel, an archaeologist from Bar-Ilan University, proposes that Jesus's interest in religion and politics might have been sparked off during a family visit to the Temple Mount, the [...] "headquarters of the Jewish faith". The episode ends with Bowen spending the night alone at the Mount of Temptation just above Jericho, where Jesus is traditionally believed to have spent 40 days and nights being tempted by the devil.|$|E

According to Javier Castillo, {{secretary of the}} trade union that represents San José's miners, the company's management operates [...] "without listening {{to the voice of}} the workers when they say that there is danger or risk". [...] "Nobody listens to us. Then they say we're right.

2500|$|At 2106 Scheer {{requested}} a morning reconnaissance by Zeppelins of Horns Reef, strongly suggesting {{he intended to}} pass that way. [...] This information was not passed to Jellicoe, who instead at 2330 received only a composite summary of four messages decoded between 2155 and 2210, stating without explanation that the German fleet was returning home on course SSE3/4E at 16 knots. Although {{in this case the}} information was entirely correct it contradicted information received from [...] and [...] about contacts with the German fleet, {{which turned out to be}} misleading. Shorn of its details, the summary failed to convince: Jellicoe stated afterwards that had he received the specific information requesting air reconnaissance, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> the report.|$|E

If he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> them <b>believe</b> they are slaves, it is when they are sons, and have received the spirit of adoption, and the testimony, by that, of their sonship before.

2500|$|Stevens {{was among}} the first to {{recognize}} the potential of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening in the discovery of olefin polymerization catalysts. [...] Stevens’ work here led to an amazing hafnium-based catalyst family (few experts <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> a hafnium complex would have the needed activity) that enables the polymerization of propylene to isotactic polymers and copolymers in a high temperature solution process. [...] In a series of papers and patents starting in 2002, Stevens, along with colleagues and collaborators, disclosed new catalysts which are non-conventional, counter-intuitive, subtle, and have an unprecedented stereoselectivity along with remarkable high temperature performance. [...] This discovery has led to another family of new propene-based polyolefins and a process for the large-scale production of new thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. The resulting polymers have been commercialized under the VERSIFY tradename.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{permanently}} {{broke with}} Stanley Baldwin over Indian independence {{and did not}} again hold any office while Baldwin was Prime Minister. In the index to The Gathering Storm, Churchill's first volume of his history of World War II, he records Baldwin [...] "admitting to putting party before country" [...] for his alleged admission {{that he would not}} have won the 1935 Election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament. Churchill selectively quotes a speech in the Commons by Baldwin and gives the false impression that Baldwin is speaking of the general election when he was speaking of a by-election in 1933, and omits altogether Baldwin's actual comments about the 1935 election: [...] "we got from the country, a mandate for doing a thing [...] that no one, twelve months before, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> possible." [...] This canard had been first put forward in the first edition of Guilty Men but in subsequent editions (including those before Churchill wrote The Gathering Storm) had been corrected.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill firmly {{believed}} that Baldwin's conciliatory stance toward Hitler gave the German dictator {{the impression that}} Britain would not fight if attacked. Though known for his magnanimity toward political rivals such as Chamberlain, Churchill had none to spare for Baldwin. [...] "I wish Stanley Baldwin no ill," [...] Churchill said when declining to send him 80th birthday greetings in 1947, [...] "but {{it would have been}} much better had he never lived." [...] Churchill also {{believed that}} Baldwin, rather than Chamberlain, would be most blamed by subsequent generations for the policies that led to [...] "the most unnecessary war in history". [...] An index entry in the first volume of Churchill's [...] "History of the Second World War" [...] (The Gathering Storm) records Baldwin [...] "admitting to putting party before country" [...] for his alleged admission that he would not have won the 1935 election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament.

2500|$|The present {{church is}} also {{rectangular}} in shape. It is roughly oriented in [...] E - W direction, and has three naves divided by columns and preceded by an esonarthex. By the Northwest corner rises a metallic bell tower. The interior is richly adorned. On {{the right side}} near {{the middle of the}} nave there is a Pulpit, while at the end lies a rich iconostasis. Right of the iconostasis there is an icon which the tradition says painted by Saint Luke. The source lies in a subterranean crypt outside the church, and can be accessed descending a stair parallel the long sides of the church. A symmetric stair leads from the crypt to the church’s yard. The crypt is adorned with paintings and icons, and is surmounted by a dome painted with Christ in a starry sky. The water flows into a marble basin, where fishes are swimming. These fishes, present in the basin since centuries, gave origin to the Turkish name of the complex (balikli in Turkish means [...] "place where there are fishes"). According to a late legend, the day of the Conquest of Constantinople a monk was frying fishes in a pan near the source. When a colleague announced him the fall of the City, he replied that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> him only if the fishes in the pan would have come back to life. After his words these jumped in the source and began swimming.|$|E
