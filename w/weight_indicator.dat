40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} hierarchical aggregation approach using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for indicators. The core {{logic of the}} proposed approach is to reflect the hierarchical structures of indicators and their relative priorities in constructing composite indicators (CIs), simultaneously. Under hierarchical structures, the indicators of similar characteristics can be grouped into sub-categories and further into categories. According to this approach, we define a domain of composite losses, i. e., a reduction in CI values, based on two sets of weights. The first set represents the <b>weights</b> of <b>indicators</b> for each Decision Making Unit (DMU) with the minimal composite loss, and the second set represents the <b>weights</b> of <b>indicators</b> bounded by AHP with the maximal composite loss. Using a parametric distance model, we explore various ranking positions for DMUs while the <b>indicator</b> <b>weights</b> obtained from a three-level DEA-based CI model shift towards the corresponding weights bounded by AHP.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current article is to {{introduce}} a framework of the complexity of childhood obesity based on the family environment. A conceptual model that quantifies the relationships and interactions among parental socioeconomic status, family food security level, child’s food intake and certain aspects of parental feeding behaviour is presented using the structural equation modeling (SEM) concept. Structural models are analysed in terms of the direct and indirect connections among latent and measurement variables that lead to the child <b>weight</b> <b>indicator.</b> To illustrate the accuracy, fit, reliability and validity of the introduced framework, real data collected from 630 families from Urumqi (Xinjiang, China) were considered. The framework includes two categories of data comprising the normal body mass index (BMI) range and obesity data. The comparison analysis between two models provides some evidence that in obesity modeling, obesity data must be extracted from the dataset and analysis must be done separately from the normal BMI range.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring fetal shocks {{has focused}} on the effects of exogenous, but rather rare and violent events (e. g., military conflicts, natural disasters, terrorist attacks) and found that in utero experience has scaring, life lasting consequences. In this paper we consider the effect of an arguably more common and milder shock generated by a major and unexpected, albeit temporary, wage cut policy that affected all public sector employees in Romania in 2010. Our main findings suggest an overall improvement in the health at birth (as measured by the low birth <b>weight</b> <b>indicator)</b> of the cohorts exposed to the shock. Moreover, we find significant improvements in health at birth exclusively for boys and not for girls. This effect seems to be driven by significant effects of males exposed to the shock early in gestation. Additionally, we also find a decreased male to female ratio at birth for the cohort exposed to the shock. Overall, our results are consistent with the so-called culling theory hypothesizing that maternal exposure to significant stress early in gestation selects against male frail fetuses and, {{as a result of this}} selection in utero, at birth, one should observe significant improvements in health outcomes in the male cohorts...|$|E
40|$|Using {{conformal}} field theoretic methods we calculate correlation {{functions of}} geometric observables {{in the loop}} representation of the O(n) model at the critical point. We focus on correlation functions containing twist operators, combining these with anchored loops, boundaries with SLE processes and with double SLE processes. We focus further upon n= 0, representing self-avoiding loops, which corresponds to a logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) with c= 0. In this limit the twist operator {{plays the role of}} a zero <b>weight</b> <b>indicator</b> operator, which we verify by comparison with known examples. Using the additional conditions imposed by the twist operator null-states, we derive a new explicit result for the probabilities that an SLE_{ 8 / 3 } wind in various ways about two points in the upper half plane, e. g. that the SLE passes to the left of both points. The collection of c= 0 logarithmic CFT operators that we use deriving the winding probabilities is novel, highlighting a potential incompatibility caused by the presence of two distinct logarithmic partners to the stress tensor within the theory. We provide evidence that both partners do appear in the theory, one in the bulk and one on the boundary and that the incompatibility is resolved by restrictive bulk-boundary fusion rules.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{water resource}} vulnerability in the US {{portion of the}} Columbia River basin (CRB) using multiple indicators representing water supply, water demand, and water quality. Based on the US county scale, spatial analysis was conducted using various biophysical and socio-economic indicators that control water vulnerability. Water supply vulnerability and water demand vulnerability exhibited a similar spatial clustering of hotspots in areas where agricultural lands and variability of precipitation were high but dam storage capacity was low. The hotspots of water quality vulnerability were clustered around the main stem of the Columbia River where major population and agricultural centres are located. This multiple equal <b>weight</b> <b>indicator</b> approach confirmed that different drivers were associated with different vulnerability maps in the sub-basins of the CRB. Water quality variables {{are more important than}} water supply and water demand variables in the Willamette River basin, whereas water supply and demand variables are more important than water quality variables in the Upper Snake and Upper Columbia River basins. This result suggests that current water resources management and practices drive much of the vulnerability within the study area. The analysis suggests the need for increased coordination of water management across multiple levels of water governance to reduce water resource vulnerability in the CRB and a potentially different weighting scheme that explicitly takes into account the input of various water stakeholders...|$|E

Some of these diseases are considered to be of risk for hearing. Objective: Check and compare the occurrence of risk indicators of the Hearing Loss during the interval of 10 years in a maternity of São Paulo. Method: Quantitative and retrospective study carried out from the research and review of data of registers supplied by a maternity of the city of São Paulo. We surveyed the registers of babies who were born from January through December of the years of 1995 (n= 2. 077) and 2005 (n= 5. 129), including those who had risk indicators for deafness and prematurity, low weight and asphyxia, besides having a diagnosis confirmed or suspicion of infecto-contagious diseases of group TORSCH-A.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate associations of several indicators of mothers 2 ̆ 7, fathers 2 ̆ 7, and own socioeconomic status, and intergenerational social mobility, with body mass index (BMI) and weight change in young women. Methods This population-based cohort study used survey data provided by 8756 women in the young cohort (aged 18 - 23 years at baseline) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health. In 1996 and 2000, women completed mailed surveys in which they reported their height and weight, and their own, mother 2 ̆ 7 s, and father 2 ̆ 7 s education and occupation. Results Multiple linear regression models showed that both childhood and adulthood socioeconomic status were associated with women 2 ̆ 7 s BMI and weight change, generally in the hypothesized (inverse) direction, but the associations varied according to socioeconomic status and <b>weight</b> <b>indicator.</b> Social mobility was associated with BMI (based on father 2 ̆ 7 s socioeconomic status) and weight change (based on mother 2 ̆ 7 s socioeconomic status), but results were slightly less consistent. Conclusions Results suggest lasting effects of childhood socioeconomic status on young women 2 ̆ 7 s weight status, independent of adult socioeconomic status, although the effect may be attenuated among those who are upwardly socially mobile. While the mechanisms underlying these associations require further investigation, public health strategies aimed at preventing obesity may need to target families of low socioeconomic status early in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives...|$|E
