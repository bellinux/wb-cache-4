2500|$|They {{recall the}} session as being {{accompanied}} by heavy marijuana use. [...] "We used to smoke dope from {{when we got}} out of bed to <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears." [...] Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for [...]|$|E
2500|$|When he was 16, {{and still}} in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish {{children}} in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then {{became aware of the}} possibility of writing his own songs. [...] "And the next thing, I got a guitar <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," [...] he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the [...] "first real interest" [...] he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful [...] "frustrations".|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our quarters, {{which we}} did without accident, Curtis asked me jocularly what I was {{thinking}} about.|$|E
60|$|And so {{we talked}} and smoked and stuffed {{watermelons}} much as two hours, {{and then it}} was pretty late, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> the house was quiet and dark, and everybody gone to bed.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} corral {{the first thing}} that {{happened}} to me was a smack from mother for having stayed away so long; but father praised Jed and me <b>when</b> <b>we</b> gave our report.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] the men said, [...] "but {{we might}} be sunk by the guns, going there; and we should {{certainly}} be hung, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> if they found out where we had been." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, {{along came}} Rectus and Corny. They {{had been out}} walking together, and looked hot.|$|E
60|$|The {{adventures of}} the night were not exhausted, so far as I was concerned, even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our vessel.|$|E
6000|$|The {{sands of}} the hour had all run out <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Temeraire. Says Bullfinch, then, to the youth in livery, with boldness, 'Lavatory!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! He was a {{great deal}} too clever for that. He sent me out to meet Whitlett, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> he had shown us a clean pair of heels. He got away through the window." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "Oh, yes! Mrs. Miller never {{gives you}} {{anything}} but ice-cream; and I {{thought we should}} all need something hot <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> and so I had a few--But I forgot all about the supper!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{wondering}} talk, after she was gone; and the guards and servants passed the talk to the town, the town passed it to the country; Domremy was already buzzing with it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the chamber}} we found Hutcheson still {{opposite}} the Iron Virgin; {{he had been}} evidently philosophising, and now gave us the benefit of his thought {{in the shape of}} a sort of exordium.|$|E
60|$|But alas! the joy did not last. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} from a stroll around the cliffs, the same old routine of {{yesterday}} was resumed: gloom and anxiety, hope, high spirits, deep depression, and apathetic aloofness.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{our hotel}} after the baths that afternoon, the {{concierge}} greeted us with: 'Well, your noble nephew has arrived, high-well-born countess! He came with his boxes just now, {{and has taken}} a room near your honourable ladyship's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{sent that}} adrift. If we are traced up {{we want to}} shield {{ourselves}} by saying we went off hunting and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> could find nothing of him and the boat, and {{had to get a}} stranger to take us ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, {{were alone}} present. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from church, I {{went into the}} kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John {{cleaning}} the knives, and I said-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{house was}} silent <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> save for some poor {{creature}} who was screaming away {{in one of}} the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, King Arthur's Round Table {{was ready}} for us in its white drapery, and the head waiter and his first assistant, in swallow-tails and white cravats, brought in the soup and the hot plates at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are not," [...] {{the chief}} said. [...] "If you took {{all we have}} {{it would not be}} {{sufficient}} and, without our animals, we should starve <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hills; but I will pay twice the amount previously demanded." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} I wound {{and set the}} {{pedometer}} {{and put it in}} my pocket, for I was to carry it next day and keep record of the miles we made. The work which we had given the instrument to do during the day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly.|$|E
60|$|The {{king had}} hardly missed us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> at nightfall. He had early dropped again into {{his dream of}} a grand {{invasion}} of Gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear of that," [...] Dick said laughing. [...] "The countess {{said that}} some supper should be ready for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> I feel tremendously peckish. After the night air, and plenty of hot tea and a good tuck-in, we shall sleep without dreaming, I can venture to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way," [...] he insisted confidently. [...] "We couldn't be married in London. All the tribe of Harbord {{would come and}} boo, and it would save no end of gossip and bother <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> Anne--I love you very much and I want you {{just as soon as}} I can get you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{hungry and}} thirsty and tired I was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp! The {{day had been}} {{singularly}} rich in exciting thrills and sensorial perceptions. I called to the Jap: [...] "I'm starv-ved to death!" [...] And Takahashi, who had many times heard my little boy Loren yell that, grinned all over his dusky face. [...] "Aw, lots good things pretty soon!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the cottage, I fell talking {{rather more}} freely {{with her father}} about the {{nationalization}} of railways, and my spirits and temper had so far mended at the realization that I could still produce an effect upon Nettie, that I was even playful with Puss. Mrs. Stuart judged from that that things were better with me than they were, and began to beam mightily.|$|E
60|$|And {{that put}} Harris {{in mind of}} a friend of his, {{who had been in the}} Volunteers, and who had slept out under canvas one wet night down at Aldershot, “on just such another night as this,” said Harris; and he had woke up in the morning a cripple for life. Harris said he would {{introduce}} us both to the man <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town; it would make our hearts bleed to see him.|$|E
50|$|Asked if I {{would do}} it all again, I used to give an unequivocal reply that of course I would. But now I don't know if I would. I'm a very old man now {{and one of the}} things I {{experienced}} was that those of us who survived Spain experienced different sorts of treatment <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
5000|$|We {{realised}} we {{were working}} under false pretences, the thing had gone quickly beyond where The Yardbirds had left off. We all agreed {{there was no point}} in retaining the New Yardbirds tag so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from Scandinavia <b>we</b> decided to change the name the band. It was a fresh beginning for us all.|$|R
60|$|How we {{longed for}} the light and heat of a blazing fire <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back!</b> But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was {{immediately}} surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.|$|R
60|$|It {{was full}} summer <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Wisconsin, and The Old Homestead {{was at its}} best. The garden was red with {{ripening}} fruit, the trees thick with shining leaves, and the thrushes and catbirds were singing in quiet joy. In the fields the growing corn was showing its ordered spears, and the wheat was beginning to wave in the gentle wind. No land could be more hospitable, more abounding or more peaceful than our valley.|$|E
60|$|I staid {{about an}} hour, {{receiving}} every mark of kindness from these excellent and respectable people, leaving {{them to believe}} we were to sail in the morning. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the transport no one knew of our absence, and nothing was ever said of our taking the boat. The Regulus did not sail for twenty hours after this, but I had no more communication with the shore. We got to sea, at last, two transports, under the convoy of the Pictou.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wudden' goo for to zay that, zurr--'tis an ugly word. Da-am!" [...] he added, {{staring at}} his boots, [...] "'twas thru me tu. We were along among the haythen, and I mus' nades goo for to break me leg. The capt'n he wudden' lave me. 'One Devon man,' he says to me, 'don' lave anotherr.'

5000|$|....'What the fuck's {{happening}}? When's {{the album}} coming out? When are you gonna get us some gigs? What's happening about getting us an agency?' All we'd get was bullshit about the sleeve, you know, photographs and all that. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from Rockfield with the masters, of course, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the big: 'Oh, great, fantastic', {{but in the}} ensuing weeks it was just excuses and bullshit..|$|R
500|$|According to Paste magazine, Ocasek {{said that}} he was [...] "amazed at how <b>we</b> clicked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> together." [...] Exclaim! has noted that The Cars' Facebook page {{featured}} a picture of producer Jacknife Lee, [...] "which suggests that he will be producing the new album." [...] According to Rolling Stone, Lee produced five of the songs from the album; The Cars themselves produced the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "This way, doctor; {{you have}} taken the wrong turning!" [...] cried Allan. [...] "I'm the dreamer, not he. Don't look astonished; it wasn't in this {{comfortable}} house; it was on board that confounded timber-ship. The fact is, I fell asleep just before you took us off the wreck; and it's not to be denied that I had a very ugly dream. Well, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> here--" ...|$|R
