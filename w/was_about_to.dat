5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships.

None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed.

The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> begin.|$|E
