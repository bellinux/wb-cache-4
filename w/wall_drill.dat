40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of rapid drilling in ice sheets and glaciers to depths of up to 600 m, with cuttings and cores continually transported by air reverse circulation. The method employs dual <b>wall</b> <b>drill</b> rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, coalescing filters, desiccant dryers) should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa. Drilling of a 600 -m deep hole can be accomplished within 1. 5 days in the case of 24 h drilling operations. However, to avoid sticking while drilling through ice, the drilling depth should to be limited to 540 m at a temperature of − 20 °C and to 418 m at a temperature of − 10 °C. この論文では、氷床や氷河の深度 600 mまでの氷コア掘削について、空気を循環して送ることで氷の切削と氷コアの輸送を連続的に行う高速掘削の実行可能性について述べている。この方法は、二重のチューブにしたドリルロッドを使うことで可能である。二重ドリルロッドの内側チューブは、ドリルの切削面から地上までの切削チップおよび氷コアの輸送経路となる。様々な氷河の状況によって空気循環掘削技術を適応するために、それに対応するドリルロッドのカッターと空気処理装置（乾燥した冷たい空気を送るための、空冷クーラー、空気貯留タンク、空気乾燥機など）を使用する必要がある。直径 60 mm、長さ 200 mmの氷コアを運ぶための空気速度は 22. 5 m/s以上でなければならず、連続的な切削チップおよび氷コア輸送のための最小空気流量は 2. 3 〜 2. 6 MPaの時に 6. 8 m 3 /分になる。 24 時間の掘削作業の場合には、 600 mの深さの孔を 1. 5 日以内に掘削することが可能である。しかし、氷河や氷床の掘削中にスタックするのを避けるためには、掘削深度を− 20 ℃の氷温では 540 mに、− 10 ℃の氷温では 418 mに制限する必要がある...|$|E
40|$|A {{close-coupled}} {{barrier is}} produced by first installing a conventional cement grout curtain followed by a thin inner lining of a polymer grout. The resultant barrier is a cement polymer composite that has economic benefits derived from the cement and performance benefits from the durable and resistant polymer layer. Close-coupled barrier technology is applicable for final, interim, or emergency containment of subsurface waste forms. Consequently, when considering the diversity of technology application, the construction emplacement and material technology maturity, general site operational requirements, and regulatory compliance incentives, the close-coupled barrier system provides an alternative for any hazardous or mixed waste remediation plan. This paper discusses the installation of a close-coupled barrier and the subsequent integrity verification. The demonstration was installed at a benign site at the Hanford Geotechnical Test Facility, 400 Area, Hanford, Washington. The composite barrier was emplaced beneath a 7, 500 liter tank. The tank was chosen to simulate a typical DOE Complex waste form. The stresses induced on the waste form were evaluated during barrier construction. The barrier was constructed using conventional jet grouting techniques. Drilling was completed at a 45 {degree} angle to the ground, forming a conical shaped barrier with the waste form inside the cone. Two overlapping rows of cylindrical cement columns were grouted in a honeycomb fashion to form the secondary backdrop barrier layer. The primary barrier, a high molecular weight polymer manufactured by 3 M Company, was then installed providing a relatively thin inner liner for the secondary barrier. The primary barrier was emplaced by panel jet grouting with a dual <b>wall</b> <b>drill</b> stem, two phase jet grouting system...|$|E

40|$|The {{duration}} of drilling attacks on bivalve prey by muricid gastropods {{is largely a}} function of shell thickness at the drilling site selected by the predator. Attacks initiated at the thin valve edges (edge dril-ling) take significantly less time than drilling through the thicker shell <b>wall</b> (<b>wall</b> <b>drilling).</b> Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the muricid Chicoreus dilectus (Adams, 1885) employs the edge-drilling mode of attack nearly three times more often than <b>wall</b> <b>drilling</b> when exposed to chemical cues from the shell-crushing stone crabMenippe mercenaria, one of its natural enemies, than when foraging in isolation. Chicoreus dilectus is also known to edge drill more frequently {{in the presence of}} conspecific snails, which represent competitors for food as well as potential cannibals. Together, these findings suggest that edge drilling by C. dilectus should be considered as a general behavioural response to enemies instead of a specialized response to conspecific enemies. Although all snails exposed to stone crabs expressed the edge-drilling behaviour at least once, <b>wall</b> <b>drilling</b> was still more commonly used by each of these snails, suggesting that there are constraints on behavioural plasticity in the expression of edge drilling...|$|R

40|$|Edge {{drilling}} is {{a strategy}} used by some gastropod predators when feeding on bivalve or brachiopod prey in which the bore-hole is positioned at the valve margin. This strategy can poten-tially reduce drilling times {{by a factor of}} two to three as compared with <b>wall</b> <b>drilling</b> (i. e. drilling near the thicker centre of the valve), the typical default drilling behaviour (Dietl & Herbert, 2005). Dietl, Herbert & Vermeij (2004) showed that, at least for muricid predators, edge drilling is expressed more fre-quently when drillers are exposed to intense competition risk. They speculated that the reduction in drilling time achieved by edge-drilling snails may be advantageous, allowing a predator to achieve either a higher net energy gain per unit time or reduced exposure to their own predators. There are few reports of edge-drilling behaviour by species of the gastropod family Naticidae, however, and the extent of its use across the family has never been investigated systematically, either in field studies or in experimental settings. A review of the literature on drilling studies indicates that gas-tropods of the family Naticidae employ multiple modes of preda-tion when attacking bivalve prey (Table 1; Vermeij, 1980; Ansell & Morton, 1985, 1987). Drilling is most prevalent, but other methods include feeding through the open gape of bivalves that cannot tightly shut their valves (Edwards, 1974) or suffocat-ing prey by enveloping them within the foot (Vermeij, 1980; Hutchings & Herbert, 2013; Visaggi, Dietl & Kelley, 2013). <b>Wall</b> <b>drills</b> are {{the most common type of}} drilling employed, par-ticularly by naticid species outside the tropics (Kitchell et al., 1986; Ansell & Morton, 1987). <b>Wall</b> <b>drills</b> are typically placed near the umbonal region of the shell (Kelley & Hansen, 200...|$|R

40|$|Drilling fluid`s {{contact with}} the {{productive}} zone of horizontal or complex wells can reduce well productivity by fluid invasion in the borehole <b>wall.</b> Salted <b>drilling</b> drill-in fluid containing polymers has often been applied in horizontal or complex petroleum wells in the poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs of the Campos basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This fluid usually consists of natural polymers such as starch and xanthan gum, which are deposited as a filter cake on the wellbore <b>wall</b> during the <b>drilling.</b> Therefore, the identification of a lift-off mechanism failure, which can be detachment or blistering and pinholing, will enable formulation improvements. increasing the chances of success during filter cake removal in open hole operations. Likewise, knowledge of drill-in drilling fluid adsorption/desorption onto sand can help understand the filter cake-rock adhesion mechanism and consequently filter cake lift-off mechanism failures. The present study aimed to identify the lift-off failure mechanism {{for this type of}} fluid filter cake studying adsorption/desorption onto SiO(2) using solutions of natural polymers, lubricants, besides the fluid itself. Ellipsometry was employed to measure this process. The adsorption/desorption studies showed that the adsorbed layer of drilling fluid onto the walls of the rock pores is made up of clusters of polymers, linked by hydrogen bonds, which results in a force of lower cohesion compared to the electrostatic interaction between silica and polymers. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} most probable filter cake failure mechanism is rupture (blistering and pinholing), which results in the formation of ducts within the filter cake.
