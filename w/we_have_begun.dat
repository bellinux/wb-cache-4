60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> {{the fight}} of Pieters Nek which ended before midday with the {{surrender}} of Simon Botha and over seven hundred men. It was the crown of all my soldiering.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I was not. It {{must have}} been {{internal}} grumbling by yourself that you heard," [...] I retorted, sauntering back to the fire, which by that time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> to light daily.|$|R

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> at {{the dinner}} table with itineraries and the usual {{topographical}} talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel. [...] "My husband doesn't walk," [...] she said. [...] "His heart is weak and he cannot manage the hills." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{remarked that}} the secrecy with which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>had</b> been marred by the newspapers; not only all our facts but all our plans and {{purposes}} had been revealed; even all the suspected persons had been named; these would doubtless disguise themselves now, or go into hiding.|$|R

60|$|We stood silent. The {{exceptional}} lot of Barbel's super-pointed pins {{seemed to}} pierce our very souls.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> this Sunday to {{read the}} book of Genesis.

To begin with, Daly, whom you told us you meant to mislead, was here again yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|Except {{for this}} {{explosion}} {{the interview was}} very successfully conducted. No doubt Mr. Carlyle would talk, as lawyers do, little by little. We could thus feel <b>we</b> <b>had</b> laid the foundations of a better feeling in the country, and the man's own misconduct would certainly complete what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun.</b> Indeed, before his departure, the lawyer showed us there had already gone abroad some glimmerings of the truth.|$|R
