2500|$|The large {{petroleum}} reserves {{under the}} North Sea have been exploited since 1965. The Treasure Finder semi-submersible accommodation platform supported {{a number of}} offshore oil rigs and normally carried a group of four Bell 212 support helicopters for inter-rig transfers of passengers and freight and medical evacuation. Treasure Finder was also the location of hospital facilities servicing the Brent oilfield. On 14 September 1982, a crewman on the Baffin Seal seismic survey vessel suffered an injury and the captain placed a request for medical assistance to the Treasure Finder. [...] The Baffin Seals helicopter deck was obstructed so the rescue helicopter {{would not be able}} to land on the vessel but instead would have to winch the casualty aboard. [...] To accomplish this, the helicopter took off with a full crew of pilot, co-pilot, winch operator, <b>winchman,</b> doctor and medic.|$|E

50|$|This episode {{focused on}} the life of a <b>winchman</b> aboard an RAF Sea King.|$|E
50|$|The line is {{controlled}} {{by a pair of}} <b>winchmen,</b> one per section and located in the Halfway power house, who control the speed and direction of rotation of the cable, and hence the cars attached to the cable. They are assisted by attendants on each car, who are in communication with the <b>winchmen</b> using an induction-loop radio system. Prior to the introduction of this radio system, messages were passed using an overhead wire telegraph and trolley poles on the tram cars. The overhead wire has since been removed, but the cars still carry the trolley poles.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} {{the point at which}} {{passengers}} change cars, the Halfway stop is also the control centre for the Great Orme Tramway. The electric motors which drive the cables that propel the cars are located in the central building of the stop, as are the <b>winchmen</b> who control them.|$|R
50|$|The Search and Rescue Training Unit (SARTU) of the Royal Air Force {{is located}} on the {{southern}} side of RAF Valley on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales. SARTU operates three AgustaWestland AW139 and other Bell Griffin HT.1 helicopters to train pilots and <b>winchmen</b> before progression to active Search and Rescue duties. With FB Heliservices (part of Cobham plc) contracted to provide the aircraft, engineers and flight line for the Unit it is often that one of the HT.1 helicopters be replaced with a HAR.2. This is a fully SAR capable aircraft that 84 Squadron uses in Cyprus on SAR duties.|$|R

50|$|The crew who {{operated}} the dredge consisted of various positions. The dredge master {{was responsible for}} ensuring the productivity of the dredge, and would also serve as winter watchman. Among the position's activities were documenting crew hours and breakdowns, and preparing a dredging plan for the area to be excavated. The <b>winchman</b> {{operated the}} dredge from the master control room, taking over for the dredge master on the evening and night shifts. Among the winchman's tasks were supervising the crew and operating the digging ladder. An oiler lubricated and maintained all moving parts, including pumps, motors, tumblers, and the main drive, and replaced worn parts, also substituting for the <b>winchman</b> at times.|$|E
50|$|As well {{as being}} {{the point at which}} {{passengers}} change cars, the Halfway stop is also the control centre for the line. The electric motors which drive the cables that propel the cars are located in the central building of the stop, as are the <b>winchmen</b> who control them. This in turn leads to a further difference between the two sections. With the drive {{at the top of the}} lower section, there are only two haulage cables, from the Halfway stop to each car. As the upper section has its drive at the bottom of the section, a third cable is needed that connects the two cars via a sheave at the Summit stop.|$|R
50|$|The {{team are}} {{called out to}} {{transport}} a three-month premature baby, Sam Harcus, from Orkney {{to a hospital in}} Aberdeen. During the flight, Baby Sam's heart stopped and the helicopter <b>winchman,</b> Bob Pountney, kept the baby alive by providing heart massage during the flight.|$|E

5000|$|... 1979 - A Silver Medal {{was awarded}} to Coxswain Trevor England when the {{lifeboat}} stood by the Greek freighter Skopelos Sky in difficulty off Trevose Head in a westerly hurricane and phenomenal seas on 15 December. Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum were awarded to the crew and slipway helpers who were at times up to their necks in the sea getting the lifeboat back on her slipway. The <b>winchman</b> was presented with a Vellum Service Certificate.|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was initially}} equipped with Westland Whirlwind HAR.2s until August 1962, these were later {{replaced by the}} Whirlwind HAR.10s from August 1962.The squadron was based at RAF Thorney Island, the early Whirlwind suffered from low power which seriously reduced its lift capability during hot weather. One of its successes was the rescue of a family from a yacht that {{was caught in a}} severe storm in or around Portsmouth harbour. The three were rescued one at a time and the <b>winchman,</b> a mechanic, was obliged to wait on deck until all were lifted off. The yacht broke up shortly after he was removed.|$|E
5000|$|He made it as {{far north}} as Shetland calling in at Baltasound in Unst to get supplies. He was next spotted {{rounding}} Muckle Flugga lighthouse heading out into the Atlantic. Soon after, his vessel capsized in 20 ft-high seas 50 mi west of the islands in August 2001. [...] "He was asleep in his bunk" [...] when his boat overturned but managed to contact rescuers with via a satellite phone and spent around an hour in the sea clinging to the upturned vessel. Kieran Murray, helicopter <b>winchman</b> on Coastguard rescue helicopter Oscar Charlie based in Shetland said Hill was [...] "extremely lucky" [...] to survive.|$|E
5000|$|The first Bell 212 Twin-Huey Search {{and rescue}} {{helicopter}} from the squadron (call sign Rescue One Zero) was piloted by Lieutenant Kao Yit Chee, fitted with floodlights, approached the first stranded cabin {{and despite the}} strong winds and danger, the winch operator - 2WO Ramasamy Veerappan winched down the <b>winchman</b> - Lance Corporal Phua Kim Hai. He was blown off on the first attempt but on the second attempt, he reached {{the door of the}} cabin, unlocked it and went inside. He came out with the first passenger strapped to his body by a harness. The winch operator pulled both of them to safety.|$|E
50|$|The riskiest rescues were {{undertaken}} by a Royal Australian Navy Lieutenant Geoff Ledger (now a Commodore), {{who was on}} loan to RSAF to help train helicopter pilots. Despite the windy condition encountered above the harbour and the strong downwash of the rescue helicopter's main rotors, he managed to pilot the second Bell 212 rescue helicopter (call sign Rescue One One) close above the cars to allow <b>winchman</b> Lance Corporal Selvanathan Selvarajoo (now a Senior Warrant Officer (SWO) in RSAF's 125 Squadron) to enter two cabins hanging only by their towline. Overall, the entire rescue mission took {{three and a half}} hours of risky hovering in pitch black darkness and high wind conditions to accomplish.|$|E
50|$|Fitzpatrick {{died after}} her {{search and rescue}} team's helicopter, Rescue 116, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while {{providing}} top cover for the Sligo-based search and rescue helicopter, Rescue 118, during a rescue mission off {{the west coast of}} County Mayo, Ireland. Fitzpatrick was found and later pronounced dead at Mayo University Hospital in Castlebar. The body belonging to one of the missing crew was found in the cockpit section of the aircraft on 24 March by Navy divers and it was retrieved on 26 March after which it was identified as that of co-pilot Captain Mark Duffy. The two remaining members of her crew; Winch Operator Paul Ormsby and <b>Winchman</b> Ciar√°n Smith are still missing. The search and rescue operation is still ongoing. Her funeral took place on 18 March and she was buried.|$|E
50|$|On 14 March 2017, at 12:45 am local time, a Sikorsky S-92A {{operated}} by CHC Helicopter {{under contract to}} the Irish Coast Guard (call sign Rescue 116, based at Dublin Airport) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while providing top-cover (communications relay) support for the Sligo-based search and rescue helicopter, Rescue 118, during a rescue mission off County Mayo on Ireland‚Ä≤s west coast. One of the crew members, Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, was recovered from the water within hours and later pronounced dead in hospital. The body {{of one of the}} missing crew was found in the wreckage on 24 March and recovered by NSDS divers on 26 March after which it was formally identified as that of Captain Mark Duffy. Two other members of the crew, Winch Operator Paul Ormsby and <b>Winchman</b> Ciar√°n Smith are still missing. The search and recovery operation is ongoing.|$|E
5000|$|The boom is {{connected}} with {{the lower part of}} the mast which is shaped like a [...] "Y" [...] or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between guys and derrick, the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. Looking at the illustration, one can easily see that the right outrigger stays in the centerline and the left outrigger has moved outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or hauled. Three winches, controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen Derrick; two for the guys and one for the purchase. To avoid an over-topping or over-swinging limit-switches are used. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load (SWL) of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-frame option, is a kind of traditional topping lift. The Hallen D-Frame is a steel bracket welded on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a [...] "D"-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the guys. The Hallen derrick has a good purpose for e.g. containers, logs, steel rail, sawn timber and heavy lifts and doesn't lend itself for small, general cargo. It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one <b>winchman</b> is needed and within a few minutes the Hallen is brought into use. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen Derrick, it is able to swing 75¬∞ from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15¬∞.|$|E
40|$|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists {{estimate}} that 10 - 23 % {{of pregnant women}} in the US face depression {{at some point during}} their pregnancy. However, no clear recommendations regarding the treatment of depression in pregnancy are available. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy without clear evidence of their safety. A study of 1, 106, 757 women in 47 states found that 89, 980 (8. 1 %) had taken an antidepressant at some point during their pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 298 (4. 5 %) of 6582 women in 10 states between the years of 1998 and 2005 had taken an antidepressant at some time during a pregnancy or up to three months before pregnancy. Of the women, 250 (3. 8 %) used a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) making them the most commonly used type of antidepressant in pregnancy. A major concern with SSRI use during pregnancy is the potential risk for congenital malformations, including congenital heart defects (CHD). Therefore, the study purpose is to determine if risk of CHD is {{associated with the use of}} SSRIs during pregnancy. After an extensive review of the biomedical literature and extraction of data from existing studies of CHD risk with SSRI using during pregnancy, a meta-analysis will be completed. Few meta-analyses examine the effects of the SSRI class on CHDs; existing meta-analyses focus on paroxetine. The goal of this meta-analysis is to pool data from studies meeting inclusion criteria to examine a possible connection between the use of SSRIs during pregnancy and CHD. An extensive data search was performed using three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases. From all searches, a total of 1, 417 results were found, including duplicates. Studies were narrowed based on topic relevance, medications studied, and study type. Eight studies were selected for further analysis based on several criteria. Studies included in the analysis were all population-based cohort studies with specific data including: number of women exposed and unexposed to SSRIs, and number of CHDs in both exposed and unexposed women. Studies were excluded if they included women exposed to antidepressants other than SSRIs. From the eight studies included in the analysis a total of 65, 710 women were exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy and 719 reports of CHD were reported. Of the 2, 960, 492 women who were not exposed to an SSRI during their pregnancy, 27, 405 CHD outcomes were reported. The studies included in the analysis show mixed results individually. Three of the studies found no association between SSRI use and CHD (Huybrechts et al, Margulis et al, <b>Winchman</b> et al). Five studies found an association between SSRI use and CHD (Berard et al, Kundsen et al, Jimenez-Solem et al, Malm et al, Pedersen et al). Even within the studies variation is found. For example, in Berard et al., cardiac malformations were not significant with SSRI use; however, when further analyzed by type of malformation, ventricular and atrial septal defects were associated with SSRI use. Based on the lack of knowledge about the effect of SSRIs on CHD, this meta-analysis will help to clarify this much-debated topic. The results will help women and their providers make an educated assessment regarding the potential risks from SSRI use during pregnancy and balance that knowledge with the risks of not treating depression during pregnancy...|$|E
