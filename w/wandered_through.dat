5|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, {{stopping}} in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi {{then went to}} the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
25|$|A small {{population}} of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians, <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> Southwestern United States {{after having been}} imported in the 19th century {{as part of the}} U.S. Camel Corps experiment. When the project ended, they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released. Twenty-five U.S. camels were bought and imported to Canada during the Cariboo Gold Rush.|$|E

25|$|Before 1987 the IDNR's {{records show}} {{no signs of}} river otter in the Kishwaukee River. The reason was that the Kishwaukee and its tributaries <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> prairies {{with little or no}} tree cover. It was only once the prairies were farmed that trees began to thrive along the shores of the river, {{creating}} ideal habitat for river otters. Today the Kishwaukee provides enough food, water, shelter and space for river otters to inhabit it.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} {{survivors}} included Fidel and Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, {{alone or in}} small groups, <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again – {{with the help of}} peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including Celia Sanchez and Haydée Santamaría (the sister of Abel Santamaria), also assisted Fidel Castro's operations in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, Catherine {{approved}} the subsidisation of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was {{another attempt to}} organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the nomadic people who <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> southern Russia. In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system, to be regulated by the government. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people to settle. This allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen {{under the jurisdiction of}} Russian law.|$|E

25|$|The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as {{the first}} green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest as she waited in happy {{anticipation}} for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds and yellows of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not {{come back to the}} land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and listless, she <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Van Orman survived other, less inspiring incidents: {{once he was}} {{assaulted}} by an unidentified man, allegedly hired by one of Van Orman's competitors; on another occasion during prohibition period he landed a balloon {{in the middle of}} an illegal distillery operation, and was confronted by bootleggers wielding shotguns who mistook him for a federal agent. During the 1933 National Race Van Orman's balloon flew deep into Canadian forests. He and his partners <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the wilderness, starving; back at home they were already considered dead. Finally, they reached a telephone line running through the forest; they chopped down a pole, severing the line, expecting that a repair crew will eventually locate them. After this incident Van Orman, a single parent (his first wife died in 1932), quit balloon racing forever.|$|E
25|$|The Elder Sampson had {{converted}} from Anglicanism to Orthodoxy {{at the age}} of 14. He received a degree in medicine and a theological education, and in 1918 he joined a monastic community near Petrograd. In the same year, he was arrested and taken to a mass execution where he survived by being wounded and covered up with the other bodies. He was rescued by fellow monks from the heap. He later became a priest. In 1929 he was arrested again and was released in 1934. He was arrested again in 1936 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He served these years as a prison doctor in Central Asia, and for this reason the authorities did not wish to release him due to the need for his service when his term came to an end in 1946. He escaped and <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the desert, while successfully avoiding capture. He went on to do pastoral work without any legal papers. He died in 1979, and was remembered as a saint by those who knew him.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of his mother, {{probably}} at the birth of his sister Richera, Anselm's father repented his earlier lifestyle but professed his new faith with a severity that the boy found likewise unbearable. Once Gundulph had entered a convent, Anselm, at age 23, left home with a single attendant, crossed the Alps, and <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> Burgundy and France for three years. His countryman Lanfranc of Pavia was then prior of the Benedictine abbey of Bec; attracted by the fame of his fellow countryman, Anselm reached Normandy in 1059. After spending some time in Avranches, he returned the next year. His father having died, he consulted with Lanfranc as to whether to return to his estates and employ their income in providing alms or to renounce them, becoming a hermit or a monk at Bec or Cluny. Professing to fear his own bias, Lanfranc sent him to Maurilius, the archbishop of Rouen, who convinced him to enter the abbey as a novice at the age of 27. Probably in his first year, he wrote his first work on philosophy, a treatment of Latin paradoxes called the Grammarian. Over the next decade, the Rule of Saint Benedict reshaped his thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 he {{emigrated from}} Iran {{with his brother}} to India, in search of {{economic}} opportunities among the long-established Parsi community. After brief employment in Bombay, he gave away {{most of the money}} he had saved and resumed his mystical quest. He <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> Gujarat and Sindh among other places for another ten years, begging only when he was hungry. Disappointed that nearly two decades of dervishi had not led him to spiritual realization, he returned to Bombay where his sister Piroja now lived. Slowly integrating into conventional life, he reluctantly became betrothed to a young girl, Shireen Khuramshahi, whose family had also immigrated from his birthplace. The marriage took place 8 years later in 1892 when Shireen came of age: she was 14 and Sheriar 39. To support his new lifestyle he became first a gardener and later the owner of a successful palm wine business in Poona (present-day Pune) where the couple moved in 1893. In all Sheriar and Shireen had nine children – seven sons and two daughters. Of these, three died in childhood: one son Shirmund at seven months, a second Jehangir at two years, and a daughter Freiny who died of plague at age six in 1902.|$|E
500|$|According {{to the old}} Jain book Acaranga Sutra, {{the last}} (24th) great Tirthankara Mahavira had <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> this land, {{referred}} to as the [...] "pathless country of Ladha in Vajjabhumi and Subbhabhumi (probably Suhma)" [...] in the 5th century, B.C. According to some historians, the spread of Jainism and Buddhism in the Rarh region was {{part of the process of}} Aryanisation of the area. Based on Divyabdan, a Buddhist text, Dr. Atul Sur has inferred that Gautam Buddha probably traversed this area to go to Pundravardhana and Samatata.|$|E

He compares her {{to one of}} Coronation Streets original characters Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), as she is [...] "warm {{and comforting}} [...] loves cats and has had her share of lodgers"; however, Little notes that [...] "while Minnie <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> life in a haze, Betty is sharp-witted, blessed with insight and wisdom". Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: [...] "She hasn't always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith {{heard the}} {{exchange}} of fire from his position in the town moments after he received the request for reinforcements from Laurie. He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith {{was concerned about the}} four companies that had been at Barrett's, since their route to town was now unprotected. When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look. [...] One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, [...] "If we had fired, I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired." [...] During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> both sides selling hard cider.|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He <b>wandered</b> <b>through</b> the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
