5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular <b>weblog</b> sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{into the}} role of <b>weblogs</b> in {{supporting}} preservice teachers during their teaching practice and the key factors determining their engagement with <b>weblogs.</b> Underlying our study is an integrative approach that puts <b>weblogs</b> alongside with other popular media in use. An online community was intentionally built with <b>weblogs</b> to facilitate reflection and social interaction among dispersed preservice teachers. In parallel, multiple channels of communication were employed for peer interaction. <b>Weblogs</b> were perceived as valuable in relieving isolation, documenting their experience, and expressing their personal feelings. Instant Messenger and phone were rated as the most frequently used media. This study sustains our conviction that the integrative approach is vital to have a comprehensive picture of interaction among a community. Our study deepens the insights into the distinct benefit of <b>weblogs</b> as educational media and informs the future development of an online community with <b>weblogs.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Altena and Ngwenya find that <b>weblogs</b> provide an innovative means of funerary expression. They argue that <b>weblogs</b> are important mediators to help patients and their bereaved to cope with their illness, imminent death and mourning. Furthermore, the patients' comprehension and acceptance of their situation through the use of <b>weblogs</b> could possibly help in the prediction of their mental and physical health improvement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{both the}} communicative purposes and formal linguistic features of academic <b>weblogs.</b> An initial analysis of 496 <b>weblogs</b> in use within tertiary level institutions {{was reduced to}} an in-depth analysis of 39 academic <b>weblogs</b> (a corpus of 16 million words). The objective was {{to see how much}} variation there might be between traditional academic genres and academic <b>weblogs.</b> The initial hypothesis is that academic <b>weblogs</b> are far less formal and would favour greater use of lexico-grammatical realisations belonging to the interpersonal function of language. In order to quantify this possible variation between traditional academic genres and academic <b>weblogs,</b> some well-known linguistic features which have been considered to be typical of academic discourse such as the agentless passive and nominalisations were investigated...|$|R

5000|$|A network {{analysis}} of <b>weblogs</b> connected to campaigning in the German federal election 2005 was, e.g., conducted by Steffen Albrecht, Maren Lübcke and Rasco Hartig-Perschke. 317 campaign <b>weblogs</b> by politicians and non-political actors were examined along three dimensions of analysis: activity, interactivity, and connectedness. The sample was selected using search engines, existing pertinent lists and the snowball approach. Some of the aspects that were analyzed are {{the quantity of}} postings by the blog author, the quantity of feedback received from readers and “the connectedness of <b>weblogs</b> by means of blogroll links”. [...] The {{network analysis}} revealed the network structure of the blogosphere, showing that the interconnection of blogs was not that prevalent during the 2005 election campaign. Out of the 317 examined campaign <b>weblogs</b> the “majority of the blogs (187, 59%) had no blogroll links to other campaign blogs”. Furthermore, party-oriented <b>weblogs</b> primarily link to <b>weblogs</b> of the same party.|$|R

Interactive Learning Environments, 18, 245 - 261. doi: 10. 1080 / 10494820. 2010. 500530 This {{study examined the}} use of <b>weblogs</b> {{as a means to}} promote student teachers’ reflective practice. The assumption that <b>weblogs</b> are suitable tools for supporting and stimulating reflection on action in teacher training and consequently for enhancing the students’ ability to reflect, was explored. Three groups of student teachers used <b>weblogs</b> during an eight-week internship for reflection on teaching practice. Students were asked (a) to reflect on their own teaching experiences and (b) to provide peer feedback. Analyses of the student contributions show that <b>weblogs</b> are useful for reflection on critical incidents in the classroom and that they can stimulate interconnectivity in groups of students. Unfortunately <b>weblogs</b> do no incite deep reflection or spiral reflection. This can only be the result of explicit reflection instruction. This exploratory study further shows that large-scale quantitative research is needed to back up the premise that <b>weblogs</b> are suitable tools for reflection...|$|R

This article presents a small scale study on the use of <b>weblogs</b> for English language learning at tertiary level in Malaysia. Twenty six students kept <b>weblogs</b> for a duration of a semester. This study investigated how students perceived the use of <b>weblogs</b> for English language learning.

40|$|Abstract — Today’s {{number of}} <b>weblogs</b> {{is higher than}} ever before and still growing. These blogs are {{interconnected}} by numerous links and other diverse connections, generating a series of notable patterns. <b>Weblogs</b> are not isolated and highly connected with other social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Thus, we analyze the references and investigate methods to gather data from the social platforms that are in-terconnected with <b>weblogs.</b> By analyzing the communication flow between <b>weblogs,</b> Facebook and Twitter, we observe that Facebook is mostly used for referencing real people instead of posts. In contrast, tweets are primarily used for information propagation and citation. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of journalism, <b>weblogs</b> {{can be seen as}} a new category of news and current affairs communication. Although most <b>weblogs</b> do not even pretend to be journal-istic or related to current events in the sense shared by institutional media, when bloggers approach the arena of journalism, some of their working principles can challenge tradi-tional professional standards: Conversation with the audience, transparency in the report-ing process or even participatory news production are common in blogging. By challeng-ing the conventional understanding of what journalism is, <b>weblogs</b> have revitalized the voices that expect a paradigm shift in journalism in the Internet era. In order to contrib-ute to the debate on the influences of <b>weblogs</b> on journalism and make it more system-atic, we propose a typology of journalistic <b>weblogs,</b> along a continuum ranging from the least to the most institutionalized in terms of their relationship to the established media: At one end, we find <b>weblogs</b> produced by the public outside media companies, and at the other end, we find those that are part of media content and produced by professional staff journalists. We argue that <b>weblogs</b> are a symbol of the ongoing change in the relationship between citizens, media and journalists – a change that questions the basic assumptions of the traditional roles of institutional journalism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative research study examining the perceptions and practices of inservice teachers who blog. Open-ended interviews and electronic dialogues were conducted with 16 K– 12 blog-gers to identify emergent themes. A content analysis of each participant’s <b>Weblogs</b> was conducted to confirm these findings. Findings suggest that when used by teachers, <b>Weblogs</b> can promote 1) reflective practice, and 2) collaboration and social interaction among users. Ethical issues related to the use of <b>Weblogs</b> are discussed as well. Reporting of this data may assist in forming {{a deeper understanding of the}} perceptions and practices related to teacher created, teacher centered <b>Weblogs.</b> In their simplest form, <b>Weblogs,</b> or blogs, can be thought of as electronic journals (Huffaker, 2004; Kennedy, 2003). According to Kennedy (2003), blogs are “part Web site, part journal, part free-form writing spaces [that] have the potential to enhance writing and literacy skills while offering a uniquely stylized form of expression ” (¶ 4).
