2500|$|Ubuntu has {{a server}} edition {{that uses the}} same APT {{repositories}} as the Ubuntu Desktop Edition. The differences between them are {{the absence of an}} X <b>Window</b> <b>environment</b> in a default installation of the server edition (although one can easily be installed, including Unity, GNOME, KDE or Xfce), and some alterations to the installation process. The server edition uses a screen-mode, character-based interface for the installation, instead of a graphical installation process. This enables installation on machines with a serial or [...] "dumb terminal" [...] interface without graphics support.|$|E

Thus, it can be used alternate between the two most recent tasks. The <b>window</b> <b>environment</b> maintains a Z-order list of top-level windows (tasks) with the most recently used tasks at the front and the desktop at the bottom, so the most recently used tasks can be switched to the most quickly.|$|E

Windows is more popular due to the ease in use, and effective GUI; due to the unavailability of windows component source code the crime investigations in <b>windows</b> <b>environment</b> is a tedious and hectic job for law enforcement agencies. The unsystematic organization of the available sources of evidence in a <b>windows</b> <b>environment</b> makes the integration of these evidences a difficult task.

50|$|The {{original}} version of Links {{was developed by}} Mikuláš Patočka in the Czech Republic. His group, Twibright Labs, later developed version 2 of the Links browser, that displays graphics, renders fonts in different sizes (with spatial anti-aliasing) but does not support JavaScript any more (it used to, up to version 2.1pre28). The resulting browser is very fast, {{but it does not}} display many pages as they were intended. The graphical mode works even on Unix systems without the X Window System or any other <b>window</b> <b>environment,</b> using either SVGALib or the framebuffer of the system's graphics card.|$|E
50|$|The Microsoft/Macintosh Runtime <b>Window</b> <b>Environment</b> (MRWE) option uses a Fortran 77 {{overarching}} {{main program}} that calls system GUI libraries {{to produce a}} windowed application. The MRWE environment is selected as an executable type in the IDE options for building an application. The default MRWE program maps input and output to a scrolling window similar to a command prompt, but the user retains all the output and can save it as a text file after the program exits. Hooks are provided in the MRWE GUI program to add Windows system calls to enhance the user interface, providing {{the potential for a}} full-featured Windows program written entirely in Fortran. MRWE source code is available {{as a starting point for}} an all-Fortran Win32 GUI application. MRWE was replaced by AWE in 2012 but is still available as a target environment for legacy programs.|$|E

50|$|When Microsoft {{announced}} Windows in November 1983, International Business Machines (IBM), Microsoft's important {{partner in}} popularizing MS-DOS for the IBM PC, notably did not announce {{support for the}} forthcoming <b>window</b> <b>environment.</b> IBM determined that the microcomputer market needed a multitasking environment. When it released TopView in 1985, the press speculated that the software {{was the start of}} IBM's plan to increase its control over the IBM PC (even though nothing about the IBM PC was proprietary (including the BIOS which was published to the world)) by creating a proprietary operating system for it, similar to what IBM had offered for years on its larger computers. TopView also allowed IBM to serve customers who were surprised that the new IBM AT did not come with an operating system able to use the hardware multitasking and protected mode features of the new 80286 CPU, as DOS and most applications were still running in 8086/8088 real mode.|$|E

40|$|After a short {{presentation}} of the two graphics standards and the X Window System, the impact of realizing PHIGS or GKS- 3 D in a <b>Window</b> <b>environment</b> is described. For output, a graphics workstation must use the X 2 D graphics elements and an X window as display surface. For Input, the X event queue will be used and must be controlled by a separate process. The usage of the PHIGS PLUS extensions leads to three possible solutions for transferring data over the network: usage of pixel maps, usage of X 2 D graphics or usage of X extensions. A comparison to the PEX (PHIGS PLUS Extension to X) protocol proposal will be made. The usage of X together with graphics standards leads to network-wide distributed graphics applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Using the Mel-frequency cepstral {{coefficients}} (MFCC), Human Factor cepstral coefficients (HFCC) {{and their}} new parameters derived from log dynamic spectrum and dynamic log spectrum, these features are widely used for speech recognition in various applications. But, speech recognition systems based on these features do not perform efficiently in the noisy conditions, mobile environment and for speech variation between users of different genders and ages. To maximize the recognition rate of speaker independent isolated word recognition system, we combine both of the above features and proposed a hybrid feature set of them. We tested the system for this hybrid feature vector and we gained results with accuracy of 86. 17 % in clean condition (closed window), 82. 33 % in class room open <b>window</b> <b>environment,</b> and 73. 67 % in outdoor with noisy environment...|$|E

40|$|MOCUP is {{a system}} of {{external}} processors that allow for a limited treatment of the temporal composition of the user-selected MCNP cells in a time-dependent flux environment. The ORIGEN 2 code computes the time-dependent compositions of these individually selected MCNP cells. All data communication between the two codes is accomplished through the MCNP and ORIGEN 2 input/output files, the MOCUP Processor Output files, and two user supplied tables. MOCUP is either command line or interactively driven. The interactive interface {{is based on the}} portable XII <b>window</b> <b>environment</b> and the Motif tool kit. MOCUP was constructed so that no modifications to either MCNP or ORIGEN 2 were necessary. Section 4 of the writeup contains the input instructions needed to set up the MOCUP run. MOCUP is extremely useful for analysts who perform isotope production, material transformation, and depletion and isotope analyses on complex, non-lattice geometries, and uniform and non-uniform lattices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{concrete}} salt-soaking durability test, the dynamic elastic modulus of concrete is {{more sensitive to}} {{the concrete}} damage than the mass, and can reflect the concrete durability better. In this paper，the relative dynamic elastic modulus of concrete is used as the evaluation index of concrete durability. Its attenuation law is made the multiple linear regression by using MATLAB software. The evaluation model and its applicable conditions of the relative dynamic elastic modulus of air-entraining concrete under the action of the long-term salt immersion are obtained, which can be used to evaluate and precast the durable degree of air-entraining concrete in the salt environment.
