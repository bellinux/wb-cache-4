5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force <b>without</b> <b>issue</b> and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging {{him to come to}} his principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died <b>without</b> <b>issue</b> was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E

Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{family had}} been exiled to the Continent in 1539. It is not known exactly when they {{returned}} to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence. Not much is known about {{the early years of the}} children. His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward. Sometime around Mary's accession, Cranmer's wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him too to the Continent. Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer's favourite publisher, Edward Whitchurch. The couple returned to England after Mary's reign and settled in Surrey. Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to Thomas Norton. Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott. She died in the 1570s. Both of Cranmer's children died <b>without</b> <b>issue</b> and his line became extinct.|$|E
5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take another with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join <b>without</b> <b>issue,</b> is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E

5|$|When his nephew, Arnold, died <b>without</b> <b>issue,</b> Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau (1532–1610) {{resigned}} {{from the office of}} Elector (September 1577) and, in December, married Antonia Wilhelmine d'Arenburg, sister of Charles d'Ligne, Prince of Arenberg. Salentin's resignation required the election of a new archbishop and prince-elector from among the Cathedral Chapter. Two candidates emerged. Gebhard (1547–1601) was the second son of William, Truchsess of Waldburg, known as William the younger, and Johanna von Fürstenberg. He was descended from the Jacobin line of the House of Waldburg; his uncle was a cardinal, and his family had significant imperial contacts. The second candidate, Ernst of Bavaria (1554–1612), was the third son of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria. As a member of the powerful House of Wittelsbach, Ernst could marshal support from his extensive family connections throughout the Catholic houses of the empire; he also had contacts in important canonic establishments at Salzburg, Trier, Würzburg, and Münster that could exert collateral pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys {{granted the}} manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with her}} heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died <b>without</b> <b>issue</b> in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred {{it in the same}} year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but the manor of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who held it in 1428.|$|E
5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, {{hoping he}} could claim the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died <b>without</b> <b>issue.</b> When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its territorial integrity.|$|E
