5|$|The {{species was}} once called the golden honeyeater {{as it was}} {{considered}} to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the <b>white-eyes.</b> Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian <b>white-eyes</b> of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the <b>white-eyes.</b> The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other <b>white-eyes</b> where that primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the <b>white-eyes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>white-eyes</b> are a {{large family}} of mostly Old World {{passerine}} birds. They are rather diverse in size and colouration, but are characterised by soft fluffy plumage. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in Southeast Asia. One species reaches Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's early {{research}} investigated South American seabirds and fossil birds from North America. She later specialised in Asian birds describing {{several new}} species and clarifying {{the status of}} others, particularly <b>white-eyes</b> and owls. More recently, she {{has been involved in}} large scale collaborations looking at patterns of global biodiversity, and has assessed the taxonomic status of South Asian vultures.|$|E
50|$|The African yellow <b>white-eye</b> may form a {{superspecies}} with Abyssinian <b>white-eye,</b> Montane <b>white-eye</b> and Orange River <b>white-eye.</b> The taxa from Central Africa, by most authorities considered subspecies of the African yellow <b>white-eye,</b> is now sometimes {{considered a}} separate species, the forest <b>white-eye,</b> (Zosterops stenocricotus).|$|R
50|$|The montane <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops poliogastrus), {{also known}} as the broad-ringed <b>white-eye,</b> is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It {{includes}} numerous subspecies, several of which are restricted to isolated mountains. Some of these are sometimes considered separate monotypic species, such as the Kulal <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops kulalensis), Taita <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops silvanus), South Pare <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops winifredae), Kikuyu <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops kikuyuensis), and Mbulu <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops mbuluensis).|$|R
50|$|The Marianne <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops semiflavus), {{also known}} as Seychelles chestnut-sided <b>white-eye</b> or Seychelles yellow <b>white-eye,</b> is an extinct species of small bird in the <b>white-eye</b> family.|$|R
5|$|The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 × 15.1mm in size, {{which are}} pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are {{concentrated}} around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled <b>white-eyes,</b> rufous fantails, and other golden <b>white-eyes.</b> From laying {{it takes about}} two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 1014 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>white-eyes</b> {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being {{typically}} greenish-olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. As the name suggests, many species have a white ring around each eyes.|$|E

5|$|Like other <b>white-eyes,</b> {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled <b>white-eyes</b> and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and on the forest floor. The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, <b>white-eyes,</b> wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other <b>white-eyes</b> in having large eyes and an {{outermost}} primary wing feather that is not reduced (as {{it is in the}} other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long and weighing around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
50|$|The ashy-bellied <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops citrinella) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Zosteropidae found in the Lesser Sunda Islands and {{northern}} Cape York Peninsula. It is sometimes called the pale <b>white-eye</b> or pale-bellied <b>white-eye,</b> but {{should not be confused}} with the pale-bellied <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops consobrinorum).|$|R
50|$|The Vella Lavella <b>white-eye,</b> belted <b>white-eye</b> or banded <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops vellalavella) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Abyssinian <b>white-eye</b> or white-breasted <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops abyssinicus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{belonging to}} the genus Zosterops in the <b>white-eye</b> family Zosteropidae. It is native to north-east Africa and southern Arabia.|$|R
5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled <b>white-eyes</b> (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E
25|$|It is {{speculated that}} they are {{threatened}} by competition with invasive species, including rats, <b>white-eyes,</b> and honey bees.|$|E
25|$|In some birds such as <b>white-eyes,</b> {{the pollen}} dusted by the plants on the {{forehead}} of the birds may increase the wear of these feathers leading to increased moulting and replacement.|$|E
50|$|The Karthala <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops mouroniensis), {{also known}} as the Mount Karthala <b>white-eye,</b> Grand Comore <b>white-eye,</b> or Comoro <b>white-eye,</b> is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. As {{suggested}} by its name, it is endemic to Philippia heath woodland growing on Mount Karthala on the island of Grand Comore in the Comoros. Mount Karthala is an active volcano and future eruptions pose a serious threat to the Karthala <b>white-eye.</b> The bird is further threatened by human-induced habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Vanuatu <b>white-eye</b> or yellow-fronted <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops flavifrons) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{belonging to}} the genus Zosterops in the <b>white-eye</b> family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to Vanuatu, where {{it is one of}} the most common birds.|$|R

25|$|Norfolk Island, with {{neighbouring}} Nepean Island, {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of white-chested and slender-billed <b>white-eyes,</b> Norfolk parakeets and Norfolk gerygones, as well as over 1% of the world populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds. Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA.|$|E
25|$|The family Hirundinidae was {{introduced}} (as Hirundia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The {{swallows and martins}} are morphologically unique within the passerines, with molecular evidence placing them as a distinctive lineage within the Sylvioidea (Old World warblers and relatives). They have also {{been linked to the}} <b>white-eyes</b> and the tits. Under the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy they have been placed in the infraorder Passerida.|$|E
25|$|Most bird pollinated {{flowers are}} red {{and have a}} lot of nectar. They also tend to be unscented. Flowers with generalist pollinators tend to have dilute nectar but those that have {{specialist}} pollinators such as hummingbirds or sunbirds tend to have more concentrated nectar. The nectar of ornithophilous flowers vary in the sugar composition, with hexoses being high in passerine pollinated species while those that are insect pollinated tend to be sucrose rich. Hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend to be sucrose rich. Many plants of the family Loranthaceae have explosive flowers that shower pollen on a bird that forages near it. They are associated mainly with flowerpeckers in the Dicaeidae family. In Australia, some species of Banksia have flowers that open in response to bird actions thereby reducing the wastage of pollen. In tropical dry forests in southern India, ornithophilous flowers were found to bloom mainly in the hot dry season. As many as 129 species of North American plants have evolved ornithophilous associations. Nearly a fourth of the 900 species of the genus Salvia are bird pollinated in the South African region. Tropical China and the adjacent Indochinese countries harbor relatively few bird-pollinated flowers, among them is Rhodoleia championii, a member of the Hamamelidaceae family, which at any one site can be visited and pollinated by up to seven species of nectar-foraging birds, including Japanese <b>white-eyes</b> (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae).|$|E
50|$|The black-crowned <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops atrifrons) is a {{songbird}} species. It {{is closely}} related to the Old World babblers, and its family Zosteropidae might better be included in the Tiimalidae. Its subspecies from the Sulawesi region might warrant recognition as distinct species Z. subatrifrons. The Sangihe <b>white-eye</b> (Z. nehrkorni) and the Seram <b>white-eye</b> (Z. stalkeri) were formerly included in Z. atrifrons, as is still, on occasion, the black-fronted <b>white-eye</b> (Z. minor).|$|R
50|$|The Mauritius grey <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops mauritianus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to Mauritius. It inhabits woodlands, forests, and gardens.

5|$|The golden <b>white-eye</b> (Cleptornis marchei) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>white-eye</b> family Zosteropidae. It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis. The golden <b>white-eye</b> was once {{considered}} to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a <b>white-eye,</b> its position within that family is still uncertain. The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands, where it is sympatric (shares its range) and competes with the related bridled <b>white-eye.</b> The golden <b>white-eye</b> has golden plumage and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit, and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The bird is monogamous and lays two eggs in a small cup nest.|$|R
