30|$|The {{paper by}} Cowan, Neuman and van Drongelen {{in the present}} {{collection}} [24] reviews {{the historical development of}} the mean field and stochastic Wilson–Cowan equations, and describes new results related to the statistical behavior of cortex under resting conditions and in response to weak and strong stimulation. The paper reviews experimental studies showing that (1) resting cortex exhibits sparse spontaneous activity that is temporally and spatially correlated; (2) when resting cortex is disturbed by a weak stimulus a wave of cortical activity propagates from the stimulation site at a large velocity (circa 0.3 mm/msec), <b>while</b> <b>decrementing</b> exponentially [41, 42]; and (3) when resting cortex is disturbed by a stronger stimulus a longer lived active state is evoked that propagates more slowly (circa 0.1 mm/msec). The authors argue that the resting cortex and the weakly driven cortex exist in a fluctuation driven regime, the statistical structure of which corresponds to a system near a continuous phase transition in the universality class of directed percolation, close to a Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation; and, moreover, that the essential features of the activity near this transition are captured by a stochastic Wilson–Cowan equation based on an underlying two-state model [4, 55]. In contrast, they argue that the strongly driven cortex enters a mean-driven state that is well described by the original mean-field equations.|$|E

However, decremental test patches are influenced equally [Schirillo & Shevell, 1996. Vision Research, 36, 1783 – 1796]. In the current study, we manipulate the spatial arrangement of a checkerboard surround to produce T-junctions that perceptually group the checks with the test patch. These stimuli alter the inducing effects of the checks. For one modified surround, increments appeared ∼ 8 % darker and decrements appeared ∼ 10 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification. In a second modified surround, that resembled White's illusion [White, 1979. Perception, 8, 413 – 416], increments again appeared ∼ 8 % darker, <b>while</b> <b>decrements</b> appeared a dramatic ∼ 23 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification.

40|$|<b>While</b> <b>decrements</b> {{in memory}} {{following}} temporal lobectomy for intractable epilespy remain a major neurocognitive complication of surgical intervention, {{it has been}} difficult to identify patients who are most at risk for developing decrements in their memory functions following surgery. Two different models f hippocampal func-tioning have been posited to account for pos surgical memory losses: hippocampal reserve versus functional adequacy. This article briefly examines the basis of the traditional model of hippocampal reserve, which suggests that it i e reserve or capacity of the contralateral hippocampus to support memory after surgery that determines whether changes in memory function will be observed. A m re indepth review of emerging data from studies of function (baseline neuropsychological test-ing and intracarotid amytal procedure) and structure (histologic cell densities and MRI volumetrics) supporting a functional adequacy model of hippocampal func-tioning is then presented.

We applied time series analysis for extracting the data over the descending phases of solar activity cycles (SACs) 21, 22 and 23, and the ascending phases 22 and 23 of SACs, and analyzed the selected data using the Python programming language. Our detailed analysis results suggest that there is a stronger correlation between solar surface indices and the changes in the relative portion of the small and large SGs. This somewhat unexpected finding suggest that plage regions decreased in a lower values in spite of the higher number of large SGs in SAC 23 while Ca II K-flux did not decrease by large amount or it was comparable with SAC 22 for some years and relates with C type and DEF type SGs. Thus, increase of facular areas which are influenced by large SGs caused a small percentage decrease in TSI <b>while</b> <b>decrement</b> of plage areas triggered a higher decrease in the flux of magnetic field. Our results thus reveal the potential of such detailed comparison of SG analysis with solar surface indices for understanding and predicting future trends in the SAC.

Both size increments and size decrements caused distraction in forced-choice task performance, which was mirrored by a posterior negativity (peaking at around 240 - 260 ms, posterior N 2) and a broad positivity (420 - 460 ms, P 3 a) that reflected attentional capture.

30|$|The {{logarithmic}} decrement of a tissue’s natural oscillation characterizes its elasticity, but more directly, {{it reflects the}} dissipation of the mechanical energy within an oscillation cycle, when tissues recover their shape after being deformed. Said another way, elasticity is the biomechanical property of a muscle that characterizes the ability to recover its initial shape after a contraction or removal of an external force of deformation. Elasticity is inversely proportional to the decrement. Therefore, as the decrement of a muscle decreases, the muscle elasticity increases. In theory, a decrement of 0 (zero) represents absolute elasticity. Elasticity is reported as the logarithmic <b>decrement,</b> <b>while</b> the inverse of elasticity is plasticity.|$|R

Based on our findings, we suggest a voltage range that may be employed as an aversive stimulus <b>while</b> minimizing <b>decrements</b> in physical performance and other aspects of behaviour. Additionally, we outline a novel method for constructing electric shock platforms that overcome some of the constraints of traditional methods while being highly effective and easily modifiable to suit the study animal and experimental context.

However, in adolescents, some theories hypothesize a neurobiological imbalance proposing heightened sensitivity to affective material in the amygdala and striatum within a cognitive control context. Yet, direct neurobiological evidence is scarce. Twenty-four adolescents (12 – 16) and 28 adults (25 – 35) completed an emotional n-back working memory task in response to happy, angry, and neutral faces during fMRI.

The {{results indicate that the}} net-like intermetallic compounds (mainly I-phase) dissolve into the メ-Mg matrix gradually with the increase of solution temperature from 440 ìC to 480 ìC. Besides, the I-phase decomposes completely at 480 ìC, with the formation of fine W-phase (thermal stable phase) and Mg 7 Zn 3 phase. In addition, a great number of fine and dispersive Mg-Zn binary phases precipitate in the メ-Mg matrix during the aging treatment. Due to the increase of solute atoms and the precipitation of strengthening phases, such as W-phase and Mg-Zn phases, the optimal strength is obtained after solution treatment at 460 ìC for 8 h and aged at 200 ìC for 16 h.

MMN was recorded for increments and decrements in frequency and duration in 20 adults. The stimuli (standard/deviant) were 250 Hz/ 350 Hz (frequency MMN) and 200 ms/ 300 ms (duration MMN) for increment MMN and vice versa for decrement MMN. Amplitude of MMN was calculated in two ways: the traditional method (subtracting ERP to the standard from the deviant presented in the same block) and the same-stimulus method (subtracting ERP to identical stimuli presented as standard in one block and deviant in another block). We found that increments in frequency produced higher MMN amplitudes compared to decrements for both methods of calculation. For duration deviance, the decrement MMN was absent in the traditional method, <b>while</b> the <b>decrement</b> and increment MMN did not differ for the same-stimulus method.

Furthermore, {{there is a significant}} and growing debate in the literature regarding the putative role of attention in the encoding of expectations in perception. The question then arises as to what are the behavioral and neural consequences, if any, of attention decrement on temporal {{expectations and}} related enhancement of sensory information processing. Here, we investigated behavioral performance and visual N 1 a, N 1 p and P 1 components during a sustained attention reaction time task inducing attention decrement under two conditions. In one condition, the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) were randomly distributed to impede expectation effects while for the other, the ISI exhibited natural-like long-term correlations supposed to induce temporal expectations. Behavioral results show that natural-like fluctuations in ISI indeed induced faster RT due to temporal expectations. These temporal expectations were beneficial even under attention decrement circumstances. Further, temporal expectations were associated with reduced N 1 a amplitude <b>while</b> attention <b>decrement</b> was associated with reduced N 1 p amplitude. Our findings provide evidence that the effects of temporal expectations and attention decrement induced in a single task can be independent at the behavioral level, and are supported at separate information processing stages at the neural level in vision...|$|R

The first level clusters the training data into spheres, obtaining one sphere for each class.

The aging methods are: (selective aging) decrement TTL of a waiting packet when a duplicate is received and (global aging) decrement when any packet is received.

We use detailed, realistic simulation for medium scale networks (up to 800 nodes); for networks of any size, we use an analytical method based on fluid approximation and solution of a fixed point problem.

40|$|The present thesis {{employed}} event-related potentials, {{the minute}} {{responses of the}} brain, to examine the differences in processing of increases and decreases in auditory intensity. The manner in which intensity was manipulated (i. e., whether it represented physical or psychological change) varied across the studies of the thesis. Study 1 investigated the processing of physical intensity change during wakefulness and natural sleep. An oddball paradigm (80 dB standard, 90 dB increment, 60 dB decrement) was presented to subjects during the waking state and during sleep. The increment elicited a larger deviant-related negativity and P 3 a than the decrement in the waking state. During sleep, only the increment deviant continued to elicit ERPs related to the detection of change. The waking and sleeping findings {{support the notion that}} increases in intensity are more salient to an observer. Studies 2 and 3 of this thesis determined the degree to which this differential salience could be attributed to the fact that intensity increments result in increased activation of the change and transient detection systems <b>while</b> intensity <b>decrements</b> result in greater activation of only the change detection system. In order to address this question, an alternating intensity pattern was employed (HLHLHLHL) with deviants created by the repetition of a tone in the sequence (HLHLHHHL) that violated the expectancy for a higher (psychological decrements) or lower intensity tone (psychological increments). Because deviant stimuli were physically identical to preceding standards, this manipulation should not have led to increased output of the transient detection system (N 1 enhancement), permitting isolation of the output of the change detection system (Mismatch Negativity, MMN). The findings of these studies indicated that psychological increments resulted in shorter latency and larger amplitude MMNs than psychological decrements and that these differences could not be explained by the physical differences between deviant stimuli or temporal integration. 	This thesis provides convincing evidence that stimuli representing increments in intensity result in faster and more robust change detection. Further, the increased salience of increment stimuli cannot be solely explained by the contribution of transient detector activation, as it persists even when deviance-related processing is isolated to the change detection system...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess Craik's prediction by examining the onset of age decline in two retrospective and three prospective memory tasks in the samples of young (18 - 30 years), young-old (61 - 70 years), and old-old (71 - 80 years) participants recruited from the local community. Results showed that although the magnitude of age effects varied across the laboratory prospective memory tasks, they were smaller than age effects in a simple three-item free recall task. Moreover, <b>while</b> reliable age <b>decrements</b> in both retrospective memory tasks of recognition and free recall were already present in the young-old group, in laboratory tasks of prospective memory they were mostly present in the old-old group only. In addition, older participants were more likely to report a retrospective than prospective memory failure as their most recent memory lapse, while the opposite pattern was present in young participants. Taken together, these findings highlight the theoretical importance of distinguishing effects of ageing on prospective and retrospective memory, and support and extend the results of a recent meta-analysis by Henry, MacLeod, Phillips, and Crawford (2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Each of 42 college {{subjects}} performed {{first on}} a conjunctive attribute identification task {{and then was}} subjected to one of seven treatment conditions, six experimental and one filler control. The six conditions resulted from variations of two nested factors: Experience (success vs. failure) followed by Reference Group Norm (above- vs. equal-to- vs. below-RGN). Finally, each subject performed on a conjunc-tive criterion task similar to the initial one. Having repeatedly succeeded initially, the subjects given equal-to-RGN feedback performed most efficiently, while those given above- or below-RGN feedback did not perform any better than the control subjects. Having repeatedly failed initially, the subjects given equal-to-RGN feedback showed the most performance <b>decrement,</b> <b>while</b> those given above- or below-RGN feedback did not show any performance decrement. These findings were interpreted to {{support the hypothesis that}} the subjective probability induced by normative feedback mediates performance via an experimentally produced motive-like orientation. It is a commonly observable sequence of events in or outside of classrooms that learners encounter unfamiliar learning tasks, and try them out on their own {{to see if they can}} master them (criterion-referenced feedback). Sooner or later, they would also find out how well they did as compared to others (norm-referenced feedback). Despite the ubiquity of such a sequence of feedback events and the apparent need for careful study, the research literature in concept learning shows that very few studies to date have investigated the role of feedback a...|$|R
5000|$|Douglas {{described}} Social Credit as [...] "the {{policy of}} a philosophy", and warned against considering it solely as a scheme for monetary reform. He called this philosophy [...] "practical Christianity" [...] {{and stated that}} its central issue is the Incarnation. Douglas believed {{that there was a}} Canon which permeated the universe, and Jesus Christ was the Incarnation of this Canon. However, he also believed that Christianity remained ineffective so long as it remained transcendental. Religion, which derives from the Latin word religare (to “bind back”), was intended to be a binding back to reality. Social Credit is concerned with the incarnation of Christian principles in our organic affairs. Specifically, it is concerned with the principles of association and how to maximize the increments of association which redound to satisfaction of the individual in society - <b>while</b> minimizing any <b>decrements</b> of association.The goal of Social Credit is to maximize immanent sovereignty. Social credit is consonant with the Christian doctrine of salvation through unearned grace, and is therefore incompatible with any variant of the doctrine of salvation through works. Works need not be of Purity in intent or of desirable consequence and in themselves alone are as [...] "filthy rags". For instance, the present system makes destructive, obscenely wasteful wars a virtual certainty - which provides much [...] "work" [...] for everyone. Social credit has been called the Third Alternative to the futile Left-Right Duality.|$|R

This thesis reports on the impact of combined heat and noise on the performance of a short-term memory retention task with two levels of difficulty. Thirty-two males, ages 18 - 35, were exposed to four different treatment conditions during four one hour sessions. These four treatment conditions consisted of: a control environment, a noise environment a heat environment, and a combined heat and noise environment. Temperatures during the control and noise conditions were maintained between 68 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit while temperatures during the heat and combined conditions were maintained at 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Sound exposure levels during the noise and combined conditions averaged at 83. 7 decibels with peak frequency exposures never exceeding 93. 5 decibels for ten seconds. The task to be performed was a computerized version of game "Concentration". Subjects were presented with both a 6 x 8 and an 8 x 8 grid of blank tiles and asked to correctly match as many tile pairs as they could in three minutes. The task was repeated twice for each grid. Results from the 6 x 8 grid showed performance decrements for all three stress conditions with combined heat and noise showing the greatest performance decrement. However, none of these decrements were found to be significantly different from the control environment or from each other at an Alpha level of. 05. Further, no significant evidence was found to show that the combined effects of heat and noise exceed the effects of either stressor singularly. Results from the 8 x 8 grid proved to be different. <b>While</b> performance <b>decrements</b> were observed for the heat and noise conditions alone, the greatest overall performance scores were observed during the combined stress condition. Again, none of these scores were found to be significantly different from the control environment or from each other at an Alpha level of. 05. It appears, from these results, that heat and noise stress, experienced either singularly or in combination does not {{have a significant effect on}} short-term memory or overall performance degradation...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} factor of endoprostheses {{is the quality}} of the tribological pairing. The objective of this research project is to manufacture stochastically porous aluminum oxide surface coatings with high wear resistance and an active friction minimization. There are many experimental and computational techniques from mercury porosimetry to imaging methods for studying porous materials, however, the characterization of disordered pore networks is still a great challenge. To meet this challenge it is striven to gain a three dimensional high resolution reconstruction of the surface. In this work, the reconstruction is approached by repeatedly milling down the surface by a fixed <b>decrement</b> <b>while</b> measuring each layer using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The so acquired depth data of the successive layers is then registered pairwise. Within this work a direct registration approach is deployed and implemented in two steps, a coarse and a fine alignment. The coarse alignment of the depth data is limited to a translational shift which occurs in horizontal direction due to placing the sample in turns under the CLSM and the milling machine and in vertical direction due to the milling process itself. The shift is determined by an approach utilizing 3 D phase correlation. The fine alignment is implemented by the Trimmed Iterative Closest Point algorithm, matching the most likely common pixels roughly specified by an estimated overlap rate. With the presented two-step approach a proper 3 D registration of the successive depth data of the layer is obtained. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

40|$|Although {{automated}} {{systems have}} decreased the information-processing load on workers and have increased productivity, {{studies have shown}} that automation can have serious drawbacks, such as reductions in operator vigilance that can lead to decreased detection of critical events. Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is a tool used to measure cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), and previous {{studies have shown that}} TCD can be used to examine attentional resource utilization and allocation during vigilance task performance. This study was designed to assess the attentional resource utilization of an individual difference measure that has shown to be associated with vigilance performance efficiency, extraversion. Twelve extraverts and thirteen introverts monitored a 60 -min vigilance task for critical signals, which in this case, was the absence of a line on one of the five circles displayed on a computer monitor. CBFV and correct detections over six 10 -min periods were used as the units of analysis. <b>While</b> a vigilance <b>decrement</b> was observed, {{there was no difference in}} detection efficiency between extraverts and introverts. The results pertaining to the CBFV measure reveal a significant hemisphere x personality interaction, such that the lateralization effect often present in vigilance was restricted to introverts. The results are interpreted in terms of findings suggesting that bilateral activation is a function of task difficulty: extraverts were recruiting mental resources from both the left and right cerebral hemispheres while introverts were using resources from only the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that the TCD measure is diagnostic of resource allocation associated with individual differences in vigilance...|$|R
