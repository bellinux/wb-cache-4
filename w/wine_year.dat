50|$|The {{opposite}} of a vintage wine is a nonvintage wine (often {{seen on a}} wine list as NV), which is usually a blend from the produce {{of two or more}} years. This is a common practice for winemakers seeking a consistent style of <b>wine,</b> <b>year</b> on year.|$|E
30|$|Sura, or palm wine, makers {{harvest and}} ferment sap from kindu (Phoenix reclinata Jacq.) to make <b>wine</b> <b>year</b> round. The plant’s spiny lower {{branches}} and dead material are burned off to make tapping the main stem easier. Plant material {{could be cut}} and removed by hand, but the large spines on the lower branches make this process difficult. Field observations demonstrated that burning does not kill the plant and actually stimulates new growth. Kindu grows in stands in open woodland near water and on slightly elevated sites in wooded savanna. After {{three to four months}} of use, the palms are left to regrow before the burn and harvest cycle begins again. Lala palm (Hyphaene coriacea Gaertn.) is harvested extensively for sura farther south, but not in Madjadjane or Gala.|$|E
30|$|The {{characteristics}} like {{brand and}} organoleptic attributes are appreciated only by Prosecco CGDO consumers. This {{is not surprising}} since the CGDO wineries are most prestigious, {{date back to the}} middle of the 20 th century, and create a strong reputation associated to Prosecco <b>wine</b> <b>year</b> by year. In addition, if the CGDO wineries specialize in Prosecco production, the CDO ones produce a wide range of wines (still red, rosè and white, wine from dried grapes, etc.) and their name is generally less associated to Prosecco wine. The fact that the CGDO consumer pays more attention to organoleptic attributes could be due to his superior knowledge about Prosecco. It is likely that people willing to pay more and who choose historical Prosecco wineries have a better knowledge about Prosecco characteristics, and consequently prefer the organoleptic attributes reported on the label.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{working for}} wine-related {{magazines}} generally review new releases, often {{in comparison with}} other wines from the same region, grape variety, or vintage.

40|$|Cross-selective {{receptor}} arrays {{coupled with}} higher-order neural processing {{can be seen}} in naturally occurring olfactory systems, where a large number and variety of analytes can be detected, distinguished, even quantified using relatively few receptors and clever combinatorial odor decoding. This strategy has been imitated in artificial sensor array systems that are paired with computational signal-processing tools in diverse applications that range from vintage <b>wine</b> <b>year</b> discrimination to disease diagnosis. However, the com-plexity of receptor response patterns to even a single analyte, coupled with non-linearity of response to mixtures of analytes, makes quantitative inference of individual compound concentrations within mixtures a challenging task. In this work, I show how output from two distinct types of sensor arrays, each combined with Bayesian analysis, can be used to predict component concentrations in complex mixtures. In the first case, the array con-sists of four engineered G-protein-coupled receptors used for deciphering mixtures of highly related sugar nucleotides. We employ a biophysical model that explicitly takes receptor-ligand interactions into account in order to quantify mixture constituents. Furthermore, we develop a universal metric of receptor array performance, and use it to study the funda...|$|E
