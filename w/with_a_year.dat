5|$|Prior to the 2004 season, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> {{remaining}} on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth $21million, with {{an option for}} a third year. That season, Rivera surpassed 300career saves and made his sixth All-Star team with 32saves at the midseason break, then an AL record. His final numbers for the year included a 1.94ERA and a career-high 53saves in 57opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees' victory in the 2004 AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives {{who had died in}} an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series. Boston's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{stayed at}} Cambridge for the 201617 season, with the {{campaign}} following a similar pattern to the previous year {{as he was in}} and out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their first game of the season as they won 21 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game when he turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 10 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd minute equaliser in an eventual 42 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd minute winner in a 32 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a rebound in a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had been placed on the transfer-list <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> remaining on his contract.|$|E
