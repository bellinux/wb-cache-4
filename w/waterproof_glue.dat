5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5000|$|Henry L. Haskell {{devised a}} way to make <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> in 1913 from a {{derivative}} of dried cow blood. He used this adhesive to put together cross-grained thin veneer layers of wood to create a product referred to as a flat sheet [...] "panel"-now known as plywood ("plies" [...] of wood). The plywood was named Haskelite after himself. In 1915, he innovated a method to mold this plywood into three dimensional shapes using heat, hydraulic pressure and his patented <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} drift {{boats were}} {{made out of}} various types of wood. Plywood with <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> became available in the late 1930s, and plywood quickly became the construction material of choice for dory builders like Woodie Hindman. Later, boats were made with lower maintenance materials like aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic.|$|E

50|$|Traditional carvel methods leave a small {{gap between}} each plank {{that in the past}} was filled with any {{suitable}} soft, flexible, fibrous material, sometimes combined with a thick binding substance. This caulking would gradually wear out and the hull would leak. Likewise, when the boat was beached for a length of time, the planks would dry and shrink, so when first refloated, the hull would leak badly unless recaulked — a very time-consuming and physically demanding job. The modern variation is to use much narrower planks that are edge-glued instead of caulked. With modern power sanders a much smoother hull is produced, as all the small ridges between the planks can be removed. This method started to become more common in the 1960s with the more widespread availability of <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues,</b> such as resorcinol (red glue) and then epoxy resin. Modern <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues,</b> especially epoxy resin, have caused revolutionary changes in both carvel and clinker style construction. Whereas in traditional construction it was the nails that provided the fastening strength, now it is the glue. It has become quite common since the 1980s for both carvel and clinker construction to rely almost completely on glue for fastening. Many small boats, especially light plywood skiffs, are built without any mechanical fasteners such as nails and lag screws at all, as the glue is far stronger.|$|R
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} because this resin can cause severe {{allergic contact dermatitis}} in {{a significant percentage of}} individuals who come into contact with the resin. Most cases of dermatitis result from contact with shoes, watchbands, belts, fabric glues, wet suits, handbags, purses, wallets, hats, fabric glues, furniture and upholstery <b>glues,</b> wood <b>glues,</b> <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues,</b> rubber handled tools, dental bonding resins, box adhesives, disposable diapers, lip liner, and rubber athletic insoles. Use of PTBP-FR in manufacturing is ubiquitous across numerous industries and commercial products, but most commonly its usage in the manufacture of shoes is implicated in the majority of cases involving contact dermatitis.|$|R
5000|$|Haskelite [...] is {{the brand}} name of a plywood, once made by the Michigan based Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation. It was made from <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> {{developed}} by Henry L. Haskell. The moldable plywood was originally called Ser-O-Ply. It {{was used in the}} construction of various vehicles including military tanks, boats, airplanes, buses, trucks, and automobiles.|$|E
50|$|Lower grade timber is {{converted}} to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22 mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7 mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue.</b> Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to 6 m lengths {{in a wide range}} of profiles.|$|E

5000|$|Before World War I, the Cowes-based firm of S.E. Saunders Ltd {{was well}} known for its motor boats and in {{particular}} for Sam Saunder's patented method of jointing plywood structures for marine environments. In the absence of <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues,</b> Saunders sewed sheets together with copper wire, a method known by the trade name Consuta. Consuta-built hulls were produced by Saunders for several flying boats between 1912 and 1915, {{but most of the}} company's war time was spent building other companies' designs. [...] The T.1 (T for Henry Haberfield Thomas, its designer) was the first all-Saunders aircraft, appearing in 1917.|$|R
5000|$|Laminated bows {{were rare}} {{in most of}} the world before modern <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues</b> became widely available, almost unknown before about 1900CE, and outside Japan and Northern Asia they have never formed a {{significant}} proportion of traditional bows. The modern Japanese bow however is a laminated bow, as is the Korekawa bow from the late Jōmon period in Japan, and the Saami and their neighbours across Northern Eurasia [...] also made laminated bows for centuries. Insulander speculates that these may have been a step {{in the evolution of the}} composite bow. Hijāzi Arabs may also have used a laminated bow.|$|R
50|$|Des {{was one of}} {{the early}} adopters of mass {{production}} in recreational boatbuilding using the postwar (WW2) available <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues</b> - in this case Resin Syrup by Desford or Cascade as used in construction of the De Havilland Mosquito aircraft not so many years earlier. He also developed efficient techniques for removing staples from the veneer after glue setting using the recently released synthetic packaging strap which was starting to replace metal binding. Staples were set through the strapping when the veneers were fixed. Staple removal mostly was achieved by pulling up one of the strap with the staples still engaged saving substantial time over traditional removal, and with less veneer damage.|$|R
50|$|Chosen for {{its high}} gum content, agba formed easily without {{splitting}} and glued well. All the dinghy classes used just three agba veneers {{while some of}} the bigger boats used up to six. Initially all the veneers were laid at 45° while later boats changed to fore and aft outer planking for aesthetic reasons.With the keel, stem and transom in place, veneers were applied starting on the centreline and working out towards the shear. Each veneer was held in place by just three staples at the keel, bilge and shearline. Roller-application of Borden One-Shot <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> preceded each veneer except the first. With all veneers in place a vacuum bag was drawn over the moulding and secured in place using a clamp plate and G-clamps.Early vacuum bags were made from war surplus barrage balloon fabric. After about 1950, individual rubber bags were prepared on the moulds using uncured rubber sheets which were subsequently vulcanised in the autoclaves used for production.|$|E
5000|$|A {{laminated}} ski is a ski {{composed of}} {{two different types of}} wood which are glued together. A top layer of soft wood is glued to a thin layer under a surface of hardwood. This combination actually created skis which were much lighter and more maneuverable than the heavy, hardwood skis that preceded them [...] Although lighter and stronger, laminated skis did not wear well. The water-soluble glues used at the time failed; warping and splitting along the glue edges (delaminating) occurred frequently and rapidly. In 1922, a Norwegian skier Thorbjorn Nordby, developed strong, <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> which stopped the problem of splitting, therefore developing a much tougher laminated ski. Research and design of laminated skis rapidly progressed. In 1933 a new design technology was introduced involving an outer hardwood shell completely encasing an inner layer of lighter wood, successfully eliminating spontaneously splitting glue lines. This early design eventually evolved into an advanced laminating technique which is referred to today as Single-shell casing technology.|$|E
5000|$|Haskell {{invented a}} formula for a <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> in 1913. The glue was made from blood-album. From this glue he made a {{material}} of [...] "plies" [...] of crossed grain layers of wood, that is known today as plywood. Haskell named this composite material after himself with the brand name Haskelite. He worked out the mechanics {{of being able to}} mold and shape this plywood into three dimensions. From this plywood he made a canoe that was molded from one piece of plywood. The canoe plywood was shaped by hydraulic presses as an innovation devised by Haskell. The unusually designed canoe of no skeleton framework or ribs was given the brand name Arex ("king of the water") and made out of the Haskell Manufacturing Company building on N. Rowe Street in Ludington, Michigan. It later became better known just as the Haskell canoe. Haskell formed the Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to make boats and canoes. He incorporated it with $100,000 in 1917. The Haskell Boat Company made 600 Haskell canoes in the first year.|$|E
50|$|From {{this period}} {{increased}} {{knowledge and understanding}} of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues</b> saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat aft sections. Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some self draining capabilities with transom flaps, venturi floor drains built in tanks, especially forward and false floors.|$|R
2500|$|The fuselage, {{like most}} of the Kittiwake was built with Saunders' patent Consuta method for {{jointing}} plywood panels with sewn copper wire. [...] This was well tested on motor boats - it circumvented the absence of <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues</b> pre-1945 - but had only been used once before on an aircraft, Saunders' own, much smaller [...] T.1. The hull was of two step design with a shallow V planing bottom and tumblehome sides. [...] On its top were two accommodation levels, the lower glazed in cockpit for the two crew and above them, set back and roofed by the upper wing was the passenger space. [...] This had its own enclosing front and side windows and held seven passengers. [...] Though the forward part of the fuselage containing crew and passengers was married to the hull, aft of the wings these became separate, so that the Kittiwake was somewhere between a flying boat and a single float seaplane in appearance. [...] This separation made it straightforward to mount the tail high up and well clear of the water. [...] There was a variable-incidence tailplane with unbalanced elevators and bearing three wire braced fins, the central one carrying a balanced rudder.|$|R

50|$|The {{character}} of Gilligan is noted for physical comedy, often {{with his friend}} the Skipper {{in the role of}} a straight man. Continuing gags of the show include Gilligan's seduction by Ginger, eating Mary Ann's coconut cream pies, joking about the Skipper's weight, and inadvertently undermining any attempts and efforts of the castaways to get off the island. He often interjected discussions with pointless anecdotes about his childhood or with seemingly useless advice. Though he was often chided by the Skipper for interrupting, on more than one occasion, Gilligan's seemingly random nonsense actually triggered the Professor to remember a useful fact or suggest a course of action. In some episodes, he attempts to make an important suggestion, but is interrupted by the Skipper or another castaway, who tells him to be quiet until the discussion is practically over, when he is able to tell them. Examples of this include the episode where he discovered <b>waterproof</b> <b>glue</b> {{that turned out to be}} temporary and that the ship will sink. His warning was ignored until the point when the boat's boards came undone. Another time when a butterfly collector came to the island and refused to signal until he got what he came for, the castaways are arguing amongst themselves about the collector's recalcitrance and ignoring Gilligan, until he gets in the last word by saying he stole the man's flare gun.|$|E

50|$|Plywood is {{especially}} popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using <b>waterproof</b> <b>glues</b> and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids {{in the interior}} layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil {{should not be used}} on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe)caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as mahogany, okoumé, iroko, Keruing, azobé and merbau. are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed FSC-certified. Teak or iroko is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. Glue, screws, rivets and/or nails are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.|$|R
