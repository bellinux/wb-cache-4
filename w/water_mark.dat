5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{winds of}} tropical storm force along the South Carolina coastline; the highest official wind gust was 51mph (82km/h) at Edisto Beach. The storm dropped precipitation {{across much of}} the state, including a state maximum of 4.42inches (112mm) at Pritchardville. Storm tides reached 7.81feet (2.4m) above the mean low-level <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in the process of becoming extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0; a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes may have occurred in the state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high <b>water</b> <b>mark.</b> Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>marking</b> {{is the art}} {{of hiding}} the fact that {{communication}} is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exist a large variety of invisible <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image <b>water</b> <b>marking,</b> its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good invisible <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> algorithm and briefly reflects on which <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> techniques are more suitable for which applications.

In this {{area of research}} various authors used feature extraction technique such as wavelet transform function and for classification purpose used support vector machine. {{in the process of}} feature based <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> technique feature extraction is most important part and the classification depends on selected feature. In this paper proposed novel digital <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> technique based on integer wavelet transform with attribute based classification technique. For the selection of feature attribute used RBF function. The selection of attribute depends on extracted feature by integer wavelet transform. The proposed method simulates in MATLAB software and tested some reputed attack such as noise attack, share attack and translation attack. our empirical evaluation result shows better performance in compression of DWT <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> technique...|$|R

In coming to its conclusion, the Court defined what {{constituted}} the bed and bank of a river. The case has had international repercussions as well.

The 1893 Brisbane flood ripped Paluma from her moorings and left her well above the high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> in the nearby botanical gardens. As locals considered how to return her to the Brisbane River, another major flood two weeks later refloated the gunboat, and she was pulled clear without any significant damage. The depression of the 1890s saw Paluma and her sister placed in reserve, being reactivated for annual training at Easter. In 1895, she was returned to the Queensland Government.|$|E

25|$|For 400 years Maryland and Virginia have disputed {{control of}} the Potomac and its North Branch, since both states' {{original}} colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers. In its first state constitution adopted in 1776, Virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it, an act disputed by Maryland. Both states acceded to the Compact of 1785 and the 1877 Black-Jenkins Award which grants Maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> on the Virginia side, while permitting Virginia full riparian rights short of obstructing navigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{itself was}} assigned to VIII Corps, and spread out along the southern coast of Cornwall and Devon. The Dorset County Division was based {{to the east of}} the division, and the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division had been placed in reserve behind both formations. The 203rd Brigade was positioned on the western flank of the division's assigned area, and the 209th Brigade on the eastern. The battalions were spread out defending various potential landing areas and other important locations. The coastal defensive positions the division occupied included tubular scaffolding obstacles on the high <b>water</b> <b>mark,</b> barbed wire, minefields, beach front defensive fighting positions equipped with a range of modern and antiquated weaponry such as Maxim machine guns.|$|E

25|$|Milne {{took the}} {{leadership}} {{at a time}} when the Greens nationally had passed a peak. In the 18 months between the high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> of the 2010 Federal Election and Brown's retirement, polls nationally were trending downwards. This was reflected in a number of setbacks for state and local Greens parties, which some commentators blamed on Brown's absence. The outcome of 20 October 2012 election in the ACT resulted in a reduction of Greens Legislative Assembly members, from four to one. The Western Australian state election was held in March 2013. For the Legislative Assembly, the total primary vote for the Greens fell by 3.52% to 8.40%. In the Legislative Council the Greens' representation was reduced from four to two members.|$|E
25|$|If a river, {{subject to}} tides, {{constituted}} {{the boundary of}} a State, and at flood {{the waters of the}} river flowed through a narrow channel, round an extensive body of land, but receded from that channel at ebb, so as to leave the land it surrounded at high water, connected with {{the main body of the}} country; this portion of territory would scarcely be considered as belonging to the State on the opposite side of the river, although that State should have the property of the river. The principle that a country bounded by a river extends to low <b>water</b> <b>mark,</b> a principle so natural, and of such obvious convenience as to have been generally adopted, would, we think, apply to that case. We perceive no sufficient reason why it should not apply to this.|$|E
