40|$|The Penrice Quarry in South Australia mines {{chemically}} pure marble {{for use in}} the chemical industry. The Quarry's major customer is the Penrice Soda Products plant at Osborne, S. A., where 508, 000 tonnes of high grade marble are used per annum. The marble is burnt in vertical shaft kilns (calcining) as part of the Solvay Process for soda ash (sodium carbonate) manufacture. Since early 1993 the kilns operations have been plagued by elevated kiln pressures coupled with the production of undesirable wastes called 'grits' (i. e. fine grained, partly calcined marble). These undesirable operating parameters and end products create limitations within the kilns plant and ultimately affect the down stream production of soda ash. It is known that the Penrice marble, although {{chemically pure}}, does not always behave ideally during calcining as it often has a tendency to disintegrate in the kilns. This disintegration, termed 'decrepitation', generates excessive amounts of granular material that interferes with the airflow updraft in the kilns. This results in elevated kiln pressures, increases in 'grits' production and difficulties in controlling other operating parameters. Given these criteria, it was apparent that this decrepitation had been the major contributor to these poor kilns performances since early 1993. Consequently, it was decided that a series of new investigations needed to be undertaken to determine: i. The major cause(s) at the quarry of potentially decrepitating marble given that the kilns operations are essentially constant, ii. Why the levels of decrepitation have increased, and iii What changes could be made to current quarry practices to prevent or at least minimise the occurrence of decrepitating marble. These investigations commenced with a break down of the current mining practices at the quarry which indicated that the most significant change to occur was the introduction of new production scheduling procedures (i. e. in-pit blending). Production records showed that since the introduction of these new scheduling procedures a significant proportion of marble for the Osborne plant was sourced from the lower benches in the northern end of the pit. Historically this marble was considered to be of unsuitable grade for the Osborne plant and as such almost all Osborne marble was sourced from {{the southern end of the}} pit. Further investigations indicated that the major difference between the southern and northern ends of the pit was that much of the mining in the northern end of the pit was below the water table and necessitated the use of waterproof explosives (i. e. Handibullc Wet*). For this reason it was decided to engage ICI Explosives to undertake some trial blasts and subsequent photogrammetric analyses to determine the differences between wet and dry blasts and the influence they had on the production of potentially decrepitating marble. The trials showed that both wet and dry hole blasts produced structurally weak marble around the explosive column in the blastholes, which was subsequently termed 'blast affected marble'. The main finding of the blasting trials was that <b>wet</b> <b>hole</b> blasting (Handibulk Wet) produced 6. 6 per cent blast affected marble while dry hole blasting (ANFO) produced only 1. 5 per cent. These results suggested that the increase in decrepitation and therefore poor kiln performances were linked to an increase in the utilisation of low strength (i. e. blast affected) marble as a result of increased <b>wet</b> <b>hole</b> blasting. Petrographic analyses were undertaken by the author in an effort to understand the nature and intensity of the fracture systems produced via blasting and how those findings could be related to blasting practices. Some point load strength tests were also conducted in order to gain an appreciation of the degree of strength loss produced between heavily blast affected marble and marble unaffected by blasting. Blend changes incorporating less marble from the northern end of the pit have helped to alleviate the problem while further work is continuing into alternative explosive types and dewatering methods within the lower benches of the pit to enable ANFO type explosives to be used...|$|E

Proper completion of a well is essential to the protection of ground-water resources. Selecting a proper material for the annular seal should be based on the geologic conditions at the well site. Previous studies have not adequately linked annular seal material selection with geologic variability. This study created unique geological-based criteria for the selection of annular seal materials. The shear strength with which the annular seal materials held the PVC well pipe was tested, as were the expansive properties of annular seal materials. Both bentonite and cement seals were tested. Unidirectional swell and reserve expansion of bentonite was also examined. Bentonite pellets were found to have a greater reserve (potential) expansion than bentonite chips. However, when emplaced dry and subsequently hydrated, bentonite chips showed greater unidirectional expansion than pellets, because the slaking of pellets caused them to quickly fall apart and seal the remaining bentonite from the water supply. When emplaced through a standing column of water, pellets showed greater unidirectional expansion, because they adhered to the sides of the container, ensuring a larger volume of water to a greater surface area of bentonite. Pumpable bentonite grouts were found to have shear strengths of 0. I psi or lower. Chips were found to have strengths of approximately 0. 7 psi and pellets around 2 psi. However, when pellets were emplaced through water, they achieved shear strengths of only 0. 8 psi. All bentonite samples had good recoverability. Cement-based samples had initial shear strengths of 4. 7 psi or greater. After failure these values dropped significantly, they are therefore considered to have poor recoverability. 'Me performance of various annular seal materials was related to rock strength, hole condition, and hydrologic condition to devise a material selection technique. Pumpable grouts are best suited for pressurized (artesian) well conditions because their weight counters the upward pressure of water; semi-rigid bentonite seals (chips and pellets) are best suited for <b>wet</b> <b>hole</b> conditions because when hydrated these materials form a low permeability seal with moderately high shear strength; and cement base seals are best suited for dry strong rock environments...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} sharp {{interface}} model for simulating solid-state dewetting where the surface energy is (weakly) anisotropic. The morphology evolution of thin films {{is governed by}} surface diffusion and contact line migration. The mathematical model {{is based on an}} energy variational approach. Anisotropic surface energies lead to multiple solutions of the contact angle equation at contact points. Introduction of a finite contact point mobility is both physically based and leads to robust, unambiguous determination of the contact angles. We implement the mathematical model in an explicit finite difference scheme with cubic spline interpolation for evolving marker points. Following validation of the mathematical and numerical approaches, we simulate the evolution of thin film islands, semi-infinite films, and films with holes as a function of film dimensions, Young's angle θ_i, anisotropy strength and crystal symmetry, and film crystal orientation relative to the substrate normal. We find that the contact point retraction rate can be well described by a power-law, l ∼ t^n. Our results demonstrate that the exponent n is not universal [...] it is sensitive to the Young's angle θ_i (and insensitive to anisotropy). In addition to classical <b>wetting</b> (where <b>holes</b> in a film heal) and dewetting (where holes in a film grow), we observe cases where a hole through the film heals but leave a finite size hole/bubble between the continuous film and substrate or where the hole heals leaving a continuous film that is not bonded to the substrate. Surface energy anisotropy (i) increases the instability that leads to island break-up into multiple islands, (ii) enhances hole healing, and (iii) leads to finite island size even under some conditions where the Young's angle θ_i suggests that the film wets the substrate.

40|$|Sublevel caving {{method is}} {{generally}} selected for large ore bodies with steep slope. This method {{is based on}} the gravity flow of the ore to get better recovery. Due to the continuous caving as the mining goes deeper, fractures of hanging wall occur consequently and thus it collapses into the cave. The local stress field is also affected by various mining activities and it initiates the movement of geological structures in the rock mass and causes seismic event frequently. Thus, it is required to investigate instability problems in various ore bodies in the mine as mining advances deeper and deeper. Investigation of boreholes by filming is a technical way to inspect the overall stability in an ore body. This project work mainly consists of three parts such as Pre-investigation based on production measurement by collecting data from GIRON (Internal production database in LKAB), Field work by filming and Analysis of the data collected from the field. Three ore bodies named Alliansen, Fabian and Vi-Ri were selected for this work. In the pre-investigation, different problems in the borehole are categorized such as re-drilling, <b>wet</b> <b>holes,</b> stones and concrete in the boreholes in different sublevels where the production was completed or about to complete. Re-drilling maps are drawn in different ore bodies as well. The mine co-ordinates of the ring have been used to locate the approximate area of re-drilling. This pre-investigation enabled us to know which areas in the sublevels are more prone to instabilities in different ore bodies. Thus, drifts were selected around this area in the next sublevels or in the same level for filming. These drifts are classified into three criteria; ongoing production, open cut is finished and open cut has not been done. In Alliansen, level 992 m and 1022 m have been selected for field work. In addition, level 855 m and 880 m in Fabian and 1026 m in Vi-Ri are investigated by filming. It was not possible to get sufficient filming from the level 880 m in Fabian and 1022 m in Alliansen {{due to the lack of}} time and instrument problems. The analysis is done based on production records and field work. In the production records, the percentage of re-drilling has increased to 6. 67 % from the level 932 m to 962 m in Alliansen and 3. 72 % from the level 830 m to 855 m in Fabian. Further, the fluctuation of percentage of re-drilling is observed in sublevels in Vi-Ri. Moreover, the percentage of stones found in the boreholes has also increased considerably in different sublevels in this ore body. This analysis is performed based on the total number of holes (which are blasted or charged) in each sublevel. In the field work, a total of 298 boreholes have been analyzed from the collar to the bottom. Typical modes of instability problems such as shearing, cracking, deformation or breakages inside the boreholes are confirmed. In Alliansen, boreholes are sheared off significantly in a certain part in the sublevels. Besides this, in Fabian, boreholes are caved notably in different drifts. In Vi-Ri, boreholes are broken considerably as well. According to the results from filming, borehole instability problems are affected due to the production sequence is analyzed. It is proved that deformation and cracks are most common problems in boreholes around the ring which was blasted last. However, the causes of deformation or cracks are not only the production activities but also the movement of geological structures and fractures of hanging wall due to the continuous cave as the mining progresses downward change local stress field significantly. In Alliansen, geologic structures have been analyzed by considering a common shearing plane which could cross subsequent sublevels. The mine co-ordinates of the borehole where it has been sheared or re-drilled are used to get the co-relations among the sublevels. A statistical regression towards the width of the ore body was sufficient to predict that the same shearing plane are crossing several subsequent sublevels. It is also proved that the area which is influenced by more seismic events is the same as the one where several boreholes were re-drilled or sheared. At last, several causes behind the instability problems are discussed and possible recommendations have been given to ensure a safer environment. Validerat; 20121106 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|Introduction]. Usually, Europe {{is defined}} and {{designed}} along the geography it constitutes {{and the history}} it accrued. The political organization of Europe is related to both of it {{and at the same}} time not free of contradictions with regard to any reasonable meaning of a "European identity". There are more institutions than one, given the existence of the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, and – last but not least - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which institutionalizes the United States of America as a European power. Europe is grappling with its borders towards the East and the South East. Can Russia belong to the core institutions of Europe? Is Turkey a European country? In any case, the discussion is following the primacy of territorial thinking. Europe, that is Europe’s territory and the ambition to link it both with Europe’s past and the future Europe hopes for. But Europe, that is also Europe’s lakes, the seas and waters which are an integral nevertheless peripheral part of Europe’s shape. The Mediterranean and the Black Seas, even the Caspian and certainly the Baltic and the North Sea do impact on Europe’s self-perception and are related to many of the challenges ahead of Europe at the beginning of the twenty-first century. They are no less important than the Atlantic Ocean has unquestionably been for the shaping and the destiny of Europe in the course of the last five hundred years, culminating in the important role the north American democracies have played for Europe during the twentieth century. Intuitively, contemporary Europeans tend to perceive the waters which surround and enclose European territories as borders, as limits and dividing lines. The opposite coast lines constitute "the other", far away and often strange lands. At least they are likely to divide and to constitute black - and <b>wet</b> - <b>holes</b> without meaning and reason. This, however, may very well change in the course of the next years. A Europe which is defining its identity and is shaping its political organizations can no longer overlook the fact that its surrounding waters are an integral part of the shaping and making of the “new Europe“. The lakes of Europe are part of Europe since they constitute bridges rather than barriers. For better or worse, the opposite coast lines are part and parcel of Europe’s future. This seems to be evident in the case of the Atlantic Ocean although transatlantic relations are going through a period of deep redefinition since the binding glue of the common enmities of the Cold War is no more. The Baltic Sea is rediscovering that it is the magnetic force which brings its adjacent nations closer together than ever before since centuries. The Black Sea has only begun to discover the meaning and potential of the very same fact. The North Sea is still defining the global view of countries such as Iceland and Norway, while the Caspian Sea is being reinvented as a function of its sea-bed and the surrounding oil and gas fields...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions are powerful, {{uncontrollable}} natural {{events which}} produce {{a number of}} hazards that can impact upon all aspects of society, including critical infrastructure. The most widespread and disruptive of these hazards is volcanic ashfall. Direct ashfall impacts, even minor, can cause multiple knock on effects throughout all critical infrastructure sectors leading to disruption of these services, on which society relies. However with appropriate volcanic risk management strategies, these impacts can be lessened. Electronic equipment, including laptop computers, are a common and vital component in all critical infrastructure sectors, field based volcanic research and wider society. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how laptops will function in volcanic environments. This thesis assesses the vulnerability of laptop computers to volcanic ash and gas hazards through field and laboratory based experimentation and the development of quantitative risk assessments metrics. Laboratory based ash vulnerability experiments were carried out in the Volcanic Ash Testing Facility, University of Canterbury, using a mass produced basalt ‘pseudo ash’, which is physically and chemically analogous to fresh volcanic ash. Each laptop was exposed to ash for 100 160 hours at fall rates of ~ 500 g/m² h. None of the ten laptops used sustained any permanent damage from volcanic ash, however, three shutdown temporarily due to overheating. This was because laptops only contain a few small ventilation holes which prevent large quantities of ash from entering the laptops. However, ash contamination reduced functionality of keyboards, CD drives and some cooling fans as these are open to the environment or located close to ventilation <b>holes.</b> <b>Wet</b> ash, known to cause short circuits of electrical equipment, was not able to enter the laptops because it is less mobile than dry ash. Functionality was retained with the use of simple mitigation techniques such as placing laptops inside heavy duty polyethylene bags. Volcanic gas vulnerability experiments were undertaken at White Island, New Zealand. Three laptops were exposed to high concentrations of volcanic gases for ~ 5 hours. None however, sustained any permanent damage, due to the limited quantity of gas that could enter the laptop, although metal components on the outside of the laptop sustained minor corrosion...|$|R
