5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, India's growth reached 7.5%, which <b>will</b> <b>double</b> {{the average income}} in a decade. Analysts say that if India pushed more {{fundamental}} market reforms, it could sustain the rate and even reach the government's 2011 target of 10%. States have large responsibilities over their economies. The average annual growth rates (2007-12) for Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam (5.88%). India is the sixth-largest {{economy in the world}} and the third largest by purchasing power parity adjusted exchange rates (PPP). On per capita basis, it ranks 140th in the world or 129th by PPP.|$|E

25|$|The Goldman Sachs global {{economics}} team {{released a}} follow-up report to its initial BRIC study in 2004. The report states that in BRIC nations, {{the number of}} people with an annual income over a threshold of $3,000 <b>will</b> <b>double</b> in number within three years and reach 800 million people within a decade. This predicts a massive rise {{in the size of the}} middle class in these nations. In 2025, it is calculated that {{the number of people}} in BRIC nations earning over $15,000 may reach over 200 million people. This indicates that a huge pickup in demand will not be restricted to basic goods but impact higher-priced goods as well. According to the report, first China and then a decade later India will begin to dominate the world economy.|$|E
500|$|Commercial-grade {{tellurium}} {{is usually}} marketed as 200-mesh powder {{but is also}} available as slabs, ingots, sticks, or lumps. The year-end price for tellurium in 2000 was US$14 per pound. In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as US$100 per pound in 2006. [...] Despite the expectation that improved production methods <b>will</b> <b>double</b> production, the United States Department of Energy (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} awarded points for {{correctly}} hitting notes, chords and sustains. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing {{a series of}} consecutive notes successfully. A [...] "Rock Meter" [...] tracks the player's performance based on {{success or failure of}} hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn [...] "Star Power" [...] by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power <b>will</b> <b>double</b> the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes. Thus, players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed.|$|E
