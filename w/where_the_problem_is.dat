25|$|According to Fisher (1970), {{there are}} four phases of decision-making: orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. As a {{communicative}} approach, the orientation stage is where the members involved are becoming acquainted both with themselves {{as well as the}} problem at hand. The conflict stage is <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> analyzed with several possibilities presented to resolve the problem. Upon discussing these possibilities, the emergence phase becomes known when a decision is made about which solution is to be used. The reinforcement stage is the supportive of the decision. These phases are not without objection from many theorists in the field. Morley and Stephenson (1977) claim that such a staged model of decision-making is not so rigid between phases and varies depending upon the types of decisions made.|$|E

2500|$|From {{this the}} basic {{ventricular}} [...] "on demand" [...] pacing mode is VVI or with automatic rate adjustment for exercise VVIR – this mode is suitable when no synchronization with the atrial beat is required, as in atrial fibrillation. The equivalent atrial pacing mode is AAI or AAIR {{which is the}} mode of choice when atrioventricular conduction is intact but the natural pacemaker the sinoatrial node is unreliable – sinus node disease (SND) or sick sinus syndrome. <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> atrioventricular block (AVB) the pacemaker is required to detect (sense) the atrial beat and after a normal delay (0.1–0.2 seconds) trigger a ventricular beat, unless it has already happened – this is VDD mode and can be achieved with a single pacing lead with electrodes in the right atrium (to sense) and ventricle (to sense and pace). These modes AAIR and VDD are unusual in the US but widely used in Latin America and Europe. The DDDR mode is most commonly used as it covers all the options though the pacemakers require separate atrial and ventricular leads and are more complex, requiring careful programming of their functions for optimal results.|$|E
