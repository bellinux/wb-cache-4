25|$|In {{mathematical}} statistics, the Kullback–Leibler divergence (also called relative entropy) is {{a measure}} of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. Applications include characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference. In contrast to variation of information, it is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure and thus does not qualify as a statistical metric of spread. In the simple case, a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 0 indicates that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> similar, if not the same, behavior of two different distributions, while a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 1 indicates that the two distributions behave in such a different manner that the expectation given the first distribution approaches zero. In simplified terms, it {{is a measure}} of surprise, with diverse applications such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and machine learning.|$|E

Under carefully controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, pressure and so on the same gun is fired repeatedly and speed measurements taken. This produces some distribution of speeds.

[...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate.
