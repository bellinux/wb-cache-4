500|$|The {{performances}} of Amelia Bullmore and Nicola Walker in the Series 3 finale were highly praised. Julia Raeside of The Guardian commented that both [...] "give an incredible acting masterclass that <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away. Truly gripping and the jewel in ITV's increasingly impressive drama crown. Splendid stuff." [...] The series {{was nominated for}} the BAFTA TV award for Best Drama Series in both 2012 and 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{positive}} reaction by critics. Gaffa Norway critic Tord Litleskare considered it [...] "the most positive song from Truth Serum with its strong chorus and subdued verses". Additionally, he called it a [...] "must-hear track" [...] alongside [...] "Habits" [...] and [...] "Not On Drugs". Richard S. Chang of Redbull.com ranked it at number 3 on his Top 5 Best Tove Lo songs list and wrote that [...] "'Out Of Mind' provides the blueprint for Tove Lo's hits: soft and spare verse, followed by an explosive chorus â€” all fitting in nicely at just over three minutes". Under the Gun Review's Tarynn Law called it a [...] "powerful shadow pop track" [...] that [...] "shows off [...] outstanding vocals and just how much promise she has". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that the pre-chorus of the song was [...] "a moment on [...] that <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away". Idolator critic Sam Lansky called it [...] "a cinematic anthem, perfectly suited for some big heartbreak montage, with a big, gorgeous stampeding chorus that crashes in out of nowhere". He also noted that, with the song, the singer positions as [...] "the next great Swedish pop act".|$|E
2500|$|Cook {{finished}} his review by saying, [...] "I promise. This music <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away". The album was ranked at No. 11 in the NME top [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] for 1982, with [...] "Slowdive" [...] {{ranked among the}} year's top 50 tracks.|$|E

2500|$|The Banshees {{followed}} in 1982 with the psychedelic A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The record, featuring strings on several numbers, was an intentional contrast to their previous work, with Severin later describing it as a [...] "sexy album". The British press greeted it enthusiastically. Richard Cook finished his NME review with this sentence: [...] "I promise...this music <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away". At that time, McGeoch {{was struggling with}} alcohol problems, and was hospitalised on his return to a promotional trip from Madrid. The band fired him shortly thereafter. Severin asked Robert Smith to take over guitarist duties again; Smith accepted and rejoined the group in November 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Justin Leeper {{scored the}} Xbox version 9.25 out of 10, calling it [...] "a {{tremendous}} game [...] the graphics are outstanding, and the seamless integration between real-time and FMV cutscenes <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away." [...] GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald scored both the Xbox and the GameCube versions 8 out of 10, calling it [...] "a traditional hack-and-slash action game that features great gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, {{and lots of}} extras." [...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not {{really one of the}} better action games around. It does nothing new {{and there are a lot}} of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming reticule for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections. Well, don't bet on it, Bilbo. There are absolutely no differences between this, the GameCube, and the PlayStation 2 versions." ...|$|E
