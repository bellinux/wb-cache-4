500|$|Saturation diving lets {{professional}} divers {{live and}} work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers {{on the deck of}} a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are [...] transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed diving bell. Decompression {{at the end of the}} dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater <b>work</b> <b>efficiency</b> and safety.|$|E

The shares of variable and fixed costs in total production costs were determined 40. 10 % and 59. 90 %, respectively. Land hire had 24. 70 % as the highest share in fixed costs while the highest share for variable costs were observed in fertilization (10. 30 %) and spraying (7. 00 %). The highest and the lowest unit of labour requirements (units of human labour power, h ha– 1) were obtained for harvesting processes (4. 28 h ha- 1) and spraying (2. 35 h ha- 1), respectively.

Necessary operation conditions for the heat machine to perform as an engine or a refrigerator are derived. We relate the <b>work</b> and <b>efficiency</b> of the device to local and non-local statistical properties of the baths (purity, mutual coincidence etc.). In particular, we relate the Clausius inequality to the symmetrized relative entropy of the baths (Jefferys divergence). Other Clausius-like inequalities are derived as well.
