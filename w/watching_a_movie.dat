25|$|According to {{the initial}} {{investigation}} conducted by the Philippine Coast Guard, only one apprentice {{member of the crew}} of the Doña Paz was monitoring the bridge when the accident occurred. Other officers were either drinking beer or watching television in the crew's recreation quarters, while the ship's captain was <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> on his Betamax in his cabin. Nonetheless, subsequent inquiries revealed that the Vector was operating without a license, lookout or properly qualified master. The Board of Marine Inquiry eventually cleared Sulpicio Lines of fault in the accident. In 1999, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that it was the owners of the Vector who were liable to indemnify the victims of the collision. Some of the claims pursued against either Sulpicio Lines or the owners of the Vector, such as those filed by the Cañezal family (who lost two members) and the Macasas family (who lost three members) were adjudicated by the Supreme Court, which found that even the families of victims who did not appear on the official manifest were entitled to indemnity. Caltex Philippines, which had chartered the Vector, was likewise cleared of financial liability.|$|E

500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurrence supporting the majority decision, and {{was joined by}} Chief Justice John G. Roberts. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its [...] "threshold requirement" [...] that guides what material would {{be covered by the}} law was too broad, he questioned the potential double standard that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold. Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that [...] "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> or a television show," [...] referencing the book [...] Infinite Reality [...] which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision [...] "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem." ...|$|E
500|$|Residente {{described}} the album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor. [...] With the lyrics on the record, Residente aimed for authenticity, attempting to tackle subjects not typically discussed in conventional reggaeton. [...] He explained that listening to Residente o Visitante {{is similar to}} <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> {{in the sense that}} the album depicts real life events and uses profanity to evoke emotion in the listener. [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard wrote that the lyrical content of Residente o Visitante ranges from [...] "sophomoric humor to outright perversion". [...] The song [...] "Mala Suerte Con el 13", the group's collaboration with La Mala Rodriguez, is a satire of the [...] "Latin macho attitude". [...] He wished to defy and poke fun at traditional gender roles, citing feminist philosopher Judith Butler as an influence; [...] "I wanted to record a duet between a guy who's weak and inadequate, and a woman who's a sexual psychopath and has all the power in the world. A complete mockery of macho stereotypes". [...] In the same vein, [...] "Sin Exagerar" [...] parodies the misogyny that Residente felt had saturated the reggaeton scene.|$|E

500|$|The Smith {{family have}} dinner together, and Stan {{talks about the}} events that {{occurred}} on a documentary on animals that aired earlier.

Stan later becomes insecure about the incident, and he is afraid that his stance as the alpha male of the household will be dethroned. The next morning, when Steve is <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> on television, Stan abruptly pushes him off the couch and claims it as his [...] "territory" [...] by peeing all over it. Steve becomes furious, and he tells Francine about the situation in the kitchen. Francine tells him that Stan is intimidated by him, and that he feels that he will be dethroned of his dominance by him. Puzzled, Steve talks to Stan about the issue and openly challenges him of his position as the dominant person in the household. Though Steve manages to outdo him in everything, Stan is inspired by a walrus documentary to do the one thing his son can not do: have sex. Turning to Roger for help, Steve is suggested to go to a party to get laid. Informed by Klaus of this, Stan rushes to the party to stop his son. However, upon arriving there, Stan learns that Steve's various attempts to have sex with a girl failed miserably as the boy is having a mental breakdown. Roger explains now there's no threat to Steve challenging Stan, and no threat of Steve's future son (whom shall never be born) challenging him. Stan later apologizes to him, and admits to having failed to raise him to be a man.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{who were}} {{generally}} less positive in their opinions of Tangled {{and its main}} characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were otherwise impressed by Pascal and Maximus' performances.

Similarly, Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This ride's a familiar one, but with humourous (sic) sidekicks such as horse-who-thinks-he's-a-dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal, it's thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled, he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film's [...] "Most Memorable Cliché", writing that the characters [...] "are better than the movie deserves." [...] White continued, [...] "they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat-like main characters", concluding, [...] "I kept wishing I was <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about just them." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn, who was ambivalent towards the film, admitted that Pascal and Maximus [...] "provide some chuckles." [...] Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote, [...] "With two such bland heroes, it's good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters, notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse", while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus [...] "a more complex, multi-dimensional character than some movies' leads". Despite calling the film [...] "bland", the Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli called Maximus a [...] "stone cool" [...] character. Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly, however, praised the entire ensemble as a whole, calling Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable quartet."
