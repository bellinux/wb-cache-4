5|$|Michael J. Flynn created {{one of the}} {{earliest}} classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy.

5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations <b>were</b> <b>operating,</b> with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E

Surface gold was discovered in the area in 1891, and within three years more than 150 mines <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Because the minelayers <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> {{within range}} of German surface raiders, the American battleships were {{detailed}} to provide an escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, North Korean troops <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> in the {{mountains}} west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. U.S. Air Force commanders—wary of enemy attack—evacuated the 45 P-51s of the 39th and 40th Fighter Squadron from the airstrip, against complaints of General MacArthur. However, the airstrip remained {{under the protection of}} UN ground forces and never came under direct North Korean fire. The squadrons were moved to Tsuiki on the island of Kyushu, Japan.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} fuel flow disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful attempts by the crew to restore proper fuel flow and engine operation. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|In 1469 Shetland {{came under}} nominal Scottish control, {{although}} the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> a summer trading booth to buy {{fish from the}} local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens.|$|E

The Temple's members come {{from a variety of}} racial backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> in Afghanistan, {{transporting}} {{troops and}} supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in federal funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 9, the IAF {{aircraft}} over Lebanon <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> at three levels. Kfirs and Skyhawks were along the coastline from Sidon {{to the outskirts of}} Beirut, providing close air support for the ground troops and striking at Palestine Liberation Organization targets. At the second level, over 10,000 feet (3,000 m), similar formations were circling and awaiting orders. At the top level, Hawkeyes were stationed to ensure air control. The first task force aircraft attacked the Syrian radar at the top of Jebel Baruk, which was commanding a large area.|$|E
5|$|Otranto {{accompanied}} Cradock {{and three}} cruisers {{to patrol the}} Strait of Magellan and the Chilean coast for German ships in mid-September. They failed to locate any of the German ships, but Otranto intercepted messages that indicated that German warships <b>were</b> <b>operating</b> in the area. Cradock concentrated his ships on the southwestern coast of South America in mid-October to prevent the East Asia Squadron under Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee from breaking through into the South Atlantic. In mid-October Otranto struck a rock while departing Port Legunas, Chile, but a diver from Monmouth reported that it had done very little damage.|$|E
