40|$|Abstract. Waterjet {{generated}} surfaces {{consist of}} two different zones, which {{are a result of}} different erosion mechanisms. The upper region is called as the cutting <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> which is a rather smooth surface compared to the lower region, the deformation <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> which has frequent striations and lots of irregularities due to weakened abrasive waterjet (AWJ) penetration. For most of ceramic works, smooth surfaces are needed in the market. In this study, two types of commercial ceramics and marble were used in order to investigate to effects of AWJ parameters, such as pressure, traverse rate, abrasive flow rate and on the cutting <b>wear</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental study {{to describe a}} <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> in the P 40 cutting tools used during a dry lathing. Mechanics of cutting has been presented to investigate the effects of edge geometry of the cutting tool carbide cutting insert. In the field of the metals cutting, the wear of the cutting tools leads to a degradation of the cutting zone and work. It is thus important to study {{the evolution of the}} cutting criteria allowing to follow the tool degradation during a manufacturing operations and thus to decide whether to replace the tool or not. Three parameters: cutting speed, cutting feed and cutting depth are considered to modelize the tool wear. An experimental device, particularly, a work-piece in Fk 20 MnCr 5 material was cutted on a conventional lath for shaping, a high resolution sensor (HRS), had been used for measuring <b>wear</b> <b>zone.</b> The rela- tionship between “the cutting speed, the depth of cut, the feed rate” are analysed and modelled. In order to deduce this shape the spline method to modelize the <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> has been used and a mathematical model has been proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the area}} of grit blasting, {{it is well known}} that microscopically small {{abrasive}} debris gets trapped on the surface, and due to impact the grits might cause the surface to fracture and a fraction of it to be embedded. The same problem appears in abrasive water jet (AWJ) machining especially in the so-called deformation <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> or striation zone. The major aim in this study is to investigate the abrasive contamination on mild steel cutting surface. In the present study mild steel was used as the work material, since it is widely used in many industries. In order to analyze the pattern of the contaminations on the cut surface, the selected process parameters were abrasive flow rate, pressure and work feed rate. Abrasive contamination was measured at different depths along the path of the abrasives. The three selected zones for measuring abrasive contamination at different depths were the primary impact zone, the smoother zone and the deformation <b>wear</b> <b>zone.</b> It was found that contamination at the middle zone, i. e., the smoother zone had the least abrasive contamination while the initial impact zone and the deformation <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> showed high abrasive contamination. It was also found that a higher pressure reduces abrasive contamination while a higher abrasive flow rate and work feed rate increase abrasive contamination...|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of movement by railway vehicles creates {{a problem that}} {{is connected to the}} wear process for elements of a tribological wheel–rail system. Wheel–rail wear is a complex phenomenon that depends on many factors. One of the main <b>wear</b> <b>zones</b> is the contact area between a wheel flange and a rail gauge. As is well known, wear in this contact zone occurs when a railway vehicle moves on curved parts of track, realizes tractive, braking efforts or moves in a high-speed mode. In this case, the solution of this kind of wear problem can be found by means of lubricant implementation. The choice of a lubricant requires information about contact characteristics at the moment of a vehicle’s movement. This paper focuses on the modeling of the temperature process in the contact between a wheel flange and a rail gauge. Examples of temperature calculation with some experimental data as input for this computation are presented. The obtained values of the temperature allow for making the correct choice of lubricant type...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{principle}} {{purpose of}} this investigation is to recognize the wear phenomenon of the mixed ceramic tips against 60 HRC alloy steel specimens in dry and hard turning operations. This knowledge allows optimal machining chains to be planned by the manufacturing engineers. Design/methodology/approach: Light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BSE technique and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRM) were applied for observations of worn tool surfaces, wear products and the distinction of wear mechanisms occurring. Findings: It was found that wear mechanisms observed in the machining tests involve abrasion, fracture, plastic flow, material transfer and tribochemical effects which appear depending on the mechanical and thermal conditions generated on the <b>wear</b> <b>zones.</b> Research limitations/implications: Investigations were performed under varying feed rate, constant cutting speed of 100 m/min and small depth of cut of 0. 2 mm to perform finishing cuts. Practical implications: In this study both microscopic and microstructural aspects of ceramic tool wear were taken into consideration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the critical wear levels of the contact wire of the catenary on metropolitan lines. The study has focussed on the zones of contact wire where localised wear is produced, normally associated with the appearance of electric arcs. To this end, a finite element model has been developed to study the dynamics of pantograph-catenary interaction. The model includes a zone of localised wear and a singularity in the contact wire in order to simulate the worst case scenario from the point of view of stresses. 	In order to consider the different stages in the wire wear process, different depths and widths of the localised <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> were defined. The results of the dynamic simulations performed for each stage of wear let the area of the minimum resistant section of the contact wire be determined for which stresses are greater than the allowable stress. 	The maximum tensile stress reached in the contact wire shows a clear sensitivity to the size of the local <b>wear</b> <b>zone,</b> defined by its width and depth. In this way, if the wear measurements taken with an overhead line recording vehicle are analysed, it will be possible to calculate the potential breakage risk of the wire. A strong dependence of the tensile forces of the contact wire has also been observed. These results will allow priorities to be set for replacing the most critical sections of wire, thereby making maintenance much more efficient. The results obtained show that the wire replacement criteria currently borne in mind have turned out to be appropriate, although in some wear scenarios these criteria could be adjusted even more, and so prolong the life cycle of the contact wire...|$|E

To achieve this, special thin film sensors for temperature, wear and tool breakage measurement were integrated into the hard coating system of cutting inserts. The electrical power supply of the sensors and the transfer of the signals were performed by use of telemtric MST techniques.

40|$|To {{assess how}} tooth {{microstructure}} and composition might facilitate the pharyngeal mill mechanism of halfbeaks, apatite structure and iron content {{were determined by}} scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis for Hyporhamphus regularis ardelio, Arrhamphus sclerolepis krefftii, and Hemiramphus robustus. Iron was present in developing teeth and was concentrated along the shearing edge of spatulate incisiform teeth, which dominate the occlusive <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> in all three species. A model based on tooth structure and wear rate is proposed to explain how halfbeaks maintain a fully functional occlusion zone throughout growth and consequent tooth addition and replacement. Replacement teeth erupt and wear rapidly so that a constant occlusion plane is always present.

Until now, {{little is known}} about the integrity loss of protective coatings for these applications. Gaining knowledge of fundamental mechanisms on the functional degradation of protective coatings is of great interest. The work presented in this paper investigates compositional changes in the surface-near region of precious metal PVD-coatings after being annealed in hot glass contact. Different characteristic <b>wear</b> <b>zones</b> identified on the samples have been analyzed by light microscopy, SEM/EDX, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results are compared to the wear stages observed on molds used in industrial production. A qualitative model for the degradation of the substrate-coating system is proposed, ranging from the initial phases of material alteration to the final coating breakdown. In addition, indications that glass components might play a role in the overall degradation process were found but could not be revealed in detail. With regards to highly precise molding tools for PGM, further work should be focused on the initial phase of wear, since the end of service life time is reached at early degradation stages, far before the coating flake-off...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{wear rate}} of {{a cutting tool}} mainly affects its life. So it is {{important}} for tool manufacturers to think about different techniques to reduce tool wear rate, which in turn helps to increase its life span. This paper proposes an efficient design of an array of micro grooves useful for the deposition of alternate hard and soft nanocoatings which will help to characterize and analyze <b>wear</b> <b>zones</b> of WC inserts. The proposed design of the grooves on tool inserts helps to deposit various nanocoatings which act as a lubricating medium and helps the tool to reduce friction and wear. Grooves were designed based on the chip flow path. Electro discharge machining (EDM) was used for the formation of grooves on the rake face of WC inserts. The authors made an attempt to design efficient and generalized groove pattern to deposit hard and soft alternative nanocoatings on the rake face of the cutting tool. Authors are also suggested that the method proposed in this paper can concentrate on the identified zones instead of depositing the nanocoatings over the entire rake face. This in turn reduces the wastage of Nanomaterial deposited on the tool and also makes optimum rake face utilization. PVD technique is used to deposit alternate soft and hard nanocoatings in the grooves...|$|R

Dual mobility, a THA (total hip arthroplasty) concept where the liner moves inside the metallic shell, has become popular due to its low dislocation rate. To understand the tribological behavior of this particular implant, especially the role of the second mobility, 12 representative explants were selected from a bank of 250 explants. The implants used were Profil® femoral stem and Novae® metallic shell.

40|$|This paper aims to {{characterize}} the surface damage {{as a consequence of}} fretting fatigue in aluminum alloy 7075 -T 6 plates in double-lap bolted joints through XRD, surface profilometry, and SEM analyses. The main focus was on the surface roughness and chemical phase composition of the damaged zone along with the identification of fretting fatigue crack initiations over the surface of the material. The surface roughness of the fretted zone was found to increase when the joint was clamped with a higher tightening torque and tested under the same cyclic loading. Additionally, MgZn 2 (η/ή) precipitates and ZnO phase were found to form onto the surface of uncoated aluminum plate in the fretted and <b>worn</b> <b>zones.</b> The formation of the ZnO phase was understood to be a result of frictional heat induced between the surface of contacting uncoated Al 7075 -T 6 plates during cyclic loading and exposure to the air.

Not all the work-piece but just the <b>worn</b> <b>zones</b> are subjected to recovery with electric contact surfacing; the tape thickness and depth of the heat affected zone being not more than a few millimeters.

40|$|Although {{extensive}} {{research has been}} undertaken on wear of alumina there is still poor understanding about the mechanisms which can take place during the ill vivo wear of alumina, such as found in alumina hip prostheses. In particular, the origin of 'stripe' wear, a region of high wear dominated by fracture that is observed widely from retrieved ill vivo alumina hip prostheses, has not been clearly determined. Moreover, {{it has not been}} completely validated that laboratory hip simulators reproduce the same wear mechanisms as found in the body, although it is known that the stripe wear can only be replicated by the introduction of microseparation during the simulated walking cycle. The current study presents detailed analysis of the worn surface of alumina acetabular cup and alumina femoral head following ill vitro testing incorporating microseparation at the University of Leeds, as well as retrieved ill vivo alumina hip prostheses. Four different wear zones were identified on both the acetabular cup and femoral head for both ill vitro and ill vivo specimens, defined as: mild wear, wear transition, stripe boundary and stripe wear zones. Although sequence of events cannot be verified, the available evidence indicated the following wear process of alumina hip prostheses: rather than the final stage of the wear process, fracture occurred in the early stages due to the local impact associated with microseparation, leading to the region of stripe wear. FIB cross-section investigations showed that fracture was predominantly intergranular, with some transgranular fracture, and that in both cases, fracture was restricted to the outer layer of grains. In addition, plastic deformation and a 3 rd body abrasion were also observed, with the dislocation activity also restricted to the outer grains. The wear debris liberated from the stripe wear region was believed to subsequently have resulted in wear {{in other parts of the}} joint that would otherwise have shown little evidence of damage. The stripe boundary zone, immediately adjacent to the stripe wear region, exhibited minimal wear, with a remarkably sharp boundary between the stripe wear and mild wear. The explanation for such an abrupt change from mild to severe wear were possibly abrupt change in lubrication from microseparation or small changes in the height of the alumina surface. Most of the remaining surface on the worn alumina-on-alumina THRs had experience only mild wear. Detailed analysis of this region showed that it contained extensive fine scale 3 rd body abrasion, presumably from wear debris that had become much finer due to attrition between the articulating surfaces, originally coming from the stripe wear region. Cross-sectional TEM indicated that the abrasive grooves did result in surface dislocation activity which was restricted to the outer 100 nm of the surface. In addition, differential wear between grains was observed in the mild <b>wear</b> <b>zone,</b> which was believed to be evidence of tribochemical wear. Some small additional wear scars, similar to the observations of the morphology of stripe wear and parallel to the stripe wear occurred near the stripe wear region on ill vitro and retrieved ill vivo alumina femoral heads in the mild <b>wear</b> <b>zone.</b> A wear transition zone outside the stripe <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> was identified, comprising a highly pitted surface and an amount ofwear debris. The pits had largely arisen from intergranular fracture. The extent of this region was limited compared with other wear zones and was more obvious on the alumina acetabular cup than on the alumina femoral head. Detail TEM analysis showed of this region showed extensive dislocation activity on the pyramidal system. Three types of wear debris were observed: globular wear debris, nanocrystalline wear debris and needle shaped wear debris. The globular wear debris is most likely to have come from grains been pulled out and covered by tribochemical film as it rolls over the surface. The nanocrystalline wear debris was believed to arise from 3 rd body microabrasion during the normal articulation and the needle shaped wear debris is believed to be a direct product of tribochemical wear.

METHODS Five Dynesys(®) dynamic stabilization systems consisting of pedicle screws (Ti alloy), polycarbonate-urethane (PCU) spacers and a polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) cord were explanted for pain and screw loosening after a mean of 2. 86  years (1. 9 - 5. 3  years). Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate wear, deformation and surface damage, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to assess surface chemical composition of the spacers. Periprosthetic tissue morphology and wear debris were determined using light microscopy, and PCU and PET wear debris by polarized light microscopy. RESULTS All implants had surface damage on the PCU spacers consistent with scratches and plastic deformation; 3 of 5 exhibited abrasive <b>wear</b> <b>zones.</b> In addition to fraying of the outer fibers of the PET cords in five implants, one case also evidenced cord fracture. The pedicle screws were unremarkable. Patient periprosthetic tissues around the three implants with visible PCU damage contained wear debris and a corresponding macrophage infiltration.

Teeth in the posteromedial region of the PJA are eroded into an occlusion zone where {{the teeth of the}} third pharyngobranchial are spatulate incisiform and face posteriorly in opposition to the rostrally oriented spatulate incisiform teeth in the <b>wear</b> <b>zone</b> of the fifth ceratobranchial. The shape of the teeth and their pedestals (bone of attachment) is consistent with the model and with the forces likely to operate on the elements of the PJA during mastication. The role of pharyngeal tooth replacement in maintaining the occlusal surfaces in the PJA during growth is described. The postpharyngeal alimentary tract of A. sclerolepis krefftii comprises a stomachless cylinder that attenuates gradually as it passes straight to the anus, interrupted only by a rectal valve. The ratio of gut length to standard length is about 0. 5. Despite superficial similarities to the cichlid PJA (Stiassny and Jensen [1987] Bull Mus Comp Zool 151 : 269 - 319), the hemiramphid PJA differs in the fusion of the third pharyngobranchial bones, teeth in the second pharyngobranchials and the fifth ceratobranchial face anteriorly, the presence of a slide-like diarthroses between the heads of the fourth epibranchials and the third pharyngobranchial, the occlusion zone of constantly wearing teeth, and the unusual form of the muscularis craniopharyngobranchialis. The functional relationship between these structures is explained and the consequence for the fish of a complex PJA and a simple gut is discussed. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{development}} is now driven by cost, performance, governmental regulations and customer demands. Several {{of the requirements}} have tribological associations. Tribological improvements which consist in lowering friction and improving wear resistance in engines, will {{play a major role}} to increase reliability and life cycle. The components studied here are parts of the valvetrain mechanism of heavy-duty Diesel engines. The injection cam {{is one of the most}} problematic parts of the camshaft, as it is subjected to high pressures from the fuel injector. Lubrication is of significant importance in the prevention of cam failure caused by wear. However, the satisfactory lubrication of the cam and roller contact has proved to be one of the most difficult tribological design challenges to take up. For a lubricated contact, the degree of separation between surfaces has a very strong influence on the type and amount of wear. This degree of separation is termed as specific film thickness; its value provides a measure of the severity of asperities interaction in the lubricated contact. In this report, attention is drawn on the evaluation of oil film thickness in the cam-roller contact, in order to predict regimes of lubrication and thus to identify the probable <b>wear</b> <b>zones</b> of the injection cam. Then, confrontation with experimental results is performed(observation of worn cam surfaces). Future work to achieve is to discover the influence of the different parameters on oil film thickness, by performing a multivariate analysis. The next step will focus on modelling the wear of injection cams, and finally establishing quantified correlations between wear and specific film thickness...|$|R

40|$|Sliding {{friction}} {{experiments were}} conducted with 1045 steel contacting 302 stainless steel and lubricated with various organometallics in mineral oil. Auger emission spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the element present in the <b>wear</b> contact <b>zone.</b> The results indicate that there are organometallics which are as effective an antiwear additives as the commonly used zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate. These include dimethyl cadmium, triphenyl lead thiomethoxide, and triphenyl tin chloride. The additives were examined in concentrations to 1 weight percent. With dimethyl cadmium at concentrations of 0. 5 weight percent and above, cadmium was detected in the contact zone. Coincident with the detection of cadmium, a marked decrease in the friction coefficient was observed. All additives examined reduced friction, but only the aforementioned reduced wear to a level comparable to that observed with zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate. Issued Nov. 1977.
