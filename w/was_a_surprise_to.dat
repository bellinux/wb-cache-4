5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E
5|$|At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo {{president}} Satoru Iwata {{announced that}} the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Sakurai, who left HAL Laboratory in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another Smash Bros. game, {{despite the fact that}} Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new Smash game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a private meeting with him, where he was asked to be involved as Brawls director. Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Help from a variety of studios such as Monolith Soft and Paon was enlisted, with Game Arts as the main team in the preliminary development stages. In addition, several Smash Bros. staff members that resided {{in the area of the}} new office joined the project. Altogether, roughly 100 individuals worked on the project full-time, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory.|$|E

Miller state that Queen Elizabeth 2 was the name agreed on before the launch between Cunard officials and the Queen.|$|E

Russia did not grant him sanctuary. On November 14, 1999, Öcalan arrived in Rome, Italy accompanied by Ramon Mantovani, a member of the Communist Refoundation Party, from Moscow. His arrival <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Italian government, which had not been notified, and an international crisis began as Turkey requested Öcalan's extradition.|$|E

Niger's government spokesman Mahamane Lawali Danda told the B.B.C. that the pullout <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> him since no one had told him or his government that Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' pariah nations, along with Chad, Darfur and Sudan. Strangely, Mauritania and Mali were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several al-Qaeda lead kidnappings in both during 2009.|$|E

25|$|Unveiled in 2006, the ABM project <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many observers. While DRDO had {{revealed}} some {{details about the}} project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious Akash missile and Trishul missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a year-long self-imposed investigation in November 2015, Nestlé disclosed that seafood products sourced in Thailand were produced with forced labour. Nestlé is not a major purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia, but does some business in Thailand – primarily for its Purina cat food. The study found virtually all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand are exposed to the same risks of abuse in their supply chains. This type of disclosure <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many in the industry because international companies rarely acknowledge abuses in supply chains.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall, however, bowled in {{excellent}} form for Lancashire {{right up to}} 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after an irresistible start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay, felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was left out in mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship. Nonetheless, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough. Although Tattersall was recalled at the beginning of the 1960 season, he did not do well enough to keep his place after May.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> both team {{management}} and baseball analysts. After a poor April, {{the team had}} its most successful month ever in May. Carlos Delgado led the majors in RBI, followed closely by Wells. Despite their hitting successes, poor pitching continued to plague the team. Halladay was an exception, winning his first Cy Young Award, going 22–7, with a 3.25 ERA. In July, Shannon Stewart {{was traded to the}} Minnesota Twins for Bobby Kielty, another outfielder with a much lower batting average than Stewart's. Although the Jays finished in third place in their division, Delgado was second in the voting for the American League MVP Award. In the off-season, Kielty was traded to the Oakland Athletics for starter Ted Lilly.|$|E

I had no trouble then in winning the match. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the crowd and a set-back for Koma.

500|$|As the BBC had low {{expectations}} for the series, it was not well publicised and went almost unnoticed by critics. Audiences, however, were more receptive; hours after the first episode aired in November 2004, the message board of the programme’s website crashed {{because of the number}} of visitors the site was receiving, forcing host bbc.co.uk to shut it down. This sudden interest on the serial was attributed to Richard Armitage, a relatively unknown actor, whose portrayal of the emotionally restrained John Thornton drew parallels with Colin Firth's portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy on the BBC's 1995 mini-series Pride and Prejudice, and the reception he later received. Armitage himself claims that the series was a success because of the [...] "industrial landscape and the attention [...] to the working classes and the way they develop". The reaction to the series <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the BBC, who then decided to release the DVD on 11 April 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Linklater's Boyhood, a film shot {{over the course}} of 12 years, {{occurred}} in mid-2014. It follows the life of an American boy from age 6 to 18, with Hawke playing the protagonist's father. The film became the best-reviewed film of 2014, and was named [...] "Best Film" [...] of the year by numerous critics associations. Hawke {{said in an interview that}} the attention <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> him. When he first became involved with Linklater's project, it did not feel like a [...] "proper movie," [...] and was like a [...] "radical '60s film experiment or something". At the following awards season, the film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, while winning Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama and BAFTA Award for Best Film. It also earned Hawke multiple awards nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E
500|$|Manager and label owner Gudinski {{visited the}} US in December 1974 {{to promote his}} {{recording}} artists, including Skyhooks, Daddy Cool, and Madder Lake, to major labels there. At that time only Ayers Rock were successful, with Gudinski signing them to A Records within days. He told Tony Wilson of The Sun, [...] "Jerry Moss, the president of A Records USA, flipped when he heard it, so A will release it (Big Red Rock) world-wide." [...] This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Australian media, since many other artists were more commercially successful locally than Ayers Rock. Skyhooks were Australia's most popular band; their first album (Living in the 70's, released in October 1974) sold 226,000 units, the best-selling album by a local artist in Australia to date. However, Living in the 70's was rejected by A and not released outside Australia. Ayers Rock were the first Mushroom Records artists to sign a recording contract with an international label. From the mid-1970s, and into the 1990s, Mushroom were successful with many other artists including Split Enz, Kylie Minogue, and Yothu Yindi, turning the label into Australia's largest independent record company.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a summer}} of {{deliberations}} on his future, Howard cited [...] "personal reasons" [...] including a desire {{to spend more time}} with his wife, in his September 2012 announcement that he would not be seeking re-election in the up-coming May 2013 provincial general election. This decision <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> his party because his Richmond Centre riding was considered a safe seat for him to be re-elected. With no obvious successor, a competitive BC Liberal Party primary began. By the end of the year, two candidates announced their intention to run: school trustee Grace Tsang and RCMP officer Gary Law. However, Howard approached Teresa Wat, the CEO of the Chinese language radio station CHMB, to be his replacement. Though she did not live in the riding, she was viewed as a better candidate and, in January 2013, the party announced she would be the candidate. While the other candidate Tsang withdrew his nomination to accept a position on a political advisory committee, Law alleged he was harassed to drop out and requested a RCMP investigation. Law decided to run as an independent candidate but only received xxx of the vote, with Wat winning the election and subsequently being named Minister of International Trade. Following the election Howard founded the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada to advocate for Open Sky agreements to allow more airline competition in Canadian international airports.|$|E

MacLaurin explains that Tomb of Horrors is a classic not because of its difficulty, {{but because it was}} the first module that did not involve killing large amounts of monsters; it was a [...] "collection of puzzles and maps." [...] Its focus on traps rather than monsters <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> gamers at the time. [...] One technique that some players used to get past the deathtraps was to drive cattle ahead of them, which Lore Sjöberg of Wired described as [...] "a bit less than heroic", noting that in Lord of the Rings Gandalf did not send [...] "50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait." [...] David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, discussed the adventure's reputation as [...] "the deadliest game ever written", noting that it [...] "unloads a series of complicated puzzles and nightmarish traps" [...] on characters, concluding that [...] "Few survive long enough to collect any treasure, and even fewer manage to find their way back through the deadly maze and escape with their spoils." ...|$|E
500|$|Donen {{solidified}} his solo {{career and}} scored another {{hit with the}} musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét, the film had music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd. Jane Powell plays Milly, an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam (Howard Keel) only hours after meeting him. When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods, Milly discovers that her husband's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish. She makes it her mission to domesticate them and, upon Milly's sarcastic suggestion, the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them. The film {{was shot in the}} new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences, particularly the [...] "barn raising scene" [...] in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics' 10 Best Films lists. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture), which it won. Its success <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> MGM, which had invested more money in two of its other 1954 musicals: Rose Marie and Brigadoon, starring Kelly. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was more profitable than either of its rivals, as well as On the Town and Singin' in the Rain, and its success was a major turning point for Donen's career. The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose, who described it as anti-woman, calling it [...] "one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made" [...] and a musical about rape.|$|E
