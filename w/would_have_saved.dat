5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories {{which had been}} lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond {{because they did not}} recognize him; had they recognized him, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Braathens SAFE {{placed an}} order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK100 million. They were {{intended}} to do the main haul of the charter market. There had been an internal struggle {{as to whether the}} company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bjørn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.|$|E

5|$|The healthy Joker that Talia impaled then reanimates {{into the}} shapeshifting Clayface, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. Batman defeats Clayface despite Joker blowing up the theater floor. Batman drinks {{a portion of the}} antidote, and destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it. As Batman debates curing his foe, Joker attacks him, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.|$|E

25|$|The {{aim of the}} {{campaign}} was {{for the government to}} allow controlled access to the sex offender registry, so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender was living in their area.

25|$|In 1997, Fisher began {{pursuing}} avenues to {{sell the}} property to timeshare developer ILX (now known as Diamond Resorts International) for $16.8 million. After the deal fell through, Debbie Reynolds Hotel & Casino filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy {{as part of a}} reorganization plan. The company entered into a $22.5 million merger agreement with CFI (Central Florida Investments), also known as Westgate Resorts, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> the hotel and the public company. The unsecured creditors rejected the deal and opted to auction the property hoping for a better deal. Over the objection of Management, the property was put up for auction the following year, with the winning bid at $10.65 million, going to the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Benton Area School District {{administrative}} costs were $790 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined {{the consolidation of}} Benton Area School administration with 4 neighboring districts: East Lycoming School District, Millville Area School District, Northwest Area School District and Sullivan County School District. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. The study found that consolidation with Millville Area School District would save taxpayers $1,433,719 a year. Consolidation with East Lycoming School District <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> $1,678,358 a year. The savings came from consolidating administrations without closing any local schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupation}} of the southern departments of Peru (Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá) and the Lynch expedition was proof that the army of Peru no longer possessed the skilled military manpower to defend the country. However, nothing could convince the Peruvian government to sue for peace. The defeated allies not only failed to realize their situation but, despite the empty Bolivian treasury, on June 16, 1880, the Bolivian National Assembly voted to continue the war. On June 11, 1880, a document was signed in Peru declaring {{the creation of the}} United States of Peru-Bolivia. But Piérola continued the struggle. W. Sater states: Had Piérola sued for peace in June 1880, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> countless Peruvian lives and the nation's treasure.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR {{announced}} its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the crash. The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E

25|$|Although he has {{repeatedly}} {{denied that he}} has a gambling problem, he admitted in 2003 that he settled debts totaling US$950,000 with two internet gambling sites between 1998 and 2002. The first of these incidents centered on Belize-based website CaribSports and its owner, William Caesar, to which Jágr owed $500,000. Sports Illustrated reported that Jágr agreed to make monthly payments to Caesar to settle the debt, and Caesar leaked the story to the press when Jágr stopped making payments. In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $3.27 million lien against him for unpaid taxes for the 2001 tax year. Only a few months before, Jágr had settled a $350,000 claim for taxes dating to 1999. In the summer of 2006, Jágr sued his former accountant over a tax form that {{was supposed to have been}} filed in 2003, claiming that the form <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> him $6 million had it been filed in a timely fashion.|$|E
500|$|Naomi was {{the seventeenth}} {{tropical}} depression, fourteenth tropical storm {{and the fourth}} hurricane of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Its precipitation on the Mexican Altiplano briefly threatened the unfinished Lázaro Cárdenas dam on the Nazas River. If the dam failed, [...] the twin cities of Gómez Palacio, Durango, and Torreón, Coahuila, would have been inundated. On the other hand, releasing water from the dam <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> Torreón by submerging Gómez Palacio with the dam's runoff. From help with satellite imagery, the authorities decided to keep the dam closed—risking its possible failure—saving both towns.|$|E
500|$|Like Kentucky, Illinois {{differed}} from her earlier sisters in that her design {{called for an}} all-welded construction, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull used on the four completed Iowa-class ships. Engineers considered retaining the original Montana-class armor for added torpedo and naval mine protection because the newer scheme would have improved Illinoiss armor protection {{by as much as}} 20%. This was rejected due to time constraints and Illinois was built with an Iowa-class hull design. Funding for the battleship was provided in part by [...] "King Neptune", a Hereford swine auctioned across the state of Illinois as a fundraiser, ultimately helping to raise $19 million in war bonds.|$|E

500|$|In his 1978 {{biography}} of Victor Trumper, Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull's {{words to the}} press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's Sun. Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that [...] "Bradman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> {{me a lot of}} backlash... had he admitted that he had given the leak. Part of his job was writing for the Sydney Sun and he had every right to leak such a vital story." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{extended}} scene established Bruce in the Batcave {{shortly after}} having discussed with Dick then that this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> his {{life after the}} battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being [...] "a killer", and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from Batman Returns, specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This would explain why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems in the Batcave telling Dick he gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
500|$|A story {{considered}} for the fourth series. This would have contained an [...] alien called The Rider, who invades Bannerman Road and sets a countdown which will explode the entire neighborhood. Then, they would have kidnapped Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani {{and replace them with}} evil identical-lookalikes. This episode would have seen the appearance of the Weeping Angels, making it the first time they'd crossover in the SJA series. After these events, the Doctor, and his companions Amy and Rory, would have traveled to Alpha Metraxis, which is the Weeping Angels' planet, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> Sarah and the friends, also making it the first time Amy and Rory had met Sarah-Jane and her gang and the first time they fully appeared in SJA. The Doctor, Sarah and company would have traveled back to Earth, to Bannerman Road and stopped the time-bomb from exploding, though it would have destroyed half of the neighborhood. This was intended to be the Series 4 finale. Maria and Alan would have returned.|$|E
