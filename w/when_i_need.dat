500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, {{but to me}} it is a medicine. I keep it around and take it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> it. But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|Before {{he could}} move, however, {{he had to}} dispose of his {{thousands}} of [...] glass-plate negatives. [...] He also had to get himself out of debt once again. [...] In an attempt to accomplish both of these at once, he offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. [...] To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, [...] "Now {{is the time to}} buy me cheap, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> the money so badly." [...] In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. [...] Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase.|$|E
500|$|Smith married English-Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were {{divorced}} in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted {{for six years}} and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated [...] "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to," [...] and {{that she is a}} [...] "private" [...] actress. In 2009, she commented, [...] "People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better." [...] Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted [...] "It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory." ...|$|E

500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{reviewed}} Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, {{despite its}} many crash bugs and glitches. Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to performing, Staton {{received}} a 12-page document that outlined the story, {{and the history}} of Phelps. He has said that he received the document as there wasn't enough time to read the 2,200-page script before filming began. Staton cumulatively worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months. He said, [...] "consecutively I think I worked six months, and then for the next year here and there picking things up, adding, changing and tweaking things". When discussing his character, McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps, but eventually warmed up to him. [...] "Like a good older brother he'll always have his back but will never take shit from him," [...] he said. McGrady, who portrayed Rusty Galloway, said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character. [...] "I am a classic introvert but I can hold court <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to. I think Rusty is that way too," [...] McGrady said. Harrington described Roy as [...] "jaded, tough, mean, cruel, brutally honest and ... very funny". He took credit for all of Roy's facial expressions, but said that all of the dialogue was scripted, as opposed to ad-lib. Many characters in the game are influenced by real people and events; for example, Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both McNamara's father, and LAPD Captain Jack Donahue. Additionally, many cases that Phelps solves are based off real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case.|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak {{noted that}} Beyoncé [...] "ecstatically and hyperactively" [...] changes keys four {{times during the}} entire song. As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush, she {{constantly}} sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past, this being illustrated in lyrics such as, [...] "after fighting through my fears [...] finally you've put me first." [...] The chorus, complimented with sweet backing harmonies, then arrives, with Beyoncé chanting, [...] "Baby it's you, you're the one I love / You're the one I need / You're the only one I see / Come on baby it's you / You're the one that gives your all / You're the one I can always call / <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top." [...] The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes, proceeding to D♭, then to D, E♭ and finally to [...] E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that [...] "the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder-reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes." [...] In this way, the word [...] "baby" [...] is said about 24 times throughout the song. As soon as the synthesizers drop out, the song fades out almost instantaneously.|$|E
