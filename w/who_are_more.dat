5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30.

Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
