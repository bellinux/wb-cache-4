With development of organic extractants for separating and recovering these fission products, solvent extraction offers a versatile alternative to ion-exchange, precipitation, and crystallization procedures heretofore used for small-scale recoveries. A process flowsheet was developed for the recovery of strontium and mixed rare earths from adjusted Purex 1 WW solution {{by the use of}} di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA). After adding tartrate t complex the iron and caustic to adjust the pH to 6, strontium and rare earths are co-extracted and then co-stripped with nitric acid in the first cycle. In additional D 2 EHPA extraction cycles, they are isolated as concentrated fractions. The mixed rare earths from this process can be treated by tributyl phosphate (TBP) extraction to separate the individual rare earth elements of which promethium and cerium are of greatest interest. Zirconium [...] niobium also may be recovered with D 2 EHPA from acidic <b>waste</b> <b>liquors.</b> An amine pretreatment extraction process was developed for removing nitric acid, iron sulfate, zirconium [...] niobium, and ruthenium from waste solutions to furnish a feed liquor more amenable to subsequent processes for recovering fission products. The separate recovery of ruthenium, zirconium [...] niobium, and rare earths may also be possible by amine extraction. A process based on the use of substituted phenols was developed for recovering cesium from alkaline waste solutions. These compounds are selective extractants for cesium, giving high decontamination from other fission products and sodium, and they are readily stripped with dilute nitric acid. Previous studies also outlined methods for recovering neptunium, plutonium, and technetium with solvents similar to those described.

In this research, to reduce energy consumption for preparation of nanocellulose, we used organosolv straw pulp (OSP) which was never dried after cooking and bleaching. Never-dried cellulose is better than once-dried samples because the latter are known to irreversibly lose surface accessibility as a result of drying. Using of never-dried cellulose does not require consumption of energy for drying and grinding since dried cellulose fibers lose the ability to swell and percolate due to irreversible cornification.

Oxytetracycline was concentrated more than 3 times to 3000 - 4000 mg/l in the retentate. Due to likely the high concentration of large biopolymers interacting with OTC molecules, OTC could not be successfully recovered from the RO retentate by conventional crystallization. With additional treatment of ultrafiltration by 3 K membranes, OTC crystallization and recovery from the RO retentate were significantly improved with a recovery ratio of more than 60 % and a purity of higher than 80 %. Detailed studies indicated that most large biopolymers in the OTC liquor were polysaccharides that would either hinder the growth of OTC crystals or precipitate together with OTC molecules. Removal of these large biopolymers by ultrafiltration could improve the condition remarkably for OTC crystallization.

It {{is necessary to}} determine the oxygen demanded for the oxidative decomposition. As one method for measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD), permanganate oxidation is mainly used in Japan, and the procedure is authorized as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS). We tested utilities of the method using soluble starch, egg white albumin, lignosulfonate solution and their mixtures with metal sulfate as model of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor.</b> COD of these macromolecules were variously changed {{by the addition of}} metal ions. Above all, COD of soluble starch solution was remarkably diminished by divalent ions, such as Cu^ 2 + and Mg^ 2 +, trivalent ion Fe^ 3 + and monovalent K^+. The extent diminished was about 40 % in each mixture. Such conspicuous diminution of COD was not found in albumin-or LSA-metal ion mixture. COD of LSA-Cu^ 2 + mixture augmented more than that of LSA solution by a factor of 1. 1. In the mixture containing two sorts of macromolecules, COD also diminished by the addition of metal ions. These experimental results show that COD of the macromolecule solution measured can resist against permanganate oxidation. As this poorly-oxidizable complex was not conformed irreversibly, COD of the starch-metal mixture, above all, gradually increased as time passed. These experimental results show that COD of the macromelecule solution measured by permanganate consumption (JIS method) changes and always diminishes remarkably by the co-existence with other macromolecule and metal ion. Then, it may be concluded that JIS method can not be successfully adopted as a general one to analyze many kinds of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> which varies the sorts and the content of organic and inorganic matter. The incompleteness of the method is due to the weak oxidative potentiality of permanganate reagent. Development of rapid COD analytical methods using more stronger oxidizing agent such as dichromate are claimed. Measurement of TOC (total organic carbon) is more favorable as the more strict indicator of water-pollution control, though the analytical procedure is yet unsettled. 各種排水中の有機物は微生物によつてあるいは非生物的に酸化分解されるので,その汚染度を規定するためには酸化分解に要する酸素量を測定する必要がある. この化学的酸素要求量(COD) を測定する方法としては,わが国では過マンガン酸酸化によるものが主に用いられており,本法は日本工業規格(JIS) に表示されている. 排水のモデルとして,可溶性でんぷん,卵白アルブミン,LSA溶液およびそれらの金属硫酸塩との混液を用いて本法の有効性を検定した. これらの高分子物質のCODは金属イオンの添加によつて変化し,その程度は高分子物質と金属イオンの組み合せによつて異なつていた. 特に可溶性でんぶん溶液のCODはCu^ 2 ＋,Mg^ 2 ＋などの二価イオン,さらにFe^ 3 ＋およびK^+によつて著しく減少した. しかしアルブミン－,LSA－金属塩混液では顕著なCODの減少は認められなかつた.

Organic impurities separated from actual OTC fermentation <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> by ultrafiltration were dosed into a pure OTC solution at various concentrations. The results demonstrated that small organic molecules with an apparent molecular weight (AMW) of below 10, 000 Da did not affect OTC crystallization significantly. However, large biopolymers, especially poly saccharides, in the fermentation waste caused severe retardation {{of crystal growth and}} considerable deterioration in the purity of the OTC crystallized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that OTC nuclei formed in the solution attached to the surfaces of large organic molecules, probably polysaccharides, instead of being surrounded by proteins as previously thought. It is proposed that the attachment of OTC nuclei to biopolymers would prevent OTC from rapid crystallization, resulting in a high OTC residue in the aqueous phase. In addition, the adsorption of OTC clusters onto biopolymers would destabilize the colloidal system of organic macromolecules and promote particle flocculation. OTC crystallization would therefore take place with the precipitation of abundant organic impurities. Hence, the removal of polysaccharides and other biopolymers by ultrafiltration can be an effective means of improving the recovery of OTC and similar antibiotics by crystallization from the fermentation waste.

40|$|During this {{quarterly}} period, {{an experimental}} investigation {{was performed to}} study the precipitation kinetics and hydrolysis characteristics of calcium imido disulfonate crystals (CaADS). The CaADS crystals were precipitated by a metathetical reaction of lime, supplied by Dravo Lime Co., with flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber <b>waste</b> <b>liquor.</b> Before approaching for the continuous Double Draw-Off (DDO) crystallization studies, {{the influence of a}} Dravo lime slurry on the precipitation characteristics of N-S compounds will be established. A series of N-S compound batch crystallization studies were completed {{in a wide range of}} pH (7. 0 [...] 9. 0), and the influence of pH on the amount of lime required, as well as the amount of precipitate obtained, was investigated. Although the amount of precipitate increased with increase in solution pH, the safe or optimum pH for the precipitation of CaADS lies in the vicinity of 8. 2 to 8. 3. For studying the crystallization characteristics of CaADS crystals, a bench scale 7. 0 liter DDO crystallizer was built. DDO crystallizer is found to be superior compared to Mixed Suspension Mixed Product Removal (MSMPR) crystallizer. The precipitated crystals were analyzed for elemental composition by chemical analysis. The crystals were also examined under optical microscope for their morphological features. The present studies confirmed our prediction that N-S compounds in the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> can be precipitated by a reaction with lime slurry. The precipitated crystals were mostly calcium imido disulfonate...|$|E
40|$|Besides the {{synthetic}} binders also tannins {{can be used}} for the manufacture of wood-based materials. Results related to the development of natural binder systems make clear that also tannins from spruce bark are suitable for the manufacture of particleboards and medium density fibreboards (MDF). The tannins were obtained through extraction of spruce bark with water and/or sulphite <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> and then mixed with usual commercial quebracho tannin. The cross linking agent was formaldehyde. The strength properties of the MDF manufactured with these binder systems meet the requirements for their application in humid areas. MDF manufactured with pure spruce tannin formaldehyde resin as binder corresponded to the board type MDF (application in dry areas) ...|$|E
50|$|The metal {{chloride}} solution (in {{the most}} common case <b>waste</b> pickle <b>liquor</b> from a carbon steel pickling line) is fed to the venturi evaporator (III), where direct mass and heat exchange with the hot roast gas from the roaster (reactor/cyclone) takes place. The separator (IV) separates the gas and liquid phase of the venturi evaporator product. The liquid phase is re-circulated back to the venturi evaporator to increase mass and heat exchange performance.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the production of biogas from abattoir cow <b>liquor</b> <b>waste</b> (CLW) on biogas production of some agroindustrial wastes. The wastes; brewery spent grain (BS), cassava waste water (CW) and carbonated soft drink sludge (CS) were combined with definite proportions of cow <b>liquor</b> <b>waste</b> to produce biogas under anaerobic digestion for a 25 day retention period. The wastes were combined in the ratios: CLW:BS (1 : 1), CLW:CS (3 : 1) and CLW:CW (1 : 3). The results obtained indicated increased biogas production when BS and CW were inoculated with CLW, while it had {{a negative effect on}} CS. The mean biogas production of BS and CS were 8. 72 and 8. 12 L, respectively, while CW had no biogas production. When inoculated with CLW, the mean biogas production of BS increased to 24. 28 L. CW experienced gas production with mean biogas yield of 8. 36 L while the gas production of CS reduced to 2. 84 L. The CLW:BS blend had the shortest time lag from gas production to onset of gas flammability of 7 days while CLW:CW and CLW:CS had time lag of 10 and 11 days respectively. The retention times for the CLW:CW and CLW:CS was 17 and 21 days, respectively. Overall results indicated that while the low biogas and/or flammable biogas production of brewery spent grain could be enhanced significantly in the presence of cow <b>liquor</b> <b>waste.</b> Cassava waste water which could not produce biogas could be made to be a cheap source of biogas by inoculating it with cow <b>liquor</b> <b>waste...</b>|$|R
