2500|$|The {{narrative}} in Acts 1 takes place 40 {{days after the}} Resurrection: Jesus, {{in the company of}} the disciples, is taken up in their sight after warning them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the Holy Spirit; as he ascends a cloud hides him from their view, and two men in white appear to tell them that he will return [...] "in the same <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen him go into heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, {{you have}} not been saints in the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even your own people. But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be {{considered}} a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Acts 1 {{describes}} a meal on the Mount of Olives, where Jesus commands the disciples {{to await the}} coming of the Holy Spirit, a cloud takes him upward from sight, and two men in white appear to tell them (the disciples) that he will return [...] "in the same <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen him go into heaven." [...] Luke and Acts appear to describe the same event, but present quite different chronologies, Luke placing it on the same day as the Resurrection and Acts forty days afterwards; various proposals have been put forward to resolve the contradiction, but the question remains open.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not going," [...] said Mr. Traveller, glancing {{in after}} him; [...] "you won't {{get rid of}} me in that <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> better come and talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind. You know. If you can't {{get over}} it in any other <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go away. You must do {{something}} for yourself before {{you can think of}} marrying.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much I {{loved that}} <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> Of smiling most, when very sad, A smile which carried tender hints Of sun and spring, And yet, {{more than all}} other thing, Of weariness beyond all words." ...|$|R
2500|$|The US position, as {{presented}} to the UN General Assembly {{a month before the}} incident by President George W. Bush, was that sovereign states have [...] "an obligation to govern responsibly, and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organized crime." [...] Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about the raid that, [...] "When you are dealing with states that do not maintain their sovereignty and become a de facto sanctuary, the only <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to deal with them is this kind of operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
6000|$|... "Byansy-Alzumy-Ann! {{who taught}} {{you to call}} me marm! Is this the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned your catechism? Say, ma', this instant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not that. But you have--I {{may tell}} you this much--the {{automatic}} increase of your property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands. And in certain other <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> influence, with your eighteenth century notions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To this Mr. Petter remarked," [...] said Lodloe, [...] "that {{he thought}} in many <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{improved}} very much, {{but he was}} obliged {{to admit that he}} could never think of anything that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done which was of the least benefit to yourself or anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Not {{till the}} gay crowd {{had been left}} behind did Honor turn to Phoebe, and say gently, 'My dear, if he is gone off in any foolish <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better tell me at once, that {{something}} may be done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we {{introduce}} ourselves?" [...] said Ashe. [...] "Or did Mrs. Bell {{tell you}} my name? By the <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not been here long, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{appeal to}} your friends," [...] he said, [...] "they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in {{judgement}} on my case. By the <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not introduced me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} that <b>way!</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> n't {{advanced}} {{so rapidly}} as I used to think you would; you haven't distinguished yourself so much," [...] she went on, irrelevantly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'God grant he may!' muttered Bunce, 'without his hum and ha, and swaying {{this way}} and that, till he never moves at all! Betwixt his caution, and this lad's moonstruck <b>ways,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a fair course before you, Sir Giles! See, what's the lad doing now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wanted revenge--not in the {{ordinary}} <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> brooded over it too long. You understood too well. Once it was I who sought to revenge myself on you because you would not listen to me! You hurt my pride. Everything that was evil in me rebelled--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a fishing-rod amongst your things; if {{you find}} the time hang heavy on your hands to-morrow, or wish {{to keep out of}} the <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better come over to Bratham Lake and fish. There are some very large carp and perch there, and pike too, for the matter of that, but they are out of season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{pointing}} out that I can trace my ancestry a long <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to trace things {{a long way in}} Brooklyn, {{if you want to find}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|DR. JONATHAN. But {{you listen}} every Sunday to Moses--if it was Moses?--when he talks in this <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> made up your mind, haven't you, that Minnie has broken the Commandment? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you put on}} airs with me, Tom Rover. You are in {{our power}} and you shall suffer for the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> treated my father and me in the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop! {{and hear}} the end," [...] I cried. [...] "Stop! and you shall know how I befriended you. A word from me would have told the men which <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone--and I never spoke that word. I helped your escape--I made it safe and certain. Think, try to think. Try to {{understand}} what I tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you are--but {{not in the}} <b>way</b> <b>you</b> mean. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> made me discontented with myself, that's all, and I'm {{going to}} get out of the tall timber and see if I can't do {{something}} in the big world. I want to win your respect." ...|$|R
60|$|THE DEVIL. You, Senora, cannot {{come this}} <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> will <b>have</b> an apotheosis. But {{you will be}} at the palace before us.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do, Greenly," [...] he said, in a mild, quiet tone. [...] "Let run the top-gallant-halyards, {{and haul}} up the fore-sail. The <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> {{will bring you}} fairly alongside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How you do run on!" [...] she said. [...] "You {{wait and}} find out the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to wash dishes and all. We'll see what we see, my fine young whiffet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's a funny <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> of sleeping," [...] replied Peter Rabbit. [...] "Come, Sammy, {{be honest}} {{and tell me what}} you were yelling 'thief' for, over in the Green Forest?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{accepting}} {{his resignation}} with regret, President Bill Clinton stated that [...] "you have helped restore Americans' trust that the EEOC is an agency dedicated to providing prompt and fair enforcement {{of civil rights}} laws. In these and in many other <b>ways,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been {{an important part of}} our mission to make America a nation of equal opportunity for all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{remember}} that you are still a monk, Roger, although enlarged for a season. Some day, perhaps, {{you will be able}} to gratify your desires in that <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> best moderate the speed of your horse, for although he ambles along merrily, at present, he can never carry that great carcase of yours, at this pace, through our journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thankee, my boy," [...] said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as {{he helped}} Mrs. Bradshaw in and {{stood with his}} foot on the step. [...] "By the <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go back and lock my pocket-book up. I left it on the washstand, and there's best part of a {{thousand}} pounds in it. You can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now turn again, turn again, {{said the}} pinder, [...] For a wrong <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> gone, [...] For you have forsaken the king's highway, [...] And made a path over the corn." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "Yes; that is {{what took}} my fancy in you, Willis: that generosity, that real gentleness, {{in spite of the}} brusque <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> Refinement of the heart, I call it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guk-uk-uk-uk! guk-uk-uk-uk!" [...] {{was the way}} he laughed; and if {{you think}} a {{hippopotamus}} does not laugh this <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> but to listen to one and you will find I am right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} are willing to {{undertake}} the risk, and unquestionably the Bombay Government would see, with great pleasure, Nana's return to power, I will throw no obstacle in your <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> better, to begin with, write me a formal request for a month's leave to go down to Bombay. Is there anything else that I can do, to aid your project?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a {{very serious}} matter, Small," [...] said the detective. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> had a better chance at your trial." ...|$|R
