25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} tennis {{lies in the}} monastic cloisters in 12th-century France, where the ball was struck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the hand in a game called jeu de paume. Rackets were {{introduced}} to the game in the early 16th century. This original version of tennis, now called [...] "real tennis", was mostly played indoors and popular among the royalty and gentry, while a crude outdoor version called longue paume was played by the populace. The prominence of the game declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, although there are sporadic mentions of a [...] "long tennis" [...] or [...] "field tennis" [...] version {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E

500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held {{his head to}} one side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another rumor is that Dempsey used a {{knuckleduster}} {{during the}} first round. [...] Some speculated that the object used was a rail spike. In the Los Angeles Times on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. [...] He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey {{can be seen at}} various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the glove in question, making it unlikely that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove.|$|E
2500|$|Merengues {{are fast}} {{arrangements}} with a [...] beat. The traditional instrumentation for a conjunto típico (traditional band), the usual performing group of folk merengue, is a diatonic accordion, a two–sided drum, called a tambora, {{held on the}} lap, and a güira. A güira is a percussion instrument {{that sounds like a}} maraca. It is a sheet of metal with small bumps on it (created with hammer and nail), shaped into a cylinder, and played with a stiff brush. The güira is brushed steadily on the downbeat with a [...] "and-a" [...] thrown in at certain points, or played in more complex patterns that generally mark the time. Caballito rhythm, or a quarter and two eighths, is also common. The double headed drum is played on one side with a stick syncopation {{and on the other side}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the hand.|$|E

2500|$|First, {{three of}} these terms are {{associated}} with sign ambiguities: the line integral [...] could go around the loop in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise); the vector area [...] could point in {{either of the two}} directions normal to the surface; and [...] is the net current passing through the surface , meaning the current passing through in one direction, minus the current in the other direction—but either direction could be chosen as positive. These ambiguities are resolved by the right-hand rule: <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the right-hand toward the area of integration, and the index-finger pointing along the direction of line-integration, the outstretched thumb points in the direction that must be chosen for the vector area [...] Also the current passing {{in the same direction as}} [...] must be counted as positive. The right hand grip rule can also be used to determine the signs.|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to one side}} towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{believe that}} the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century {{northern}} France, where a ball was struck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as {{the first person to}} construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris [...] "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.|$|E
