5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to simply drive the patients {{from place to}} place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, {{although it may be}} acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, <b>whose</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world.
