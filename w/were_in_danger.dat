5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Near the Potawatomi Zoo are the Potawatomi Greenhouses and the Ella Morris and Muessel-Ellison Botanical Conservatories.

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces {{that had been used}} to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled.

5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger.</b> By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E

By the time the tour reaches London, Madonna gets irritated with the journeys. Kabbalah comes into the picture with explanations of the mystical practice from Madonna and her teacher Eitan. At Slane Castle, Dublin, Madonna and her dancers <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of being electrocuted due to constant rain, but she nevertheless continued the performances.|$|E
50|$|For most aveirot (such as {{violating the}} {{restrictions}} of Shabbat), if one must commit the aveira to save or possibly save {{a human life}} that is believed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger,</b> s/he <b>is</b> required to do so, and such an act is not considered an aveira, but is rather the fulfillment {{of one of the}} greatest mitzvot. This is the situation, regardless of whether this is a one-time occurrence, or must take place on a regular, on-going basis. Pikuach nefesh applies to Jews and gentiles whose lives <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> alike, but not to animals whose lives <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|R

5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs {{were removed from the}} island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark {{that the}} Nazis {{considered}} {{his family to}} be Jewish, and that they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of being arrested.

When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number that they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
