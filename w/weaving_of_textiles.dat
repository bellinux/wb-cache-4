In this work Riegl sought to refute the materialist account {{of the origins of}} decorative motifs from, for example, the <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles,</b> a theory that was associated with the followers of Gottfried Semper. Instead, Riegl attempted to describe a continuous and autonomous [...] "history of ornament." [...] To this end he followed certain ornamental motifs, such as the arabesque, from ancient near eastern through classical and up into early medieval and Islamic art, in the process developing the idea of a Kunstwollen (difficult to translate, although [...] "will to art" [...] is one possibility). Riegl seems to have conceived the Kunstwollen as a historically contingent tendency of an age or a nation that drove stylistic development without respect to mimetic or technological concerns. Its proper interpretation, however, has itself been a subject of scholarly debate for over a century.|$|E

40|$|The <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> in Sa 2 ̆ 7 dan Toraja, a {{district}} {{on the island}} of Sulawesi in Indonesia, is layered with many social and cultural influences. Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in three Sa 2 ̆ 7 dan Toraja villages, I suggest the matriarchial social organization of the village life is the most significant factor influencing the production and sales of textiles. The status and hiearchy of the matriarchies is controlled by the local belief system adhered to by the Sa 2 ̆ 7 dan Toraja known as adat. Several government proposals for weaving cooperatives have been assigned and distributed throughout the Sa 2 ̆ 7 dan Toraja area, however only two have been accepted by the local population due to the social and political organization of the local hierarchial matriarchies. The weaving co-operative projects are supported by local government legislation, but when it is time for distribution of the funding only the weavers belonging to the hight status matriarchies will come forward and receive the funds. Weavers from lower status matriarchies will not come forward because by doing so they would be going against the religious and socio-cultural customs governing their society. The high status matriarchies also control the <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> by not sharing their knowledge of the supplementary weft techniques and most importantly, the knowledge of warping. Without this technical skill no weaving can take place. Traditional weaving knowledge is passed from one group of sisters to their daughters and shared only within this social group; thereby, preserving their knowledge and maintaining their exclusive status...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} discover whether weavers could identify markers of authenticity {{of their own}} community-based and culturally bound hand-woven textiles. If so, {{how do they do}} it? What is the nature and meaning of these markers? Three case studies were selected that represented communities making such textiles at different levels of institutionalisation. The first case focused on the non-insitutionalised Mosuo hand-woven textiles, a minority group in southwest China. This is contrasted with the fully legally institutionalised and branded Harris Tweed of Scotland. In between these two extremes, a study on Bhutanese kiras where the design and <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> are culturally institutionalised without a legal framework or a commercial brand. A pilot study phase informed the use of an ethnographic approach to field research conducted at the three sites employing a diverse range of methods including face-to-face interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires. When opportunities arose, indirect methods were included such as unobtrusive observations, examinations of exemplar textiles, and review through 'thick' descriptions in reflective journals. Data from these qualitative studies were distilled and confirmed through quantitative follow-up methods. The results indicated that for the Mosuo weavers, it is her experience of being a Mosuo weaver and the spirit in which the textiles are woven that determined authenticity. For culturally structured societies such as in Bhutan, authenticity was dependent on the contexts in which the kira was meant to be worn, reflected in turn through the physical characteristics of the kira. The markers of authenticity of Harris Tweed relied on objective characteristics including the geographical site where the cloth is produced. Central to the experience of the weaver in all three studies was the pride in weaving the textile, a finding which identifies this element as a common marker of its authenticity...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} and constant color change inherent in our environment is an endless source of wonder and inspiration to me. Many times {{the landscape and}} our atmosphere appear as a woven surface composed of melting layers of interrelated lines, shapes and colors. This panorama invariably provides me with a palette of merging colors and abstract patterns. In viewing the water of rivers and streams from the surface, we see what is below and also reflections mirrored from above. A river swells and diminishes [...] it moves and bends and carries color {{in and out of}} the field of vision. Color rays of light form pathways in and out, above and below; sometimes smooth and flowing, sometimes full of vibrant energy, creating a tension between the glowing background in space and the pathway moving through it. It is this imagery I seek to capture in weaving. In my present work I investigated the movements of these light paths through color shifts in the dyeing and <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles.</b> This process led to an exploration into the function of color, how space and depth illusions are created, and the challenge to create mood, a suggestion, of place. I began evaluating ???. thinking???. assimilating???. hoping to incorporate both control and spontaneity in a perceptive, harmonious balance -finding an avenue to solve formal problems but not rigidly adhering to them. The fiber pieces in the exhibition are warp-faced, which means the longitudinal threads are closely spaced concealing the weft, the horizontal element. Before the weaving begins, the warp threads are separately resist tied in small bundles, then dyed, retied and overdyed depending on the design. These warp threads must be stretched taut while tying the resist to allow clarity in the development of the design movement. As a means of establishing an added color relationship, whether it be a darker value to provide background or spatial dimension, or another hue to provide a certain contrast, a second or alternating warp was dyed. This warp alternates, thread by thread, with the initially dyed warp and in the finished weaving provides alternate horizontal lines. Using a second warp in this manner creates color patterns without changing the basic underlying simple weave. Perhaps it might be thought of as a "Venetian blind" effect. (See more in text...|$|E

40|$|Material and {{behavioural}} elements {{associated with}} the term Neolithic are almost completely absent in Australia. Among the few exceptions are the domesticated dog (originating in the Near East and reaching Australia by 3, 500 years ago as the dingo), together with limited evidence for permanent set-tlements, food storage, long-distance trade and manipulation of wild resources in some areas. While {{it has been suggested}} that the latter developments represent independent local trends toward more complex societies that might have led to an Australian Neolithic if not for the arrival of Europeans, the Neolithic is essentially conspicuous by its absence. Par-ticularly striking is the absence of agricultural practices, despite recent claims to the contrary.

40|$|Compressed air {{is a major}} {{component}} of energy costs incurred in the <b>weaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> fabrics on air-jet looms. The consumption of compressed air in air-jet weaving depends on different process variables. In this study, the effect of weft yarn count, reed count, fabric width and loom speed on the compressed air consumption of air-jet loom was determined using response surface methodology. Fabric width was found to be the most dominant factor affecting the air consumption followed by loom speed, reed count, and weft yarn count respectively. A statistical model for predicting the compressed air consumption on air-jet loom was developed. The prediction ability and accuracy of the developed model was assessed by the fitted line plot between the predicted and actual air consumption values. The prediction model may be used for optimizing the production planning, estimating the share of compressed air cost in weaving a particular fabric style, and in identifying any air wastages in the weaving shed by comparing the actual compressed air consumption with that predicted by the model which was developed under controlled conditions without any air leakages...|$|R
