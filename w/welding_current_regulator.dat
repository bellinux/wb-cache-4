Results show that the increase of <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> and the decrease of welding speed bring about the large amount of heat input in the welding pool and the enlargement of width and deepness of the welding pool. The increase of impulse frequency has the same effect on the microstructure compared with the increase of <b>welding</b> <b>current.</b> The effect of welding parameters on the tensile strength and fracture was analyzed.

The effect of heat input on the weld metal chemistry, morphologies and chemistry of inclusions and nucleation of acicular ferrite (AF), grain boundary ferrite (GBF) and Widmanstatten ferrite (WF) were evaluated.

At <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> about 100 Amp, welding speed 400 mm/min and shielding gas of Ar+ 5 %H 2, after welding test was found that the elongation values are 20 % and at <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> about 90 Amp, welding speed 300 mm/min and Shielding gas of Ar+ 5 %H 2, after welding test was found that the hardness values is 278. 33 HV, respectively. 2) The analysis results of microstructures of the specimens on ultimate tensile strength which are higher and lower strength values were found that microstructures of columnar dendrite and the growth of grains on the heat-affected zone are more differences, that is the area of columnar dendrite is smaller than the specimens on higher ultimate tensile strength and the growth of grains on the heat-affected zone are The chromium carbide (Cr 23 C 6) can be occurred on both of all conditions...|$|R
