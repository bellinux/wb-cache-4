Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and free lance photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago's most controversial political organizers, Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party. The committee evolved into the Heart of Uptown Coalition, a political and social service organization steeped in the rhetoric of Marxism; [...] "comrades" [...] were expected to organize [...] "cadres." [...] "We must have the frame of mind that as revolutionaries <b>we</b> <b>have</b> (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to solve any problem that comes our way..." [...] Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park {{that is home to}} a significant population of low income households.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, the Chao {{brothers}} and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the multiracial band Mano Negra. Manu Chao said in Alt.Latino in 2011, [...] "Mano Negra started {{playing in a}} subway in Paris before the band started to be known and selling records. We started in a subway for a living. This is what made the musicians of Mano Negra. And so the people using the subway in Paris was very eclectic. There was people {{from a lot of}} different countries, different cultures. So <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play all kind of music to please all the people in a subway. So that was a perfect school to learn a lot of different styles of music." [...] Starting on a smaller label, the group released a reworked version of the Hot Pants single [...] "Mala Vida" [...] in 1988, which quickly became a hit in France. The group soon moved to Virgin Records, and their first album Patchanka was released the following year. Though the group never gained much fame in the English-speaking market, popularity {{throughout the rest of the}} world soon followed, reaching the Top 5 in the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. The band achieved some fame in South America with 1992's Cargo Tour, where it played a series of shows in port cities, performing from a stage built into their tour ship's hold. Mano Negra also performed a tour through much of Colombia in a retired train, the [...] "Ice Express". [...] Still, rifts began to grow among band members during the port tour and the following year's train tour; many band members, including Manu's brother Antoine, had left the group by the end of 1994. Following that year's release of their final album, Casa Babylon, Manu Chao moved the band to Madrid, but legal problems with former band mates led Chao to disband the group in 1995.|$|E

If we want secularism and atheism to gain respect, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to disagree with each other without trying to destroy each other. In other words <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manage disagreement ethically, like reasonable adults, as opposed to brawling like enraged children who need a nap. It should go without saying, but this means no death threats, rape threats, attacks on people’s appearance, age, race, sex, size, haircut; no photoshopping people into demeaning images, no vulgar epithets." [...] Dawkins added, [...] "I’m told that some people think I tacitly endorse such things even if I don’t indulge in them. Needless to say, I’m horrified by that suggestion. Any person who tries to intimidate members of our community with threats or harassment is in no way my ally and is only weakening the atheist movement by silencing its voices and driving away support." ...|$|E

Before we place a new facility for waste management at some location <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the risks this facility brings into a new environment and according to this the best solution must be chose. At the same time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared for other problems that may occur. One of them is social rejection, which can be reduced with raising the population and with economical benefits. When chossing the location of landfills <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow the Operational program of disposing communal waste.
