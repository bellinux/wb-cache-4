When they arrive to a hero's welcome in Washington, Doc notices that Hank's mother is on the list of mothers of the dead flag raisers. Ira angrily denounces the bond drive as a farce. The men are reprimanded by Bud Gerber of the Treasury Department, who tells them that the country cannot afford the war and if the bond drive fails the U.S. will abandon the Pacific and their sacrifices <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing.</b> The three agree not to tell anyone that Hank was not in the photograph.|$|E

Though his family is distraught that he is returning again to Peru, Oliver tells his wife he must close the deal or all of their previous sacrifices <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing.</b> Oliver recruits Ricardo to research Caravedo.

Ripley doesnt care for how they got there and insists that they go back the way they came and leave the station, telling them they will not survive if they go on any further and that there is nothing they can do. In the end, Ripley thanks Call: [...] "You did the right thing, bringing me back out into the black, I know that now. Please -- go. Let me do what I can do... Let me finish the job".|$|E

50|$|The earth’s {{atmosphere}} currently {{contains about}} 459 ppm CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases. At that elevated level {{we are now}} into the danger zone. It is well understood that as the concentrations of CO2 approach 550 ppm there is near certainty that the earth will warm 2 degrees, and will probably warm 3 degrees, an amount of warming that would be fully catastrophic. Over the next 30 years as the tar sands are exploited under current plans, this one source alone will add about 65 ppm of carbon dioxide to earth’s atmosphere. Even if nobody else on earth created carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, exploitation of the tar sands will push the level of CO2 in our atmosphere to 525 ppm. This one source will single-handedly cancel out all worldwide efforts to control climate change. All the good effects of conservation, conversion to solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and other expensive unconventional energy sources <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing,</b> because this one industrial project will continue pushing up the atmospheric concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} equivalent greenhouse gases. All the planning and sacrifice {{by the rest of the}} world will be cancelled out by this one industry.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the challenges presented by the complexity of environmental laws at the local level, {{through the use of}} a case study. It documents the important role that comprehensive planning and local regulations play in protecting the natural resources in our communities. In considering 2 ̆ 2 lessons learned, 2 ̆ 2 this article also considers what else is needed to continue protecting the environment at the local level. First, there is an overwhelming need for municipalities to develop a regional strategy to protect their natural resources. Second, local laws play an important role in protecting natural resources. While we often think of the state and federal statutes as being the guardians of our waterways and air, more and more local laws are catching what falls through the cracks of the state and federal system. Third, it is very challenging to be an effective local official. The system is complex; the job requires a tremendous amount of time and dedication, awareness and education. It 2 ̆ 7 s no wonder that many supervisors and mayors run unopposed or that it is difficult to find volunteers to serve on local boards. Fourth, if we don 2 ̆ 7 t focus on supporting the development of local leadership, then all the discussions about local environmental law and smart growth <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing</b> because the ideas will fall on fallow ground. Local officials need training, financial support and enhanced community process, within a regional framework...|$|E
