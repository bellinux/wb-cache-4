5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> to those seen in other flapping theropods, implying {{that they may have}} been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> to turtles.

5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious.

5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E

5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas <b>were</b> <b>similar.</b>|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies <b>were</b> <b>similar,</b> although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the Third Round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Chelsea's matches ranged from comfortable victories to close affairs. They beat Tottenham Hotspur 5–1 in the semi-final, while they beat Queens Park Rangers 1–0 in the Fourth Round. Liverpool's matches <b>were</b> <b>similar,</b> with three ending in a 2–1 scoreline, while the other two against Oldham Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion were won by at least four goals.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s.
