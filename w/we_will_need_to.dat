In this conceptual age, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> foster and encourage right-directed thinking (representing creativity and emotion) over left-directed thinking (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is {{not supported by the}} research data.|$|E
500|$|McLaren team {{principal}} Ron Dennis congratulated Ferrari and Michael Schumacher {{for their}} achievement of clinching the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. Michael Schumacher {{said he hoped}} that his success over the season would commence {{a new era of}} success with the Ferrari team. Similarly, their technical director Ross Brawn said he believed that the team could make further improvements in the following seasons: [...] "We've got to build from this success and I'm sure we will do and get all the support from Italy and Ferrari that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> continue in this vein." [...] Ferrari held an event at the Mugello Circuit in front of 50,000 people where they celebrated their success and thanked the team's fanbase for their continued support. Häkkinen stated that had he not received his stop-and-go penalty, he believed he could have won the race. He added that his car was stationary before the starting procedure was initiated, and admitted that his car moved before the sequence was completed.|$|E

2500|$|Armstrong's {{universals}} are [...] "sparse": {{not every}} predicate {{will have an}} accompanying property, but only those which are deemed basic by scientific investigation. The ultimate ontology of universals would only be realised with the completion of physical science. Mass would thus be a universal (subject to mass not being discarded by future physicists). Armstrong realises that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> refer to and use properties that are not considered universals in his sparse ontology—for instance, being able to refer to something being a game (to use the example from Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations). Armstrong then suggests that a supervenience relation exists between these second order properties and the ontologically authentic universals given to us by physics.|$|E

However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency?

40|$|AbstractLet S and S˜ be {{naturally}} valenced association schemes on sets X and X˜, respectively, and let ϕ be a (combinatorial) morphism from (X,S) to (X˜,S˜). In Xu (2009) [X 2], {{a necessary}} and sufficient condition was given for ϕ to induce an algebra homomorphism from the scheme ring CS to the scheme ring CS˜. The present paper provides new techniques with which this {{result can be}} proved without assuming ker(ϕ) to be finite. To do this, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> first <b>need</b> <b>to</b> prove that for any normal closed subset T of S, whether T is finite or infinite, the quotient S//T is a naturally valenced association scheme on the set X/T. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> discuss scheme ring homomorphisms of naturally valenced association schemes, and prove some isomorphism theorems without assuming the kernels of the scheme ring homomorphisms to be finite. As a direct consequence, for a naturally valenced commutative association scheme S on a set X and any closed subset T of S, the quotient S//T is a naturally valenced commutative association scheme on the set X/T. The approach in this paper is different from Xu (2009) [X 2], and quasi-algebraic morphisms of naturally valenced association schemes are also studied...|$|R
