40|$|We {{introduce}} spectral {{functions that}} capture {{the distribution of}} OPE coefficients and density of states in two-dimensional conformal field theories, and show that nontrivial {{upper and lower bounds}} on the spectral function can be obtained from semidefinite programming. We find substantial numerical evidence indicating that OPEs involving only scalar Virasoro primaries in a c> 1 CFT are necessarily governed by the structure constants of Liouville theory. Combining this with analytic results in modular bootstrap, we conjecture that Liouville theory is the unique unitary c> 1 CFT <b>whose</b> <b>primaries</b> have bounded spins. We also use the spectral function method to study modular constraints on CFT spectra, and discuss some implications of our results on CFTs of large c and large gap, in particular, to what extent the BTZ spectral density is universal.

We define {{a new class of}} local operators in these conformal field theories which are not polynomial in the fundamental fields and create topological disorder. They can be regarded as higher-dimensional analogues of twist and winding-state operators in free 2 d CFTs. We call them monopole operators for reasons explained in the text. The importance of monopole operators is that in the Higgs phase, they create Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. We study properties of these operators in three-dimensional QED using large N_f expansion.

To obtain a comprehensive genomic view of melanoma in humans, we sequenced the genomes of 25 metastatic melanomas and matched germline DNA. A {{wide range of}} point mutation rates was observed: lowest in melanomas <b>whose</b> <b>primaries</b> arose on non-ultraviolet-exposed hairless skin of the extremities (3 and 14 per megabase (Mb) of genome), intermediate in those originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (5 – 55 per Mb), and highest in a patient with a documented history of chronic sun exposure (111 per Mb). Analysis of whole-genome sequence data identified PREX 2 (phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2) —a PTEN-interacting protein and negative regulator of PTEN in breast cancer—as a significantly mutated gene with a mutation frequency of approximately 14 % in an independent extension cohort of 107 human melanomas. PREX 2 mutations are biologically relevant, as ectopic expression of mutant PREX 2 accelerated tumour formation of immortalized human melanocytes in vivo. Thus, whole-genome sequencing of human melanoma tumours revealed genomic evidence of ultraviolet pathogenesis and discovered a new recurrently mutated gene in melanoma.

Assuming that carbon and metals are not present, which spectral classification is seen depends on the effective temperature.

We demonstrate that these monopole operators transform non-trivially under the flavor symmetry group. We also consider topology-changing operators in the infrared limits of N= 2 and N= 4 supersymmetric QED as well as N= 4 SU(2) gauge theory in three dimensions. Using large N_f expansion and operator-state isomorphism of the resulting superconformal field theories, we construct monopole operators that are primaries of short representation of the superconformal algebra and compute their charges under the global symmetries. Predictions of three-dimensional mirror symmetry for the quantum numbers of these monopole operators are verified. Furthermore, we argue that some of our large-N_f results are exact. This implies, in particular, that certain monopole operators in N= 4 3 -D SQED with N_f= 1 are free fields. This amounts to a proof of 3 -D mirror symmetry in these special cases. ...|$|R

5|$|South of the Eagle Nebula on {{the border}} with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis, <b>whose</b> <b>primary</b> is a white giant that is {{interacting}} with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an accretion disk, {{and was one of the}} first discovered Serpentids, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far-ultraviolet spectral lines.

Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf–Rayet binary CV Serpentis, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.|$|E
