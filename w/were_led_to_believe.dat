5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes on his watch, {{identifying}} {{him as a}} Fulcrum agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset. He reveals that Ned is a Fulcrum agent who caused the disturbance so Mauser could infiltrate the Buy More. At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> They follow the ambulance containing Chuck and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing Chuck to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that Fulcrum will rescue him. To protect Chuck, Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, Chuck watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to Chuck and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, turning away before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and Chuck heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and Chuck believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E

Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} criticised in Israel {{as a show}} trial, {{although}} strict Israeli military censorship of the press, at the time, meant that the Israeli public was {{kept in the dark}} about {{the facts of the case}} and, in fact, <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the defendants were innocent. There were allegations that evidence had been extracted by torture.|$|E
25|$|No {{reliable}} {{tradition has}} been preserved to us regarding the vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper.

25|$|The attack, though {{justified}} by several officials, caused considerable uproar in Germany {{and led to}} the resignation of senior officers and the Minister of Labour Franz-Josef Jung in October 2009. The German officers who orchestrated the bombing were later acquitted of all charges. German courts denied civilian casualties any form of compensation {{on the grounds that the}} involved military personnel <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> by a double agent among the insurgent party that no civilians were present at the scene.|$|E
25|$|According to some, {{his first}} arrest {{was not the}} result of anti-Hasidic {{agitators}} fabricating charges, or officials seeking extortion monies. An accusation was made on May 8, 1798 by Hirsh ben David of Vilna accused him of trying to assist the French Revolution, by sending money to Napoleon and the Sultan. Since this Hirsch ben David was untraceable, some <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that there was no such person as Hirsh and the authorities were attempting to stir up internecine fighting among the Jews.|$|E
25|$|In Medina {{there was}} a busy trade in the sewing {{machines}}, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while {{it was reported that}} others had resorted to theft, with two tailors' shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen. At other locales, there were rumors that a Kuwait-based multinational had been buying up the Singer machines, while in Al-Jouf, the residents <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a local museum was buying up any such machines that it could find, and numerous women appeared at the museum offering to sell their Singer machines.|$|E

25|$|What did {{not break}} down was communication. Operationally, the air {{division}} and corps headquarters were placed alongside, and moved with, army equivalents. The air liaison teams attached to the corps and Panzer Divisions were directed to report the battle situation at the front, but were forbidden to advise the army, or request air support. The army sent separate reports, under the same conditions. The reports were digested by Kleist and Richthofen's chiefs of staff, and action was or was not taken with mutual agreement. Attack orders could be delivered in minutes to air units. A Gruppe (Group) of Ju 87s and Bf 109s was ready in reserve to respond, and could do so within 45 to 70 minutes. Fliegerkorps VIII and Richthofen <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they would spend the entire campaign supporting Reichenau in northern Belgium, but the OKL did not inform the Corps {{that it was going}} to be used in a Meuse river breakthrough.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Gowron {{journeys}} to the station, {{hoping to}} get Worf to argue {{on behalf of the}} Klingons. He does not take Worf's refusal well, and reinstates his discommendation (this time also executing the consequential removing of the House of Mogh from the High Council, seizing the Houses' assets, lands and titles, meaning Worf and his kin were made full outcasts). Later in the episode, the USS Defiant is forced to fight several Klingon ships, at a predetermined meeting point in space, to rescue Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) {{and the rest of the}} Detapa Council. The Defiant returns to the station, only to find it surrounded by a fleet of Klingon battleships, led by both General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) and Gowron himself. The Chancellor issues Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) a final ultimatum: turn over Dukat and the Detapa Council, or else. Sisko refuses, warning that the station is not quite as helpless as they <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> However, Gowron attacks Deep Space Nine anyway in an attempt to capture the Detapa Council. A fragile peace is reached by the end of the episode when it is found DS9 is more than capable of defending itself.|$|E

2500|$|Discontent {{related to}} pay had resurfaced in Philadelphia in June 1783.

[...] Pennsylvania President John Dickinson refused to call out the militia (reasoning they might actually support the mutineers), and Congress decided to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey.

2500|$|The genus Syntarsus {{was named}} by Raath in 1969 {{for the type}} species Syntarsus rhodesiensis from Africa, and later applied to the North American Syntarsus kayentakatae. It was renamed by American {{entomologist}} Dr. Michael Ivie (Montana State University of Bozeman), Polish Australian Dr. Adam Ślipiński, and Polish Dr. Piotr Węgrzynowicz (Muzeum Ewolucji Instytutu Zoologii PAN of Warsaw), the three scientists who discovered that the genus name Syntarsus was already taken by a colydiine beetle described in 1869. Many paleontologists {{did not like the}} naming of Megapnosaurus, partially because taxonomists are generally expected to allow original authors of a name to correct any mistakes in their work. Raath was aware of the homonymy between the dinosaur Syntarsus and beetle Syntarsus, but the group who published Megapnosaurus <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Raath was deceased and therefore unable to correct his mistake, and proceeded accordingly. Mortimer (2012) pointed out that [...] "Paleontologists might have reacted more positively if the replacement name (Megapnosaurus) hadn't been facetious, translating to [...] "big dead lizard". Yates (2005) analyzed Coelophysis and Megapnosaurus and concluded that the two genera are almost identical, and suggested that Megapnosaurus was possibly synonymous with Coelophysis. In 2004, Raath co-authored two papers in which he argued that Megapnosaurus (formerly Syntarsus) was a junior synonym of Coelophysis. Megapnosaurus was regarded by Paul (1988) and Downs (2000) as being congeneric with Coelophysis. Then in 1993, Paul suggested that Coelophysis should be placed in Megapnosaurus (then known as Syntarsus) to get around the above-mentioned taxonomic confusion. Downs (2000) examined Camposaurus and concluded that it was a junior synonym of Coelophysis, because of its similarity to some of the Coelophysis Ghost Ranch specimens. However, a reassessment of the Camposaurus holotype by Martin Ezcurra and Stephen Brusatte published in 2011 revealed a pair of autapomorphies in the holotype, indicating that C. arizonensis was not a synonym of C. bauri, although it was a close relative of C. rhodesensis.|$|E
