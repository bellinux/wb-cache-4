6000|$|... "They quiet {{now because}} they think they got us safe; if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away, they rush down upon us; we shoot many, but we all get killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not here}} to quibble with you, Mr. Bass. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it by every {{legitimate}} means, and failed, {{and you know it}} as well as I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Sir Charles Grandison {{business}} {{is done and}} gone. That's what you mean, I suppose? Don't {{you think we should}} find it very heavy if <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently {{the yacht}} came in sight, and <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>to</b> {{put us on}} board; {{but he was too}} weak, and just before Bob saw us he breathed his last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that we {{had better}} watch the race from these railings. Your gown will be spoilt in the crowd if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the paddock, and you {{probably}} wouldn't get anywhere {{in time to see}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down to {{our camp}} now we'll be soaked," [...] said Snap, as they {{gathered}} under the semi-protection of a large hemlock tree. [...] "The underbrush is loaded with water, {{and if there is}} anything I hate it is to have a wet bough slash me in the face or breast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best thing we can do," [...] said Snap, [...] "is to stay around here somewhere and start a good big camp-fire. If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to our camp we may get lost and also take our death of cold. The quicker we start a fire the better it will be for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} she is," [...] {{explained}} Deborah. [...] "She's worked so long she don't know how <b>to</b> rest. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her <b>to</b> lie down for an hour but she wouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{something}} of a sentimentalist; I don't know if you are right or not. When I built Dryholm <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the feeling Langrigg gives one, {{as far as it}} could be expressed by line. But do you like Whitelees?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work afterwards, but Brown had {{unsettled}} {{us for the}} evening.

6000|$|... "And {{that means}} {{that this is not}} a dead end; somewhere behind us this cleft goes on and up. The draught is blowing up, and that is the way we have to go.

6000|$|... "Wait, Jerry," [...] Harry {{shouted to}} the other boat, which was some twenty yards ahead. [...] "The chief thinks they have gone to cut us off {{at the head of}} the cañon, which is likely enough. I don't suppose it is fifty yards wide there, and they will riddle us if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through in daylight. We had better stop and have a meal and talk it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{repairing}} slip is {{up at the}} top by the foundry," [...] he said. [...] "I {{expect the}} brigantine to starboard has a rope out. If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across, we might make a splash. If we go the other side, we'll pass close under the steamer's rail. She's a pretty big boat; they'll have a Sereno on board, and keep harbor watch. If somebody hailed us, it might bring the port-guard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Car broke down; <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across," [...] Jake replied. [...] "Saw the Langrigg hill when {{we started}} and then the fog came on. They told us to head for some stake-nets, but we couldn't find them. Then we met the water and {{reckoned}} we were lost. Is your punt about?" ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the efforts}} for rationalizing the {{production}} of peanuts in Spain, one of the objectives was to obtain a well adapted variety, suitable for mechanization. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> information on the characteristics that would condition the suitability of a variety to mechanized production, principally mechanical harvesting. All the characters studied would then {{be taken into account}} in a breeding program...|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Iommi {{admitted}} to Guitar World: [...] "Black Sabbath fans generally dont {{like much of}} Technical Ecstasy. It was really a no-win situation for us. If we had stayed the same, people would have said we were still doing the same old stuff. So <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little more technical, and it just didn’t work out very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} that doesn't mind us," [...] he resumed presently. [...] "It isn't what <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that we get, it isn't the good {{we think we}} do is good. What makes us happy isn't our trying, what makes others happy isn't our trying. There's a sort of character people like and stand up for and a sort they won't. You got {{to work it out}} and take the consequences.... Miriam was always trying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{very first}} thing {{we ought to do}} when we get started is to have that hall painted," [...] said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall, a rather shabby {{building}} set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides. [...] "It's a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down. Father says we'll never succeed in DOING that. Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we fight," [...] said Tom, {{with quite}} as much {{composure}} as his commander manifested, [...] "we shall be taken or sunk; if we land, sir, I shall be taken for one man, as I never could make any headway on dry ground; and if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the wind of him by pulling under the cliffs, we shall be cut off by a parcel of lubbers that I can see running along their edges, hoping, I dare say, that they shall {{be able to get}} a skulking shot at a boat's crew of honest seafaring men." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dunaway {{recalled}} the album sessions {{as being very}} difficult. “The problems on that album were that we could tell that everything was being pulled out from underneath us. As hard as <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back <b>to</b> where it once was, we had that sinking feeling going on. We wanted to rekindle what the band was about but there {{was just too much}} exhaustion by then.” ...|$|R
5000|$|This entire ghetto was {{producing}} fur coats, dresses, and the like. Whenever <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{at it in}} the past we were told: Stop! Armaments factory! Of course, {{this has nothing to do}} with Party Comrade Speer. It wasn't your doing. It is this portion of alleged armaments factories that Party Comrade Speer and I intend to clear out in the next few weeks.|$|R
60|$|It was in vain that <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him. Kicks and cuffs, even, were at last resorted to; but, {{though he}} howled like one possessed, {{he would not}} go away, but still haunted us. At last, we conjured the natives to rid us of him; but they only laughed; so {{we were forced to}} endure the {{dispensation}} as well as we could.|$|R
6000|$|... "What we must do, {{when we get}} to {{the other}} side, must depend upon where we land. I mean, whether <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{straight}} in by boat, or to wait about until a chance comes. Once over there, you will have to pretend to be deaf and dumb; and then you can dress up as a Spanish girl--of course, a peasant--which will be much more pleasant than going about as a boy, and better in lots of ways. So if I were you, I should take a bundle of things with me, so that we should have nothing to buy there. It is all very well buying disguises for myself, but I could never go into a shop to ask for all sorts of girls' clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{many houses}} now have character-personality? Most people let the {{different}} dealers choose for them, as it is. Why {{not let the}} Standard Household-Effect Company, and finally the state? I am sure that either would choose much more wisely than people choose for themselves, in the few cases where they even seem to choose for themselves. In most interiors the appointments are without fitness, taste, or sense; they are the mere accretions of accident in the greater number of cases; where they {{are the result of}} design, they are worse. I see what you mean by character and personality in them. You mean the sort of madness that let itself loose a few years ago in what was called household art, and has since gone to make the junk-shops hideous. Each of the eternal-womanly was supposed suddenly to have acquired a talent for decoration and a gift for the selection and arrangement of furniture, and each began to stamp herself upon our interiors. One painted a high-shouldered stone bottle with a stork and stood it at the right corner of the mantel on a scarf; another gilded the bottle and stood it at the left corner, and tied the scarf through its handle. One knotted a ribbon around the arm of a chair; another knotted it around the leg. In a day, an hour, a moment, the chairs suddenly became angular, cushionless, springless; and the sofas were stood across corners, or parallel with the fireplace, in slants expressive of the personality of the presiding genius. The walls became all frieze and dado; and instead of the simple and dignified ugliness of the impersonal period our interiors abandoned themselves to a hysterical chaos, full of character. Some people had their doors painted black, and the daughter or mother of the house then decorated them with morning-glories. I saw such a door in a house I looked at the other day, thinking I might hire it. The sight of that black door and its morning- glories made me wish to turn aside and live with the cattle, as Walt Whitman says. No, the less <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> personality and character into our household effects the more beautiful and interesting they will be. As soon as we put the Standard Household-Effect Company in possession and render it a relentless monopoly, it will corrupt a competent architect and decorator in each of our large towns and cities, and when you hire a new house these will be sent to advise with the eternal-womanly concerning its appointments, and tell her what she wants, and what she will like; for at present the eternal womanly, as soon as she has got a thing she wants, begins to hate it. The company's agents will begin by convincing her that she does not need half the things she has lumbered up her house with, and that every useless thing is an ugly thing, even in the region of pure aesthetics. I once asked an Italian painter if he did not think a certain nobly imagined drawing-room was fine, and he said 'SI. Ma troppa roba.' There were too many rugs, tables, chairs, sofas, pictures; vases, statues, chandeliers. 'Troppa roba' is the vice of all our household furnishing, and it will be the death of the eternal-womanly if it is not stopped. But the corrupt agents of a giant monopoly will teach the eternal-womanly something of the wise simplicity of the South, and she will end by returning to the ideal of housekeeping as it prevails among the Latin races, whom it began with, whom civilization began with. What of a harmless, necessary moth or two, or even a few fleas?" ...|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 Premier League season, Barton was {{not given}} a squad number by QPR. Towards {{the end of the}} season, however, {{chairman}} Tony Fernandes identified the loss of Barton as a factor in the club's poor performance and relegation from the Premier League, saying: [...] "We missed Joey.

50|$|The {{fact that}} in the end we know nothing is just a logical {{consequence}} of Cimrman's externism.

5000|$|On 5 November 2009, Arsenal {{confirmed}} that Mérida had verbally agreed {{a deal with}} the club, but it had yet to be signed.

[...] "The difference is that we do not do what is not allowed by the law. <b>We</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best players everywhere when it is allowed by the rules." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; but there's a {{difference}} between {{that and the other}} thing. It's the needless waste of life and talent that annoys me. On the frontier, we spent men freely, so <b>to</b> speak, because <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something in return--a rebel hill fort seized, a raid turned back. If Benson had killed himself in breaking a horse, or by an accident with a harvesting machine, one couldn't complain; but to see him do so with whisky is another matter." ...|$|R
