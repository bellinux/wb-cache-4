5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
25|$|The Ho Chi Minh Trail {{was the key}} to the Second Indochina War. North Vietnam's People's Army of Vietnam {{depended}} on that logistics route to defeat South Vietnam. As a result, during 1969 and 1970, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) urged its guerrilla battalions to raid the Trail to disrupt or interdict the supply lines. Eventually, the South Vietnamese launched Operation Lam Son 719 on 8 February 1971 in a failed incursion to cut the Trail. The South Vietnamese failure to sever those lines of communications did not end ground assaults on the Trail. Indeed, Operation Desert Rat <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Act was {{intended}} to curb the cost of poor relief, and address abuses of the old system, prevalent in southern agricultural counties, by enabling a new system to be brought in under which relief would only be given in workhouses, and conditions in workhouses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> as to deter any but the truly destitute from applying for relief. The Act was passed by large majorities in Parliament, {{with only a few}} Radicals (such as William Cobbett) voting against. The act was implemented, but the full rigours of the intended system were never applied in Northern industrial areas; however, the apprehension that they would be was a contributor to the social unrest of the period.|$|E

Richard has commented, [...] "although it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever...

500|$|Though tiki bars {{in general}} {{declined}} in {{popularity in the}} late 1970s and 1980s until {{the revival of the}} style in the 1990s, the Sip 'n Dip survived with few changes. [...] During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a [...] "fun factor." [...] It began with a single [...] "mermaid" [...] in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995. [...] Today, [...] Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and said, [...] "I never in my life believed the mermaid attraction <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a big hit.

[...] The song {{was intended to be}} released as the fourth single off Music but Warner Bros., Madonna's recording company, wanted [...] "Amazing" [...] to be the next single. Madonna felt that [...] "Amazing" [...] was too similar to her previous single [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] (1999), and wanted the more eclectic and futuristic [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] so they were in a deadlock.|$|E

500|$|If The Good Wife had {{not been}} {{successful}} and the first season was not renewed beyond its first 13 episodes, creators Robert and Michelle King planned to end their final episode with {{a scene in which}} Peter returns home and greets his emotionally conflicted wife; because the season was continued, it ultimately became the opening scene of [...] "Bang". Robert King said he considered using it as a final scene because, [...] "You would never have wanted to end it where it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a conclusion that everyone’s satisfied, because that’s not Alicia’s life.

500|$|At the Labour {{conference in}} September 2013, Miliband {{highlighted}} his party's {{stance on the}} NHS and announced if elected Labour would abolish the bedroom tax. The conference included several 'signature' policies, such as strengthening the minimum wage, freezing business rates, building 200,000 houses a year, lowering the voting age to 16, {{and the provision of}} childcare by primary schools between 8am and 6pm. The policy that attracted the most attention was the commitment to help tackle the 'cost-of-living crisis' by freezing gas and electricity prices until 2017 to give time to 'reset the market' in favour of consumers. In January 2014 Miliband extended the concept of reform to include the 'big five' banks, in addition to the 'big six' utility companies, and discussed the impact of the cost-of-living on the 'squeezed middle' saying [...] "the current cost-of-living crisis is not just about people on tax credits, zero-hour contracts and the minimum wage. It is about the millions of middle-class families who never dreamt that life <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a struggle".|$|E
500|$|On Friday morning 21 June, seven {{prisoners were}} brought to the bar on a similar charge as on Tuesday (breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and {{stealing}} personal property and money). The prisoners all pleaded not guilty. Mr Gurney addressed the jury explaining that these were the same persons indicted on Tuesday for the same offence. He explained to the jury that the earlier indictment incorrectly described the house to be the property of Rebecca Waddelow, leading to the prisoners' acquittal. He also explained that in the original indictment, other persons had been charged, but as these other persons had since been convicted of capital offences, they had been removed from the indictment. The witness were all brought forward again and made their statements. They said much the same as previously, though this took much of the day. In summing up, Mr Abbott went on a length closing with [...] "the duty which it belonged to them [...] to execute – confident that, from experience which the court had now of them, their verdict <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> as good sense would dictate, and the public justice of the country require". It took the jury fiveminutes to find Walker, Butcher and Crow guilty and Nicholas, Wilson and Jefferson not guilty.|$|E

500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F. Paskell (18661951), in his later style, used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling. George McConnell (18521929) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings. Edward Hill often created a canopy-like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate {{the focus of a}} painting, a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude. [...] Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry (18131891) included dogs, people on horseback, and women and men in red clothing. Francis Seth Frost (18251902) was known to use small figures, wispy clouds, and an oval format. Alfred Thompson Bricher (18371908) was known for his quiet, calm water. Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch. John White Allen Scott (1815–1907) frequently painted passing storm clouds in his skies. Frank Henry Shapleigh had his own primitive style and used the same [...] "props" [...] {{over and over again in}} his paintings. [...] He is known for painting landscapes as seen from the inside of a house or barn looking out through an open door or window.

2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled.

2500|$|In a {{piece for}} TheBlaze, a variety of {{religious}} scholars condemn {{the idea that the}} Bible supported rape. They write that the rape discussed in Deuteronomy was not criminal rape, that a woman could opt out of marrying her rapist, and that the law was created to protect the woman. “His act has rendered her unacceptable as a wife for others. [...] "So this law was designed to indicate responsibility in the sex act for the person in a patriarchal context where women had little power and where the women if left to the event would be on her own.” Richard M. Davidson regarded Deuteronomy 22:28-29 as a law concerning statutory rape. He argued that the laws do support {{the role of women in}} the situation, writing, [...] "even though the woman apparently consents to engage in sexual intercourse with the man in these situations, the man nonetheless has 'afflicted/humbled/violated her'. The Edenic diving design that a woman's purity be respected and protected has been violated. [...] Even though the woman may have acquiesced to her seducer, nonetheless according to the law, the dowry is 'equal to the bride wealth for virgins' (Exodus 22:16): she is treated financially as a virgin <b>would</b> <b>be!</b> <b>Such</b> treatment upholds the value of a woman against a man taking unfair advantage of her, and at the same time discourages sexual abuse." [...] Regarding 22:25-27, Craig S. Keener noted that [...] "biblical law assumes [...] innocence without requiring witnesses; she does not bear the burden of proof to argue that she did not consent. If the woman might have been innocent, her innocence must be assumed," [...] while Davidson added, [...] "Thus the Mosaic law protects the sexual purity of a betrothed woman (and protects the one to whom she is betrothed), and prescribing the severest penalty to the man who dares to sexually violate her." ...|$|E
