5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{an organ}} built by John Loosemore was installed, {{at a cost}} of £100. This was {{converted}} from a single-manual to two-manual operation in the 1830s.

5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
5|$|On the eve {{of their}} reunion, the Companions {{discover}} that the village <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> meeting has {{been taken over by}} a religious order called the Seekers.

5|$|Overdifferentiation is when phonemic distinctions from one's primary {{language}} are {{imposed on the}} sounds of the second system <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not required; underdifferentiation of phonemes occurs when two sounds of the second system are not maintained because they are not present in the primary system.|$|E

5000|$|As {{functions}} evolve, {{they may}} become suitable for inlining <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not before, or no longer suitable for inlining <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> before.

5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{replication}} is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The {{enzymes that}} copy RNA to new RNA, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, {{are also found}} in many eukaryotes <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> involved in RNA silencing.|$|E
5|$|RSTs {{may also}} have a public health benefit. In {{addition}} to undesirable side-effects in the individual, inappropriate antibiotic use is thought {{to contribute to the}} development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. By helping to identify bacterial infection, RSTs may help to limit the use of antibiotics in viral illnesses, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not beneficial.|$|E
