5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds have returned to the planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, {{felt about}} Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November, {{the details}} of the bill to change the {{constitution}} were agreed, but four other issues remained open. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> the talks were going, Chamisa stated that the glass was either half-full or half-empty, depending on the point of view. In the 30 November edition of The Sunday Mail, Chinamasa said that the negotiators had prepared the text for this amendment, but that it still needed to be approved by the leaders on both sides.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|E
25|$|Musicians {{were free}} to join in, but such collaborations were often {{short-lived}} if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to stop playing. Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> he liked the music he said they went on too long.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} opinion poll in 2002 (again {{carried out by}} MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of {{returning}} the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%.|$|E

25|$|Van Vliet {{used the}} ensuing publicity, {{particularly}} with a 1970 Rolling Stone interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate {{a number of}} myths that were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor {{the members of the}} Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band. Last, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.|$|E

Nearly 70 percent back the Pakistani military pursuing Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in the Tribal Areas. According to a survey, <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> the Federally Administered Tribal Areas should be governed, 79 percent said it should be governed by the Pakistani military.|$|E

The show's Twitter and Facebook feeds also showcase Chef and Kohama's love of food by way of pictures of their meals at various shops, stands, and restaurants.

25|$|This {{distinction}} had {{implications for}} New Divinity preaching and evangelism that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing {{the means of}} grace (prayer, seeking God, reading the Bible, and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and love for Christ and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately because everyone had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, they said, to wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little {{difference between the two}} approaches. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.|$|E
