50|$|It was {{discovered}} that Tarski-like semantics for intuitionistic logic were not possible to prove complete. However, Robert Constable has shown that a weaker notion of completeness still holds for intuitionistic logic under a Tarski-like model. In this notion of completeness we are concerned not <b>with</b> all of <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> are true of every model, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> are true {{in the same way}} in every model. That is, a single proof that the model judges a formula to be true must be valid for every model. In this case, there is not only a proof of completeness, but one that is valid according to intuitionistic logic.|$|R

25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject.

He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery.

Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Sexualy {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and AIDS are {{the most}} common diseases worldwide. Women are more affected by STIs and AIDS due to gender-related factors such as biological, cultural and so on. This study was conducted to investigate knowledge about AIDS and STIs among married women in Kohgilouyeh & BoyerAhmad Province/Iran. Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the urban areas of Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad province. Using stratifed cluster sampling, a valid questionnaire covering demographic variables and items related to knowledge about AIDS and STIs was administered to 1379 women covered by the urban PHC clinics. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 33. 3 (SD=± 9. 3). Most were household (% 85) and the mean level of their formal education was 7. 2 years (SD=± 4. 8). The results also showed that women had <b>the</b> most knowledge <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> "using condom protects against AIDS" (% 63. 9) and "asymptomatic persons would be as AIDS vectors" (% 65. 1). There was a significant relation between education and recognizing AIDS as a sexualy transmitted infection (p= 0. 004). Albeit, women were poorly familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> STIs, the most knowledge was found with gonorrhea (% 40. 5) and <b>the</b> least <b>with</b> chlamydia (% 12. 2). The most knowledge was observed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> "STIs would induce PID in women" and "using condom protects against all the venereal diseases" (both % 61. 1). A significant corelation was found between education and job and fimiliarity with STIs (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Findings showed limited knowledge on sexualy transmitted infections and fairely good knowledge on AIDS. There is need for the promotion of women's knowledge in sexual health field...|$|R

He uses the term [...] "rhizomatic" [...] to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements; he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions, and that they exhibit a greater understanding of the utility of force. Rather than being part of a recognisable army, the fighters are part of the civilian population, and their objectives are more political than military—they seek to [...] "win hearts and minds" [...] rather than take or hold territory.
