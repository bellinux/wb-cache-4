50|$|End {{terminals}} (wire ferrules) {{are used}} to protect the stripped ends of stranded wires {{so that they can}} be connected to terminals without damage to individual wires. When using certain clamp types, such as the lift terminals, no <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> ferrules are required.|$|E
50|$|A swageless {{terminal}} can {{be removed}} and re-used, unlike a swaged terminal. This makes them very popular in the marine industry as they enable a quick repair {{to be made to}} a damaged cable while out at sea. Removing them from the <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> also allows anything which the cable has been threaded through (headstay furler) to be removed for servicing, re-threaded and the fitting re-attached.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods to}} prevent fraying include soft or silver {{soldering}} the <b>wire</b> <b>ends,</b> or ideally by flash cutting the wires.|$|R
50|$|Jump wires (also called jumper wires) for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> Jump <b>wire</b> material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> The <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|R
50|$|The line is {{primarily}} operated by NSW TrainLink V sets. Modern H sets (OSCARs) also {{operate on the}} line as far as Springwood. As the electric overhead <b>wiring</b> <b>ends</b> at Lithgow, diesel-electric Endeavour railcars operate the services to and from Bathurst.|$|R
5000|$|Crimp {{contacts}} are {{assembled by}} inserting a stripped <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> into a cavity {{in the rear}} of the contact, then crushing the cavity using a crimp tool, causing the cavity to grip the wire tightly at many points. The crimped contact is then inserted into the connector where it locks into place. Individual crimped pins can be removed later by inserting a special tool into the rear of the connector.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{construction}} tolerances, {{a means of}} adjustment, or regulation, of the action has to be provided. This is commonly done by having a threaded <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> on the wooden tracker rods. A circular nut varies the effective length of the tracker where it engages with {{other parts of the}} action. One objective of correct regulation is that the keys on each manual have the same rest height and distance of travel when pressed. The regulation wrongly set at one extreme can cause a note to sound when no keys are pressed. This may also be caused by the action sticking after the key is released. The other extreme is that notes do not sound, or sound feebly, when a key is pressed.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device {{for the production}} of flexible electrical stranded wires cut to length and prefabricated for assembly, whereby the stranded wires are wrapped by a common insulation sheath. The stranded wires are stripped at the stranded <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> by a stripping unit, twisted and then welded rigidly together by an ultrasound welding unit. The ultrasound welding unit and the stripping unit are combined in one unit. The stripping unit is assigned a sensor and the entire device is coordinated by an electric control. Welding of the stranded <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> is performed without the supply of additional materials such as solder and without the use of separately produced parts such as <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> sleeves or other terminal parts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- An {{approach}} {{based on}} Prony's method {{is used to}} find the spatial poles of straight wires of varying length and radius from the far-field patterns. For the antenna case, poles having the largest residues are found near the feed region and antenna ends; smaller ones are found outside these regions. The poles are attributed to radiation from the exciting source and <b>wire</b> <b>ends,</b> due to charge acceleration, and from a slightly damped traveling wave. In the scattering case, the poles with the largest residues are located at the <b>wire's</b> <b>ends</b> for near-axial incidence and are again due to end radiation. By examining the residue magnitudes {{as a function of}} wire radius, a correlation is found with radiation from the feed region of an infinite antenna and from the ends of a semi-infinite antenna. 1...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{response}} measurements by {{the current}} injection technique of hot-wire anemometers at very low overheat ratios, show that for <b>wires</b> with substantial <b>end</b> conduction losses, a single time constant system response is not obtained. This is contrary to currently used theoretical models. A new model is presented which successfully simulates the measured frequency response characteristics. It is concluded that the traditional assumption of constancy of temperature at the <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> under dynamic conditions is incorrect. Hot-wires with negligible end conduction losses were found to give the anticipated single time constant system response...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{propagation of}} plasmons in single crystalline silver nanostructures fabricated {{using a combination}} of a bottom-up and a top-down approach. Silver nanoplates of thickness around 65 nm and a surface area of about 100 μ m^ 2 are made using a wet chemical method. Silver nanotips and nanowires are then sculptured by focused ion beam milling. The plasmons are excited by using the fluorescence from the redeposited silver clusters during the milling process. Propagation of plasmons in the nanowires is observed in the visible spectral region.

40|$|Lecordier, jc dupont, a gajan, p paranthoen, pIt {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that the frequency response of cold wires used to measure a turbulent temperature field can be noticeably attenuated because of thermal inertia of the <b>wire,</b> <b>end</b> conduction heat loss between wire and prongs, and spatial resolution. The correction of temperature signals is, therefore, indispensable. The transfer functions of cold wires have been determined by using a home-made dynamic calibration system. A theoretical analysis is used {{to take into account}} spatial resolution. The proposed method of correction for temperature fluctuation spectra and RMS intensity accounting for these three effects is applied to the determination of temperature variance profile in the heated wake of a line source in a turbulent boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostatic {{interactions}} between two end-to-end Permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) nanowires {{have been studied}} {{as a function of}} their separation, end shape, and width. The change in switching field increases as the wires become closer, with deviations from the switching field of an isolated wire of up to 40 % observed. The sign of the change depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the two wires, with higher fields for parallel magnetization and lower fields for antiparallel magnetization. A <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> shape has a strong influence, with larger field variations being seen for flat-ended wires than wires with tapered ends. The micromagnetic modeling and experiments performed here were in good qualitative agreement.

40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} and domain structure were investigated for die-drawn and subsequently annealed Fe-Si-B amorphous wires. It {{was found that}} the die-drawn wire has bamboo domain {{similar to that of the}} Co based wire with negative magnetostriction and looses the re-entrant flux reversal characteristic. It was also found that the wire recovers the re-entrant characteristic after annealing. The tension-annealed wire has clear shell and core domain structure and exhibits the re entrant characteristic with enhanced remanence. The surface bamboo domain layer as thin as 5 mu m was connected to the core domain by magnetization that changes direction continuously between two domains without domain wall. From the temperature dependence of a threshold field for the discontinuous flux jump, it is inferred that the re entrant characteristic is caused by the depinning of the reverse domain existing near the <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> due to demagnetizing effect...|$|E
40|$|Photonic {{integrated}} circuits are an enabling technology in modern communications systems. The continually increasing demands for higher-speed and lower operating power devices {{have resulted in}} the continued impetus to shrink photonic components. In this work, we demonstrate a primitive nanophotonic integrated circuit element composed of a single silver nanowire and single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) flake. We show that nanowire plasmons can excite MoS 2 photoluminescence via direct plasmon-to-exciton conversion along the wire and plasmon-to-photon-to-exciton conversion at the MoS 2 -covered <b>wire</b> <b>end.</b> We also find that the reverse process is possible: MoS 2 excitons can decay into nanowire plasmons that can then be routed via the nanowire on-chip. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanowire may serve the dual purpose of both exciting MoS 2 photoluminescence via plasmons and recollecting the decaying excitons.

40|$|The {{emission}} spectrum of individual single crystalline ZnO nanowires shows three regimes characterized by distinct polarization properties and spatial emission patterns {{along the length}} of the wire. In the visible range below 2. 9 eV, emission is polarized along the long axis of the wire, along the c-axis (E//c). In the second regime between 2. 9 and 3. 22 eV, Fabry-Prot guided modes polarized perpendicular to the wire (Ec) prevail. From their dispersion, it is clear that these modes signify strong coupling between the B-exciton and linearly polarized transverse electric modes that are guided by the wire and trapped between the <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> facets. The third regime is characterized by uniform emission along the wire and a marked dip in the polarization at around the electronic band gap at 3. 3 eV. Lasing is observed only in the second regime in which strong light-matter interaction prevails...|$|E
