60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> camp we {{were told}} that the half of our soldier-crab baits had been sucked off by bonefish. Did not believe that.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{the tomb}} in the deep, dead stillness that {{followed}} the storm, the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away. They were waiting for our return. Saumarez most of all.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{handful of}} marauders," [...] replied Kadour ben Saden. [...] "They {{attacked}} {{two of our}} number who had dropped behind, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> them the fellows soon dispersed. They left two dead. None of my party was injured." ...|$|E
60|$|RUFIO. I {{hope you}} will have {{the good sense to}} follow your own advice <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Rome, Caesar.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will find}} {{her at the}} tea-table, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the drawing-room. Girls are out of place at dinner-parties." [...] So he {{answered}} me--not very graciously.|$|R
6000|$|Thy little {{footsteps}} on the sands Of a remote and lonely shore; The twinkling of thine infant hands, Where now the worm will feed no more; Thy mingled look of love and glee [...] 5 <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> gaze on thee-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} after {{a tour of}} the block, we saw Kendricks in our corner of the {{verandah}} with Miss Gage. They were both laughing convulsively, and they ran down to meet us in yet wilder throes of merriment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{only is it}} {{our right}} to bend every effort to escape--it is a solemn duty from which we should not shrink even though {{we know that we}} should be reviled and {{tortured}} by our own peoples <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{soon as we}} get to town we can get {{cleaned up}} a little better," [...] said Dave. [...] "So we won't look quite like tramps <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not {{let them}} steal anything," [...] said the explorer, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> civilization you shall be richly rewarded. I {{will give you a}} boat, a gun, and a hunting knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall do well enough," [...] Margaret said cheerfully, [...] "and maybe I shall get so fond {{of court}} {{that you will have}} to take me to that of Henry <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{was enough}} to whet my curiosity, and I favored Miss Brown {{with more than one}} glance during dinner. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the parlor car I took {{advantage}} of the opportunity and remarked to Henderson that he might introduce his manager. He complied, but not with amiable grace.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the Avenger {{after our}} round of visits, we found Jim Freeman {{and his friends}} keeping ship in great style. They were looking as proud as peacocks, and I failed to {{understand}} the meaning of it all, for ordinarily they were meek lads, until Jim whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|Olson, Whitely, Wilson, and I {{stood for}} a moment looking at one another. It seemed {{incredible}} that man could be so perfidious--that we had really seen with our own eyes the thing that we had seen; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the fort, the shattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no mistake.|$|E
6000|$|The moon is up; by Heaven {{a lovely}} eve! [...] Long streams of light, o'er glancing waves expand, [...] Now lads on shore may sigh and maids believe: [...] Such be our fate <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> land! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my lord,' said Lady Annabel, 'both Venetia {{and myself}} are much engaged now; and I {{do not wish}} her to read while she is in London. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Cherbury she will have {{abundance}} of time, if desirable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust it}} will, Jack; I hope, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> New York, {{to see you}} among us, anchored, as you would call it, {{for the rest of}} your days under my aunt's roof, or under my own, should I ever have one." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the inn, {{we ordered}} supper {{to be ready}} by eight o'clock, that we might drink a parting glass to settle it, before we went on board; for my husband, who knew the sea very well, said a full stomach was the forerunner of sea-sickness, which I was willing to avoid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{we always}} speak English at home. Our father made {{a rule that}} we should always do so; {{as he said it}} would be an immense {{disadvantage}} to us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> England, if we had the slightest French accent. Our mother now speaks English as purely and correctly as our father." ...|$|E
60|$|So we {{went about}} Venice {{tracking}} down pictures and spiral staircases and such-like things, and my brains were busy {{all the time}} with such things as a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, New York, with the elaboration of schemes of action <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> London, with the development of a theory of Margaret.|$|E

50|$|His current {{research}} interests {{focus on the}} toxic effects of inhaled dusts to include carbon nanotubes, which are useful in making high-strength and light-weight materials, and lunar dust, which could be a health problem <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the moon for good. He and his team are developing differential mobility spectrometry for applications to spacecraft air quality monitoring.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{the shore}} and related to our friend what had passed, he was greatly distressed, and groaned in spirit; but we had not sat long in {{conversation}} when we were interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Tararo on the beach, accompanied by a number of followers bearing baskets of vegetables and fruits on their heads.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Warren's rooms, {{the gloom}} of a London winter evening had {{thickened}} into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour, {{broken only by the}} sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{afternoon}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the city, and we recommenced {{the campaign}} by a sumptuous lunch, {{during which the}} broker came in. [...] "I've been offering Territories until I'm hoarse," [...] he said. [...] "There was some surprise and talking, but nobody wanted to buy; and, while it's an honor to serve you, I don't see much of a commission in this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} my news will not {{distress}} you. You realized, of course, that your decision to remain known, or rather unknown, as Kingston Brooks, made it at some time or other inevitable, and I hope to see {{a good deal of}} you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> town, and that you will always believe that I am your most sincere friend, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hans, thou son of Eric," [...] said Fred, {{grasping}} {{the hand of}} his pilot and guide when this was finished. [...] "I like thee, man; thou hast done me good service this day. But for you I should have missed this chance, so I consider myself thy debtor, lad; mark me well, I will discharge this debt <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the south. So now, let us be gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most unfortunate {{state of}} things, truly," [...] said Fred, laughing. [...] "Perhaps you'll recover <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> low latitudes. If not, {{there are plenty}} lunatic asylums. But we must not spend {{more than a few}} hours longer on this excursion, for I've a notion that we are somewhere about Saturday just now, and you know it's against our rules to run the risk of {{shooting}} or fishing into Sunday." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> camp, Haught and {{his sons}} were there. Even at a {{distance}} their horses, weapons, and persons satisfied my critical eye. Lee Haught was a tall, spare, superbly built man, with square shoulders. He had a brown face with deep lines and sunken cheeks, keen hazel eyes, heavy dark mustache, and hair streaked a little with gray. The only striking features of his apparel were his black sombrero and long spurs.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Florence for the winter, however, I confess I {{began to}} chafe. 'This is slow work, Elsie!' I said. 'I started out to go round the world; {{it has taken}} me {{eighteen}} months to travel no further than Italy! At this rate, I shall reach New York a gray-haired old lady, in a nice lace cap, and totter back into London a venerable crone {{on the verge of}} ninety.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} our agent, who {{appeared}} in an exultant mood, was waiting us, and he positively beamed upon Haldane as he said: [...] "It's an honor {{to work for a}} man with your nerve and judgment, sir, and we have whipped the last grit out of them. I let up altogether when I saw every outside 'bear' come ramping in; and, if you're inclined that way, we might cover a little quietly without stiffening prices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, on the whole, I {{think we}} will try the boat," [...] said Mr. Parkman; [...] "it will be so much more amusing, and we shall see so much more of London life. Besides, we shall often read and hear about the steamers on the Thames <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> America, {{and it will be}} well for us to have made one voyage in them. And, Mr. George, will you go with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll lung up, too," [...] says Tim, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the c. p. George shuts off, the colloids are opened, and {{the fresh}} air sweeps her out. There is no hurry. The old {{contracts}} (they will be revised {{at the end of}} the year) allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind her in ten. So we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which pushes us along at a languid twenty.|$|R

[...] Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand; [...] Now lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe[eg]: [...] Such be our fate <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> land! [...] Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand[eh] [...] Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love; [...] A circle there of merry {{listeners}} stand [...] Or to some well-known measure featly move, [...] Thoughtless, {{as if on}} shore they still were free to rove.|$|R
