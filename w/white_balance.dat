2500|$|In digital photography, {{the term}} color {{temperature}} is sometimes used interchangeably with <b>white</b> <b>balance,</b> which allow a remapping of color values to simulate variations in ambient color temperature. Most digital cameras and RAW image software provide presets simulating specific ambient values (e.g., sunny, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) while others allow explicit entry of <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> values in kelvins. These settings vary color values along the blue–yellow axis, while some software includes additional controls (sometimes labeled [...] "tint") adding the magenta–green axis, and are {{to some extent}} arbitrary and a matter of artistic interpretation.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{video and}} digital still cameras can adjust for color {{temperature}} by zooming {{into a white}} or neutral colored object and setting the manual [...] "white balance" [...] (telling the camera that [...] "this object is white"); the camera then shows true white as white and adjusts all the other colors accordingly. White-balancing is necessary especially when indoors under fluorescent lighting and when moving the camera from one lighting situation to another. Most cameras also have an automatic <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> function that attempts to determine {{the color of the}} light and correct accordingly. While these settings were once unreliable, they are much improved in today's digital cameras and produce an accurate <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> {{in a wide variety of}} lighting situations.|$|E

40|$|When {{rendering}} photographs, it {{is important}} to preserve the gray tones despite variations in the ambient illumination. When the illuminant is known, <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> that preserves gray tones can be performed in many different color spaces; the choice of color space influences the renderings of other colors. In this behavioral study, we ask whether users have a preference for the color space where <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> is performed. Subjects compared images using a <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> transformation that preserved gray tones, but the transformation was applied in one of the four different color spaces: XYZ, Bradford, a camera sensor RGB and the sharpened RGB color space. We used six scenes types (four portraits, fruit, and toys) acquired under three calibrated illumination environments (fluorescent, tungsten, and flash). For all subjects, transformations applied in XYZ and sharpened RGB were preferred to those applied in Bradford and device color space...|$|R
40|$|Color image {{acquisition}} and image processing {{have become a}} key in modern data applications. In order to provide high quality images, the field of accurate acquisition is most important in respect to all further processing steps. This {{is especially true for}} color correction and <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> on color sensors. But a whole variety of current image sensors possess an incorrect color rendition due to insufficient accuracy of optical sensor parameters. In these cases specific color information is incorrectly acquired. Further, traditional color correction and <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> methods do not use information on the specific sensor spectral sensitivity, thus losing the only capable information for a substantial correction. The problem is investigated by introducing an algorithmic correction method which is capable of correcting dysfunctional sensor properties. Further we will show the concept of <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> with multi-channel sensors capable of high quality color rendition presenting examples and simulation results...|$|R

40|$|In a raw {{photographic}} image, {{the observed}} colors are {{a mixture of}} material reflectance and colored illumination. For further processing, the color influence of the light source is often considered a disturbance. In such cases, it is desireable to neutralize {{the color of the}} light source, often referred to as <b>white</b> <b>balancing.</b> Successful <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> often requires an estimate of the color of the light source. Most existing illuminant color estimators assume homogeneous, globally uniform illumination. However, this assumption is often violated in real-world images. In this work, we make an attempt towards estimating the colors and spatial distributions of multiple light sources in a scene. We estimate the color of the illumination locally, and define an objective function to select two or three repre-sentative illuminants from all local estimates. Although the objective function is relatively simple, qualitative results look promising. ...|$|R

40|$|Automatic <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> works {{quite well}} on average, but seriously fails {{some of the}} time. These {{failures}} lead to completely unacceptable images. Can the number, or severity, of these failures be reduced, perhaps {{at the expense of}} slightly poorer <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> on average, with the overall goal being to increase the overall acceptability of a collection of images? Since the main source of error in automatic <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> arises from misidentifying the overall scene illuminant, a new illuminationestimation algorithm is presented that minimizes the high percentile error of its estimates. The algorithm combines illumination estimates from standard existing algorithms and chromaticity gamut characteristics of the image as features in a feature space. Illuminant chromaticities are quantized into chromaticity bins. Given a test image of a real scene, its feature vector is computed, and for each chromaticity bin, the probability of the illuminant chromaticity falling into a chromaticity bin given the feature vector is estimated. The probability estimation is based on Loftsgaarden-Quesenberry multivariate density function estimation over the feature vectors derived from a set of synthetic training images. Once the probability distribution estimate for a given chromaticity channel is known, the smallest interval that is likely to contain the right answer with a desired probability (i. e., the smallest chromaticity interval whose sum of probabilities is greater or equal to the desired probability) is chosen. The point {{in the middle of that}} interval is then reported as the chromaticity of the illuminant. Testing on a dataset of real images shows that the error at the 90 th and 98 th percentile ranges can be reduced by roughly half, with minimal impact on the mean error...|$|R
