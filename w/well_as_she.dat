Shakira's official website first announced the three initial venues of the North American {{leg of the}} tour, on 3 May 2010,< and subsequently 22 more venues were listed. After a special tour preview show held in Montreal, Canada, on 15 September 2010, the North American leg of the tour commenced at Uncasville, Connecticut, on 17 September, and closed at Rosemont, Illinois, on 29 October 2010. The initial dates for the European leg of the tour were announced on 28 June 2010, and subsequently 22 more shows were listed. The European leg of the tour was planned to commence at Lyon, France, on 16 November, and end in London, England, on 20 December 2010. The tickets for the initial dates of the European leg were soon sold out, and Shakira extended the tour into 2011, beginning by announcing a show at Paris, France; venues at countries such as Croatia, Russia, Spain and Switzerland were soon added. The Latin American leg of the tour {{was a part of}} the Pop Festival, which was heralded as an initiative to bring international music stars to Latin America. Initial tour dates for the leg were announced on 3 December 2010, and soon venues at countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico were added to the tour dates.|$|E

25|$|Luciana is Giovanni's {{youngest}} daughter, out of four. At {{thirteen years}} old, {{she is a}} very spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school to find that her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. Entranced by the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is particularly beautiful for her age. Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after she has seen his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E

At the age of 14 years and 41 days she became the youngest-ever female Olympic champion in swimming.

25|$|On 10 January 1957, {{at the age}} of 68, Eliot married Esmé Valerie Fletcher, who was 30. In {{contrast}} to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in a church at 6:15 am with virtually no one in attendance other than his wife's parents. Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the Wesleyan University Press, seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliot's death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. Valerie Eliot died on 9 November 2012 at her home in London.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. <b>Well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Laura Heaps from MyVillage agreed, {{stating that}} the single [...] "just doesn't stand out" [...] and that Stefani [...] "doesn't do hip hop as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does quirky pop", and Playlouder's Richard Smirke {{described}} the track as a [...] "sickly sweet R ballad". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the lyrics [...] "surprisingly sharp"; Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media disagreed, dubbing the song a [...] "soulless Nellee Hooper 90s R vanity affair" [...] and a [...] "zombied buy-LAMB-clothing mantra". In August 2013, Complex magazine placed [...] "Luxurious" [...] at number 19 on its list of [...] "The Best R Songs by White Singers in the 2000s".|$|E

Elysa Gardner of USA Today called [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] an [...] "irresistible power ballad" [...] and recommended readers to purchase the song. A staff writer for Portrait Magazine stated that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was {{a great way to}} end Teenage Dream and that it showcases the singer's voice quite <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has [...] "lyrics to work for instead of ones to just play around with."

500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting was {{nothing short of}} adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was the highlight of [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really much to get all huffy over. You can say this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E
