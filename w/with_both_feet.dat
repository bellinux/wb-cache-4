Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E
5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2010, the 19-year-old Kieftenbeld {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Eredivisie club Groningen, who paid a €300,000 {{fee for the}} player. He was presented as a right back, despite only ever having played in midfield. In his first season at Groningen he did indeed play at right back, competently enough, but in a 5–1 defeat away to Feyenoord, he struggled against Ryo Miyaichi, a player with pace and ability <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> and eventually fouled him to concede a penalty. Groningen finished the season in fifth position, thus qualifying for the play-offs for {{a place in the}} Europa League. Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi-final, so was suspended for the second. He was replaced at half-time in the first leg of the final, which Groningen lost 5–1 to ADO Den Haag, and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four-goal deficit only to lose out on penalties.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{immediately}} guided Palace {{back to the}} Premier League as runaway {{champions of}} the second tier, Chris Armstrong top-scoring with 23 league goals. During this period the badge was changed with the bird being replaced by one which Ron Noades felt more closely resembled an eagle. 1995 again saw the club making news for off the field reasons. On 25 January 1995 Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park. Following a bad tackle on Richard Shaw, United's maverick French forward Eric Cantona was sent off. As Cantona walked towards the tunnel he was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons. This angered Cantona, who launched a flying kick at him <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> Manchester United suspended Cantona {{for the remainder of}} the season, while the French Football Federation dropped Cantona from the France national football team, and stripped Cantona of the captaincy of Les Bleus. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail; this was reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and in 1996 was found guilty of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour towards Cantona. More was to follow at Selhurst in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. In 1995 Palace reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups, but a shortage of Premier League goals counted against them alongside the introduction of a fourth relegation place. The Premiership was being cut from 22 to 20 clubs at the end of the 1994–95 season, and Palace found themselves demoted on the last day of the season once again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Jumping {{is another}} type of motion analysis. We have long jump, triple jump, static jump and leap frog jump. The long jump which athletes combine speed, {{strength}} and agility {{in an attempt to}} land as far from the take-off point as possible. The triple jump occurred when the athlete runs down a runway until he reaches a designated mark, from which the jump is measured. The leap frog jump means jumping by <b>both</b> <b>foots</b> by maintains subjects kneels or bends over for the next jump. The static jump means jumping <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>foots</b> at one place. In this study, we will acquire the force, moment and center of pressure. This experiment will consist of subjects standing on two feet, wearing and not wearing shoes. The comparison will be made between long jump vs triple jump and static jump vs leap frog jump. The experiment was held at Biomechanic and Motion Analysis Laboratory, UniMAP. Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) software been used for this purpose where this software aid us in analyzing motion of the subject as shown in Figure 1. Two Bertec force plate and five high frequency cameras were used to capture the motion of the subjects while doing the experiment. The result shown force exerted at toe will be highest in leap frog jump compare to others...|$|R

50|$|Standing calf raises are {{executed}} <b>with</b> one or <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> They {{are frequently}} {{done on a}} raised surface with the heel lower than the toes to allow a greater stretch on the working muscles.

25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on}} the {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.|$|E
25|$|A {{versatile}} attacker, Ronaldo {{is capable}} of playing on either wing {{as well as through}} the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> He ranks among the world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger {{on the right side of}} midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs that became his trademark.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to creating goals, Gerrard, naturally right footed, {{had the ability}} to score goals due to his striking ability from distance <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> As he entered his mid 30s and his physical capability to get forward and join the attack declined, the number of long range strikes at goal decreased, with most of his goals coming from free kicks and penalty kicks. Renowned for his pace, work-rate and stamina in his prime, his main attributes in his later career were his vision, ball striking, and his accurate, varied passing range, which allowed him to set the tempo of his team's play and create attacking chances from midfield. He also possessed good technical and aerial ability, as well as notable defensive attributes. In particular, Gerrard's tactical intelligence and ability to read the game allowed him to break down the opposition's attacking plays. In {{addition to}} his footballing attributes, Gerrard was highly regarded for his leadership, determination, and influence on the pitch throughout his career. Despite being vocal in his criticism of diving, Gerrard was widely accused of diving himself.|$|E
