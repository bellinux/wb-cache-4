5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, working {{its way through the}} Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, or the fact that they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E
5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E

25|$|The spell, {{intended}} to last only seconds and function {{only within the}} new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread.|$|E
25|$|After a {{prolonged}} absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing {{the concern that}} Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along {{to act as a}} line producer, for the film's problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with Soldadera unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.|$|E

25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg." [...] Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a [...] "sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [...] The men knew <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle." ...|$|E

Needless to say, this got a lot of quizzical replies." [...] Unbeknownst to Falk and Jordan, Nike had decided to target Jordan as their player of the future. [...] Jordan himself was initially reticent; throughout college he had worn Converse because of the company's endorsement deal with Tar Heels coach Dean Smith, and off the court, he wore Adidas. [...] Jordan had never worn or even seen a Nike shoe before the company contacted him.|$|E
500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{phases of}} the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is [...] "a good idea for most entertainment products." [...] Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, [...] "not [...] designers or researchers." [...] At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained {{that the success of}} the series laid in [...] "making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer." [...] Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather [...] "about the human experience;" [...] they focused not simply on what humans had done but on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in the future such as [...] "going into space." [...] Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they [...] "couldn't get away" [...] with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.|$|E

He arranged temporary accommodation for them and collected clothes and food from local charities. His main concern was to provide Jewish refugees with safe passage, using his ability to bribe and charm to obtain exit visas from the Romanian government. He asked for help from the Jewish Agency's leadership in Tel Aviv, {{though there was a}} limit to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> because the British had imposed strict quotas on the number of Jewish refugees allowed into Palestine, causing Kastner to attack [...] "Perfidious Albion" [...] in Új Kelet.|$|E

2500|$|With MTV Games, a {{subsidiary}} of Viacom, Harmonix took their experience from developing Guitar Hero and Karaoke Revolution to create the Rock Band series. According to Harmonix Vice President of Product Development, Greg LoPiccolo, the Harmonix team had already envisioned the possibility of different instruments before they were completed with the Guitar Hero series; Rigopulos noted that the Guitar Hero work was only a partial approach to this, limited to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> on a [...] "shoe-string budget". Harmonix also embraced the idea of Rock Band as a platform rather than a software title, and took steps to incorporate downloadable content to extend players' music libraries without having them need {{to buy a new}} software disk. [...] Rock Band was considered a success, leading to the development of sequels and spinoff titles. Viacom {{under the terms of the}} acquisition, paid out $150M in performance-based bonuses to Harmonix in early 2008 for their 2007 results, and were planning on a similar amount by the end of 2008. The Rock Band series scored what was considered a major coup by journalists when it successfully negotiated the rights to use the music of The Beatles in a video game, long considered a [...] "holy grail" [...] for music games.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to rank-and-file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public show trials. [...] These {{were more likely}} to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the Kremlin or even Stalin, as he had done in the Moscow Trials of the Great Purge in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. They included Koçi Xoxe in Albania and Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria, who were both purged and arrested. After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help. [...] In Romania, Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca were arrested, with Pătrăşcanu being executed. [...] Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary Mátyás Rákosi and his ÁVH head the way the show trial of Hungarian Foreign Minister László Rajk, who was later executed. [...] The Rajk trials led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated high into party ranks, and when a puzzled Rudolf Slánský and Klement Gottwald inquired <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials. The Czechoslovakian party subsequently arrested Slánský himself, Vladimír Clementis, Ladislav Novomeský and Gustáv Husák (Clementis was later executed). Slánský and eleven others were convicted together of being [...] "Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors" [...] in one series of show trials, after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague. By the time of the Slánský trials, the Kremlin had been arguing that Israel, like Yugoslavia, had bitten the Soviet hand that had fed it, and thus the trials took an overtly anti-Semitic tone, with eleven of the fourteen defendants tried with Slánský being Jewish.|$|E
2500|$|Double Fine {{created a}} number of {{internal}} tools and processes {{to help with the}} development of the game, as outlined by executive producer Caroline Esmurdoc. With the focus of the game on Raz as the playable character within a platformer game, the team created the [...] "Raz Action Status Meeting" [...] (RASM). These were held bi-weekly with each meeting focusing on one specific movement or action that Raz had, reviewing how the character controlled and the visual feedback from that so that the overall combination of moves felt appropriate. With extensive use of the Lua scripting language, they created their own internal Lua Debugger nicknamed Dougie, after a homeless man near their offices they had befriended, that helped to normalize their debugging processes and enable third-party tools to interact with the name. With a large number of planned cutscenes, Double Fine took the time to create a cutscene editor so that the scriptwriters could work directly with the models and environments already created by the programmers without requiring the programmer's direct participation. For level design, though they had initially relied on the idea of simply placing various triggers throughout a level to create event, the resulting Lua code was large and bulky with potential for future error. They assigned eight of the game programmers to assist the level developers to trim this code, and instituted an internal testing department to overlook the stability of the whole game which had grown beyond <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> internally. Initially this was formed from unpaid volunteers they solicited on Double Fine's web site, but following the signing of the Majesco publication deal in 2004, they were able to commit full-time staff to this team.|$|E
