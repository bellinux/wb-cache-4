[...] This mobile leapfrogging {{can be attributed to the}} lengthy process and high cost of wired infrastructure implementation. Additionally, as seen in mobile adoption in the Arab States, wired infrastructure that predates mobile technology is often old, outdated, and incapable of data transmission, [...] "the basic requirement for implementing Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) services".|$|E

50|$|Port {{blocking}} {{includes the}} deliberate decision by ISPs to deny onward transmission of traffic, or delivery of traffic, to an intended recipient. ISPs {{do not have}} a legitimate reason to deny onward packet transmission to specific customers of other ISPs. The ISPs have contractually committed to carry any and all packets from the former ISP without regard for the identity and marketplace success of that ISP’s customers (on a first-come, first-served basis). However, an ISP is more likely to have higher incentives for port blocking when the ISP is vertically and horizontally integrated because those integrated companies attempt to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of corporate affiliates. For example, AT&T blocked Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) because the company was concerned that the VoIP service might threaten its wireless and <b>wired</b> <b>telephony</b> service. Thus, an ISP can engage in port blocking for VoIP traffic when giving preference to an affiliated telephone company.|$|E
50|$|High-security alarm {{controls}} use {{current and}} impedance monitoring on the premises, and may {{report to the}} central station via dedicated voice-grade or DC (obsolescent) circuit, or by means of multiple-drop AC grade transmitter (multiplex).Early (c.a. 1980) solid-state alarm controls used shunt switches or momentary closures on the key circuit to arm or disarm the control. Modern controls can use these arming techniques, but more frequently use a keypad which sends operating information to the control. Thus, {{there is no point}} in attacking the keypad, as there is no intelligence in the keypad, it is all located in the control. Also, many controls feature integrated transmitters, using <b>wired</b> <b>telephony</b> or optionally, cellular telephony. These controls also monitor the status of the telephone line, and can be programmed to trip if the telephone line fails (or is cut). The controls which utilize cellular telephony report either periodically or at a pseudo-random interval to the central station, and a failure to report will result in a dispatch.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — ZigBee-style {{networks}} {{began to}} be conceived around 1999, when many installers realized that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth {{were going to be}} unsuitable for many applications. In particular, many engineers saw a need for self-organizing ad-hoc digital radio networks. The real need for mesh has been cast in doubt since that, in particular as mesh is largely absent in the market. The fir stack release is now called ZigBee 2004. The second stack release is called ZigBee 2006, and mainly replaces the MSG/KVP (Message/Key Value Pair) structure used in 2004 with a "cluster library". The 2004 stack is now more or less obsolete. The cellular network was a natural extension of the <b>wired</b> <b>telephony</b> network that became pervasive during the mid- 20 th century. As the need for mobility and the cost of laying new wires increased, the motivation for a personal connection independent of location to that network also increased. ZigBee technology is a low data rate, low power consumption, low cost, wireless networking protocol targeted towards automation and remote control applications. ZigBee looks rather like Bluetooth but is simpler, has a lower data rate and spends most of its time snoozing. ZigBee routing algorithm can be thought of an hierarchical routing strategy with table-driven optimizations applied where possible. The routing layer is said to start with the well-studied public- domain algorithm Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Motorola’s Cluster-Tree algorithm...|$|E

40|$|As the {{telegram}} {{was replaced by}} telephony, so to Voice over IP (VoIP) systems are replacing conventional switched wire telephone devices, these systems rely on Internet connectivity for the transmission of voice conversations. This paper is an outline of ongoing preliminary research into malfeasant VoIP activity on the Internet. 30 years ago PABX systems were compromised by hackers wanting to make long distance calls at some other entities expense. This activity faded as telephony became cheaper and PABX systems had countermeasures installed to overcome attacks. Now the world has moved onto the provision of telephony via broadband enabled Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) this service is now being provided {{as a replacement for}} conventional fixed <b>wire</b> <b>telephony</b> by major telecommunication providers worldwide. Due to increasing bandwidth it is possible for systems to support multiple voice connections simultaneously. The networked nature of the Internet allows for attackers of these VoIP systems to enumerate and potentially attack and compromise a wide range of vulnerable systems...|$|R
40|$|Epidemic Poliomyelitis {{is one of}} the {{diseases}} that emerged as major public health problems during the 20 th century, and can thus be suspected of being caused by artificial electromagnetic waves. Detailed examination reveals that early epidemic outbreaks coincided with changes in emissions of artificial electromagnetic waves, including the intentional emissions of wireless telegraphy and the unintentional emissions of <b>wire</b> <b>telephony.</b> The fundamental change from irregular outbreaks to yearly epidemics in the US also coincided with the onset of wireless voice communications. These facts provide strong support to the idea that epidemic Poliomyelitis was triggered by exposure to electromagnetic waves and had a high degree of sensitivity to exposure. Examination of further evidence reveals that Poliovirus PV 3 is the ancestor of PV 1, PV 2 and two other group C enteroviruses, and that PV 3 was the dominant Poliovirus serotype in 1875, before the onset of most electromagnetic emissions except wire telegraphy. The time coincidences of Poliomyelitis epidemiology and electromagnetic waves emissions, together with the evolution of Poliovirus, bring strong support to the hypothesis that exposure to electromagnetic fields triggered both epidemic Poliomyelitis and the diversification of Poliovirus...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{comparisons}} of electoral variables are made between groups of electronic voting machines and voting centers classified by types of transmissions {{according to the}} volume of traffic in incoming and outgoing data of machines from and toward the National Electoral Council (CNE) totalizing servers. One unexpectedly finds two types of behavior in <b>wire</b> <b>telephony</b> data transmissions and only one type where cellular telephony is employed, contravening any reasonable electoral normative. Differentiation in data transmissions arise when comparing number of incoming and outgoing data bytes per machine against total number of votes per machine reported officially by the CNE. The respective distributions of electoral variables {{for each type of}} transmission show that the groups classified by it do not correspond to random sets of the electoral universe. In particular, the distributions for the NO percentage of votes per machine differ statistically across groups. The presidential elections of 1998, 2000 and the 2004 Presidential Recall Referendum (2004 PRR) are compared according to the type of transmissions in 2004 PRR. Statistically, the difference between the empirical distributions of the 2004 PRR NO results and the 2000 Chavez votes results by voting centers is not significant.

40|$|Historically, <b>wire</b> line <b>telephony</b> access {{networks}} where {{thought to be}} a typical example to justify a "natural monopoly". Only if the state would guarantee keeping the business exclusive to a company holding a license, would it be possible to get an economical return after the huge investments needed to deploy such a network providing universal access. Today, telecommunications infrastructures competition is encouraged throughout Europe. Regulatory authorities, therefore, aim at encouraging deployment of Next Generation Access networks (NGAs) under a competitive market structure, where two or more access loops should be available to most of the customers. However, it is not evident that the economics of such deployments will sustain healthy long term businesses for several operators. The purpose of the current project is to develop a simple model to ascertain how many operators can make a profitable business in a market like Spain, given the current regulatory constraints (January 2009 CMT resolution on NGAs). This model will take into account a set of simple parameters (like the cost of access to infrastructures, ARPU, percentage of homes contracting the service, population density, etc.) to investigate the economical viability of two or more operators deploying NGAs in different areas of the country...|$|R
40|$|The use of fibre will be {{inevitable}} for transporting hundreds of Mb/s {{to and from}} end-users, {{but this does not}} necessary mean that fibre has to be deployed {{all the way up to}} a point into the home. An alternative is bringing fibre up to the Home (Hybrid FttH) and reusing existing <b>telephony</b> <b>wiring</b> for abridging the last 20 - 200 m. A new transmission technique is developed making this possible, G. Fast. We developed a techno-economic model to see whether this technique is feasible from an economic point of view. In this model we introduce a new method to estimate churn rates. We conclude that G. Fast is for most operators economic feasible on the short term, but more important, especially for operators who are limited in deployment of FttH by working capacity, using Hybrid Fibre has a great effect on their market share. Hybrid FttH, using G. Fast, might be the straw that has to be caught by the European telecom operators to survive the competition with the cable TV operators...|$|R

Due to its popularity and increasing of demand, engineers are trying various approaches of improving the process. One of the methods for improving the process is MMSE based Wiener filter. The objective of speech enhancement {{is to improve the}} quality of a speech signal, often degraded by some type of distortion (for example communication channel distortion, additive noise, convolution filtering operation, etc.) The quality of a speech signal is judged, depending on the application, by one or more of the following factors intelligibility, perceptual quality, listener fatigue, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), speech distortion, and (occasionally) recognition accuracy of an automatic speech recognizer. Numerous schemes have been proposed and implemented that perform speech enhancement under various constraints/assumptions and deal with different issues and applications An application of these estimators in an auditory enhancement scheme using the masking threshold of the human auditory system is formulated, resulting in the GMMSE auditory masking threshold (AMT) enhancement method.

40|$|Telecommunication {{technologies}} and networks are constantly changing; {{with the introduction}} of the GSM system the shift from <b>wired</b> to wireless <b>telephony</b> experienced a unique boom. Since then, behaviour and communication needs of users (i. e. subscribers) have undergone rapid changes from initially the need for pure wireless voice transmission to now data and multimedia content traffic. Introduction of the 3 rd Generation (UMTS/IMT 2000) promised the delivery of these services and the integration with the Internet. However, legacy {{technologies and}} networks {{are not likely to be}} replaced soon, the different wireless and wired communication and information infrastructures will co-exist and will have to work, seemingly seamless, together. The here documented research work delivers basic mechanisms supporting this integration, therefore a variety of technologies from different areas, ranging from Software Radio technology to Object-Oriented computing, have been brought together to introduce reconfigurability to mobile communication networks. Distributed object computing technologies are evaluated and their application as signalling and support platforms for reconfigureable systems is shown in different examples. Other novelties are the introduction of a protocol for download of reconfiguration software, from various software sources, these sources include Smart Cards, wired outlets and Over-The-Air. Furthermore, an object-oriented framework for flexible, 'on-the-fly' protocol exchange has been developed; the mechanisms and architecture of this framework are described within this thesis. Combining protocol reconfiguration, software download and distributed platforms and focusing on control and management of reconfiguration have led to the design and definition of a reconfiguration management architecture. Functionality and structure of this architecture are documented, and its single modules are described. Providing means and mechanisms enabling management and control of reconfiguration within reconfigureable mobile communication networks is the purpose of this thesis.
