30|$|Since the {{production}} of Martian stereo topographic products was proved successful, the system developed {{in this study is}} further proposed as the prototype system capable of processing planetary data possessing the same kind of data hierarchy. For example, lunar surface covered by Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), image data acquired by Lunar Reconnaissance orbiter (LRO) <b>Wide</b> <b>Angle</b> (<b>WA)</b> and Narrow Angle (NA) cameras can be processed with such processing scheme. Also, Mercury with Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) and optical imagery of Messenger can be the candidate for the application of proposed stereo system. Based on the main components have been accomplished in the developed system, including geodetic control, the scheme of stereo image matching and the feed-forwarded data delivery for model-based matching, the prototype system can be executed with a few additional modules for accommodating specific characteristics of applied data.|$|E
40|$|Waveguide {{discontinuities}} {{are frequently}} encountered in modern photonic structures. It {{is important to}} characterize the reflection and transmission that occurs at the discontinuous during the design and analysis process of these structures. Significant effort has been focused upon the development of accurate modelling tools, {{and a variety of}} modelling techniques have been applied to solve this kind of problem. Throughout this work, a Transmission matrix based Bidirectional Beam Propagation Method (T-Bi-BPM) is proposed and applied on the uncoated facet and the single coating layer reflection problems, including both normal and angled incident situations. The T-Bi-BPM method is developed on the basis of an overview of Finite Difference Beam Propagation Method (FD-BPM) schemes frequently used in photonic modelling including paraxial FD-BPM, Imaginary Distance (ID) BPM, <b>Wide</b> <b>Angle</b> (<b>WA)</b> BPM and existing Bidirectional (Bi) BPM methods. The T-Bi-BPM establishes the connection between the total fields {{on either side of the}} coating layer and the incident field at the input of a single layer coated structure by a matrix system on the basis of a transmission matrix equation used in a transmission line approach. The matrix system can be algebraically preconditioned and then solved by sparse matrix multiplications. The attraction of the T-Bi-BPM method is the potential for more rapid evaluation without iterative approach. The accuracy of the T-Bi-BPM is verified by simulations and the factors that affect the accuracy are investigated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceImproving seismic imaging of {{the crust}} is {{essential}} for understanding the structural factors controlling subduction zones processes. We developed a processing work flow based on the combined analysis of multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) and <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> (<b>WA)</b> reflection/refraction data to derive both shallow and deep velocities suitable for prestack depth migration and to construct a blocky velocity model integrating all identifiable seismic phases contained in MCS and WA data. We apply this strategy {{to the study of}} the north Ecuador–SW Colombia subduction margin to improve the imaging and geostructural interpretation of a splay fault and surrounding outer and inner margin wedges. Results show improvements over tomographic inversion of WA data only, such as (1) sediment velocity variation across the trench and margin slope that correlates with lateral lithologic changes, tectonic compaction and effect of mass wasting processes; (2) a two-layer velocity structure of the inner wedge basement that is consistent with the crust of an oceanic plateau; (3) a complex velocity structure of the outer wedge basement that consists of a deep, high-velocity (5. 0 – 5. 5 km s− 1) core and a low-velocity zone (3. 8 – 5. 0 km s− 1) associated with the major splay fault; (4) a ∼ 1. 3 -km-thick, low-velocity (3. 5 – 4. 0 km s− 1) subduction channel that extends beneath the margin outer wedge. Both the splay fault and subduction channel are expected to direct fluid flows; and (5) downdip velocity increase (5 – 6 km s− 1) in the subducting oceanic crust associated with a low (7. 8 km s− 1) upper mantle velocity, possibly reflecting changes in rock nature or properties...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{relation}} between the proximal or distal localisation ofatherosclerotic lesions and 3 anatomical variables (i) {{the length of the}} left main coronary artery, (ii) its angle of bifurcation into anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and (iii) the dominant coronary artery, was sought at coronary angiography. Studies were made on 149 angiograms of which 95 had critical stenoses (> 50 % of vessel lumen) and the remaining 54 were either normal or contained only minimal disease. The mean left main coronary artery length was shorter in the patients with coronary artery disease (10. 6 mm) than in the normals (12. 9 mm). Patients with proximal coronary artery disease (9. 1 mm) had a much shorter mean left main coronary artery length than those with distal lesions alone (12. 9 mm). This finding implies that a short left main coronary artery favours the proximal localisation of athero-sclerotic stenoses by increasing the severity of atherogenesis proximally. No significant difference was found between the mean angle of bifurcation of the normals (750) and that of the total coronary artery disease group (810). The patients with proximal disease showed a tendency towards a <b>wider</b> bifurcation <b>angle</b> (850) than the distal disease group (760) but this did not reach significance at the 5 per cent level. When present in combination with a short left main coronary artery, a <b>wide</b> bifurcation <b>angle</b> <b>wa...</b>|$|R

Each camera is characterized by small physical size and mass (; 6 3 6 3 12 cm, including baffle;, 500 g), low power requirements (, 2. 5 W, including power supply losses), and high science performance (1000 3 1000 pixel, low noise). The <b>Wide</b> <b>Angle</b> (<b>WA)</b> camera will {{have the capability to}} map Mars in five visible and two ultraviolet spectral bands at a resolution of better than 8 km/pixel under the worst case downlink data rate. Under better downlink conditions the WA will provide kilometer-scale global maps of atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, hazes, dust storms, and the polar hood. Limb observations will provide additional detail on atmospheric structure at 1 / 3 scale-height resolution. The Medium Angle (MA) camera is designed to study selected areas of Mars at regional scale. From 400 km altitude its 68 FOV, which covers; 40 km at 40 m/pixel, will permit all locations on the planet except the poles to be accessible for image acquisitions every two mapping cycles (roughly 52 sols). Eight spectral channels between 425 and 1000 nm provide the ability to discriminate both atmospheric and surface features on the basis of composition. The primary science objectives of MARCI are to (1) observe Martian atmospheric processes at synoptic scales and mesoscales, (2) study details of the interaction of the atmosphere with the surface at a variety of scales in both space and time, and (3) examine surface features characteristic of the evolution of the Martian climate over time. MARCI will directly address two of the three high-level goals of the Mars Surveyor Program: Climate and Resources. Life, the third goal, will be addressed indirectly through the environmental factors associated with the other two goals...|$|E
