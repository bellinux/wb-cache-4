The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's Q clearance being revoked. This {{marked the end of}} his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of anti-Communist McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of his grief.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

The movements are unified by a motto marked as trumpetta, although it is unclear whether this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> marking or an actual indication for performance on a trumpet. Unification of a mass by cantus firmus writing was not to occur for another decade at least, most likely in England: Grossin was one of the first, after Johannes Ciconia, to sense the need for musical unity in the several movements and accomplish it by use of a type of motto theme.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and civilian leaders. The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Ryūzōji clan {{was older}} than the Nabeshima clan in Hizen. After Ryūzōji Takanobu's death, his {{assistant}} Nabeshima Naoshige held the real power, and after {{the sudden death of}} Takanobu's grandchild Takafusa, his father Masaie also committed suicide. Afterwards, since the remnants of the Ryūzōji clan created disturbances in the public order near the Saga castle, Naoshige, in order to pacify the spirits of the Ryūzōji, built Tenyū-ji (now in Tafuse, Saga). This has been considered the origin of the disturbance and it is thought that the bakeneko <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of the Ryūzōji's grudge {{in the form of a}} cat. Also, the inheritance of power from the Ryūzōji clan to the Nabeshima clan was not an issue, but because of Takanobu's death, and Nabeshima Katsushige's son's sudden death, some point out that this kaidan (ghost story) arose from a dramatization of this series of events.|$|E

25|$|Tibet {{was clearly}} {{subordinate}} to the Qing {{by the end of}} the 18th century. But with the arrival of the 19th century, especially with the weakening of the Qing dynasty itself in the later half of the 19th century, Qing authority over Tibet gradually weakened to the point of being minuscule, or merely symbolic. Chinese historians argue that the ambans presence <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of Chinese sovereignty, while those favouring Tibetan independence claims tend to equate the ambans with ambassadors. The relationship between Tibet and (Qing) China was that of patron and priest and was not based on the subordination of one to the other, according to the 13th Dalai Lama. (The 13th Dalai Lama was deposed in 1904, reinstated in 1908 and deposed again in 1910 by the Qing government, but these pronouncements were not taken seriously in Lhasa.) However, in the 1860s the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the Qing Empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.|$|E
25|$|The violent {{uprising}} of John Chilembwe in 1915 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of {{the frustration}} of educated Africans denied an effective political voice and of the grievances of ordinary Africans denied {{a share in the}} benefits of the colonial economy as well as of religious radicalism. After the Chilembwe rising, protests against colonial rule were muted and concentrated on economic and social improvement for Africans, with political representation as a distant aspiration. However, a 1930 declaration by the British government that white settlers north of the Zambezi could not form minority governments to dominate local Africans stimulated political awareness. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the most pressing problem was African access to land. Between 1892 and 1894, about 15% of the total land area of the Nyasaland, including some 867,000 acres, or over 350,000 hectares of the best land in the Shire Highlands the most densely populated part of the country, had been turned into European owned estates. Africans who were resident on these estates were required to pay rent, normally satisfied by their undertaking agricultural work for the owner under the system known as thangata, which later developed into a form of sharecropping in some areas.|$|E

[...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C.

[...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression.

Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E
