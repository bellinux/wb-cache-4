500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Disposition of Error, a fifth-century tract {{defending}} Buddhism, {{a religion}} that had originated in India, notes that when Confucius was threatening to take residence among the nine barbarian nations (九黎) he said, [...] "If a gentleman-scholar dwells in their midst, what baseness can there be among them?" [...] An alternate translation of the philosopher's Analect 9.14 is, [...] "Someone said: 'They are vulgar. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> about them?' The Master said: 'A gentleman used to live there. How could they be vulgar?'" [...] In both translations, the author is shown {{to believe in the}} superiority of the Hua culture over that of the Yi.|$|E
2500|$|De La Hoya took {{a beating}} and his corner stopped the fight after the eighth round. Pacquiao was ahead {{on all three}} judges' {{scorecards}} before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight 80–71 and the other judge scoring it at 79–72. After the bout, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach stated, [...] "We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot." [...] Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he'd grown too old, De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach, [...] "You're right, Freddie. I don't have it anymore." [...] When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting, De La Hoya responded, [...] "My heart still wants to fight, that's for sure," [...] De La Hoya said. [...] "But when your physical doesn't respond, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> I have to be smart and make sure I think about my future plans." [...] During the first episode of the HBO 24/7 Pacquiao–Hatton series, Roach had said he saw IV marks on De La Hoya's arm, pointing out {{that he needed to}} be rehydrated surgically as a last resort.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?" [...] An official army spokesman's statement questioned the accuracy of Kol Ha'ir report.|$|E
