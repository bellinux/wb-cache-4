25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} game <b>We</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much like a typical board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer card driven games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games. Twilight Struggle, a game based on the Cold War, was ranked #1 on the website BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016. As of April 2017, it's ranked third.|$|E
