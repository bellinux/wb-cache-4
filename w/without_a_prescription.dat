5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>prescription.</b> Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.).

5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>prescription.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{emergence}} of microbial resistance is widely associated with inappropriate antibiotic use. Self-medication with antibiotics acquired directly from pharmacies <b>without</b> <b>a</b> medical <b>prescription</b> {{has been reported}} by several European countries as being an important cause of such inappropriate use. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify and evaluate community pharmacists׳ attitudes toward and knowledge of antibiotics and microbial resistance and to assess what influence, if any, these attitudes might have on their propensity to dispense unprescribed antibiotics. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study covering all community pharmacists registered with the Official College of Pharmacists in Portugal׳s Central Region. A self-administered questionnaire on attitudes toward microbial resistance and antibiotic use was mailed to 1197 pharmacists. Responses ranged from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). Logistic regression was used to model the association between respondents׳ attitudes and their propensity to dispense antibiotics <b>without</b> <b>an</b> earlier medical <b>prescription.</b> FINDINGS: The overall response rate was 64. 8 %. Agreement with the dispensing of unprescribed antibiotics was highest in the case of dental diseases and ailments, followed by urinary tract infections. Although none of the sociodemographic data were associated with a propensity to dispense antibiotics <b>without</b> <b>a</b> medical <b>prescription,</b> the attitudes shown to be significantly associated with this propensity were complacency about patients, responsibility of others, and precaution or fear. IMPLICATIONS: Because the attitudes of community pharmacists can influence their readiness to dispense unprescribed antibiotics, educational interventions addressing such attitudes should be implemented to improve antibiotic use...|$|R

2500|$|While most Internet {{pharmacies}} sell {{prescription drugs}} and require <b>a</b> valid <b>prescription,</b> some Internet pharmacies sell <b>prescription</b> drugs <b>without</b> requiring <b>a</b> <b>prescription.</b> [...] Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the [...] "inconvenience" [...] of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{reported}} practice of Australian community pharmacists {{when dealing with}} medication supply requests in absence of <b>a</b> valid <b>prescription.</b> METHODS: Self-administered questionnaire was posted to 1490 randomly selected community pharmacies across all Australian states and territories. This sample {{was estimated to be}} a 20 % of all Australian community pharmacies. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty five pharmacists participated in the study (response rate achieved was 27. 9 % (there were 111 undelivered questionnaires). Respondents indicated that {{they were more likely to}} provide medications to regular customers <b>without</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>prescription</b> compared to non-regular customers (p< 0. 0001). However, supply was also influenced by the type of prescription and the medication requested. In the case of type of prescription (Standard, Authority or Private) this relates to the complexity/probability of obtaining <b>a</b> valid <b>prescription</b> from the prescriber at a later date (i. e. supply with <b>an</b> anticipated <b>prescription).</b> Decisions to supply and/or not supply related to medication type were more complex. For some cases, including medication with potential for abuse, the practice and/or the method of supply varied significantly according to age and gender of the pharmacist, and pharmacy location (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Although being a regular customer does not guarantee a supply, results of this study reinforce the importance for patients having a regular pharmacy, where pharmacists were more likely to continue medication supply in cases of patients presenting <b>without</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>prescription.</b> We would suggest, more flexible legislation should be implemented to allow pharmacists to continue supplying of medication when obtaining <b>a</b> <b>prescription</b> is not practical...|$|R
