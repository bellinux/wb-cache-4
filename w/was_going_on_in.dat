5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to know what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

25|$|Griffith's {{early career}} {{was as a}} monologist, {{delivering}} long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told {{from the point of}} view of a naïve country preacher trying to figure out what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.|$|E
25|$|The {{first serious}} armed {{conflict}} {{of the war}} took place around 14 February – 16 February, near the towns of Manevychi and Biaroza in Belarus.

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Aman Ullah Khan (1919–29), the Iranian {{minister}} in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a “who’s who” of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout Shia Muslim, highly regarded by the Qizilbash community of Kabul, {{as well as a}} leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the capital.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about what else <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{deferred}} maintenance, {{the condition}} of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s; new construction was, by then, considered ludicrous. Even as the only new construction <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the 63rd Street Line, Manhattan residents at the vicinity of York Avenue and East 63rd Street protested over the MTA's intention to build a ventilation shaft for the line. During the early 1980s, work on the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines continued, although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October 1980, and spending the money instead on maintaining the existing system.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware of what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz {{was one of the}} first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first serious}} armed {{conflict}} {{of the war}} took place on February 14. While Soviet units retreated without a fight {{from the town of}} Mosty, fighting erupted near the towns of Maniewicze and Bereza Kartuska in Belarus. By late February the Bolshevik offensive had come to a halt, and it had become apparent that the Red Army would not break through the Polish lines with half-hearted attacks. On 27 February 1919 the Soviets proclaimed the creation of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been engaged with the Ukrainian forces (Polish–Ukrainian War). Active fighting <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the territories of Baltic countries (Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Latvian War of Independence and Estonian War of Independence). Further escalation of the conflict seemed inevitable.|$|E
25|$|The {{knowledgeable}} Vicar Kersten (died 25 Oct. 1967), becoming {{after the}} war {{one of the first}} woman pastors in Berlin, was an important proponent of the Confessing Christians in the Capernaum Congregation. She led the Sunday school of the official Capernaum Congregation and regularly attracted 250 children and juveniles of parents of all allegiances. In the scope of the Confessing Church she held weekly Bible hours in her private apartment in Müllerstraße #97c, until she was bombed out in an allied air raid in February 1945. At the end of these meetings she traded the latest news about murders, arrests, and what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> concentration camps, which were concealed by the official Nazi media. Kersten informed about a senior police officer in the local Seestraße precinct, who issued official police documents confirming the Christianness of its bearer, as Mechur recalled in 1989.|$|E

25|$|On 6 August 2008, {{the heavy}} ground {{fighting}} {{erupted in the}} Loisam area of the Bajaur district. The Loisam lies on the strategically important road leading towards the main northwestern city of Peshawar. The fighting started when hundreds of foreign fighters poured into the area and began attacking armed forces. After four days of fighting on 10 August 2008, the military was forced {{to withdraw from the}} area. It resulted in confirmed killing of 100 militants and 9 soldiers, and another 55soldiers were missing, at least three dozen of them captured by the militants. While the fighting <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Bajaur, in the Buner area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the militants killed at least nine policemen in an attack on a check post. The checkpoint was then abandoned, and the army troops withdrew to Khar, the main town of Bajaur Agency. There were reports that the town of Khar was then besieged by tribal militants.|$|E
25|$|Preparation for {{development}} of the next Persona title began in 2010. Rumors of its development were floating around since 2009, when Sony's mobile website listed Katsura Hashino as the game's director. According to another source, preparatory work <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> 2008 while Persona 4 was still in development. Preparatory development was nearing completion in August 2011, with full development beginning after that following the completion of Catherine. Hashino was only fully involved in development after Catherine was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next Persona title's development. Development lasted five years. When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modelling work for the Trauma Team series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.|$|E

[...] "It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> El Paso and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me," [...] Dahl later said.
