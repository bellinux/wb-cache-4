First, a model is introduced {{that describes the}} continuous plant and discrete event controller along with an interface which connects them. A Discrete Event System (DES) automaton description is employed to describe the plant together with the interface and {{it is used to}} analyze the hybrid control system. Controllability is defined for hybrid control systems, enhancing existing DES control concepts. It is then used to obtain a controller design method for hybrid control systems. 1 Introduction Hybrid systems contain two distinct types of systems, system with continuous dynamics and systems with discrete event dynamics, that interact with each other. Hybrid control systems typically arise when continuous processes interact with, or are supervised by, sequential machines.

40|$|Abstract Background From many {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} points of view, {{the implementation of}} shared decision making (SDM) in work rehabilitation for pain due to a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is justified but typically the SDM model applies to a one on one encounter between a healthcare provider and a patient and not to an interdisciplinary team. Objectives To adapt and implement an SDM program adapted {{to the realities of}} work rehabilitation for pain associated with a MSD. More specific objectives are to adapt an SDM program applicable to existing rehabilitation programs, and to evaluate the extent of implementation of the SDM program in four rehabilitation centres. Method For objective one, we will use a mixed perspective combining a theory-based development program/intervention and a user-based perspective. The users are the occupational therapists (OTs) and clinical coordinators. The strategies for developing an SDM program will include consulting the scientific literature and group consensus with clinicians-experts. A sample of convenience of eight OTs, four clinical coordinators and four psychologists all of whom have been working full-time in MSD rehabilitation {{for more than two years}} will be recruited from four collaborating rehabilitation centres. For objective two, using the same criteria as for objective one, we will first train eight OTs in SDM. Second, using a descriptive design, the extent to which the SDM program has been implemented will be assessed through observations of the SDM process. The observation data will be triangulated with the dyadic working alliance questionnaire, and findings from a final individual interview <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>OT.</b> A total of five patients per trained OT will be recruited, for a total of 40 patients. Patients will be eligible if they have a work-related disability for more than 12 weeks due to musculoskeletal pain and plan to start their work rehabilitation programs. Discussion This study will be the first evaluation of the program and it is expected that improvements will be made prior to a broader-scale implementation. The ultimate aim is to improve the quality of decision making, patients' quality of life, and reduce the duration of their work-related disability by improving the services offered during the rehabilitation process. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{study for}} a service port in Beira Harbour {{can be divided}} into three {{different}} parts. These parts will be discussed below in the sequence in which they have been carried out. The first part consists of the preparations for the journey to Beira and the actual site investigation. In Beira a site investigation had been carried out to obtain all the necessary data and infonnation to make it possible to design the service port. In the Netherlands a study for this purpose started at the head-office of DHV Consultants. For this purpose use has been madeof the existing studies for Beira Harbour. This study was not sufficient and the information that was lacking had to be obtained during the visit to Beira. In Beira {{there were a lot of}} meetings with the different authorities to get the data and an impression of the problems in Beira Harbour. A selection of the most suitable location for the new service port was also carried out in Beira. The conclusion of this selection is that Praia Novais the best location for this purpose. There were no maps of this terrain at the time and a survey had to be done to make it possible to makethe maps. After returning to the Netherlands with all the obtained data and information acquired in Beira to design the service port, it was necessary to collect all the information clearly in a separate report. This is Volume 1, Site Investigation. The different alternatives could then be identified and compared <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>ot</b> her to estimate which one is the best. The first conclusion was that alternative 2 was the best one. This alternative provides a service port in the northern part of the terrain in combination with the use of the existing fishery port. The disadvantage of this alternative is the rate of siltation. This siltation rate is not acceptable because the maintenance casts would be enormous. For this reason al ternative 2 has been improved in the final design. This has been done by situating the moorings along the river bank. These subjects are discussed in this MainReport. The third part of the study is the construction of a floating breakwater. This floating breakwater is the mooring for the small passenger vessels. It has to provide a sheltered mooring. The breakwater is a construction madeout of concrete which would slide up and downwith the tide along piles driven into the river bottom. The piles would keep the in its correct position and absorb the pressures. The results of the design for this floating breakwater are listed in Volume 2. Generally one can say that there is a real demand for a newservice port in Beira in order to solve the problems in the existing fishery port. The difficulty is to design a port with as little siltation as possible and sufficient sheltering. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|An {{occupational}} {{preventive medicine}} program {{attempts to control}} exposure so workers experience no detrimental effect on health. In a chemically complex industry, the definition of exposure is difficult because of the many different chemicals used and produced, the many different jobs and processes with qualitatively different exposures, {{and the movement of}} workers from job to job. Jobs have therefore been grouped on the basis of process or product into functionally homogeneous categories called occupational titles (OT's). Work experience can now be quantified independent of exposure (or by the dominant toxicants in <b>each</b> <b>OT)</b> and compared to health outcomes. Examples are discussed of the application of OT's to studies of the mortality and morbidity experience in the rubber industry, and the development of dose-response relations...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for oxytocin (OT) administration on Day 13 postovulation {{was developed in}} mares for stimulation of a pulse of PGFM (a PGF 2 α metabolite) that mimics a natural PGFM pulse during luteolysis. Bolus treatment <b>with</b> <b>each</b> of five <b>OT</b> doses (1 – 10 IU/mare, n = 3) stimulated a burst of PGFM that was maximum in 4 minutes and was unlike a natural pulse. A 2 -hour OT infusion of 1. 25, 2. 5, or 5 IU/ 100 kg (n = 4) induced a PGFM pulse similar to reported pulses; lower doses did not. The peak of an induced pulse (approximately 260 – 380 pg/mL) seemed similar to reported natural peaks (approximately 200 – 300 pg/mL), using the same assay system. The interval from nadir to nadir was 6. 6 ± 0. 2 hours. Percentage decrease in progesterone (P 4) within 8 hours was greater (P < 0. 05) for doses of 1. 25, 2. 5, or 5 IU/ 100 kg (43 %– 50 %) than that for a vehicle group (11 %). Treatment with flunixin meglumine (1. 0 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, decreased (P < 0. 008) P 4 concentration, but treatment 2 hours {{before the beginning of}} OT infusion (2. 5 IU/ 100 kg) did not prevent the OT-induced PGFM pulses and the decrease in P 4. In conclusion, a PGFM pulse was simulated by infusion of OT during 2 hours but not by a single OT bolus, and an OT-simulated PGFM pulse stimulated a decrease in P 4 that was not prevented by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These are the first firm demonstrations that OT in mares as in other species has a role in luteolysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Radio frequency~identification (RFIDW is a {{technology}} where a reader device can "sense " {{the presence of}} a closeby object by reading a tag device attached to the object. To improve coverage, multiple RFID readers can be deployed in the given region. In this paper, we consider the problem of slotted scheduled access of RFID tags in a multiple reader environment. In particular, we develop centralized algorithms in a slotted time model to read all the tags using near-optimal number ot time slots. We consider two scenarios- one wherein the tag distribution in the physical space is unknown, and the other where tag distribution is known or can be estimated a priori. For <b>each</b> <b>ot</b> these scenarios, we consider two cases depending on whether a single channel or multiple channels are available. All the above version of the problem are NP-hard. We design approximation algorithms for the single channel and heuristic algorithms for the multiple channel cases. Through extensive simulations, we show that for the single channel case, our heuristics perform close to the approximation algorithms. In general, our simulations show that our algorithms significantly outperform Colorwave, an existing algorithm for similar problems. I...|$|R

This paper considers the potential for co-management of sea turtle fisheries within four UK Overseas Territories (OTs) in the Caribbean, and for co-ordinated management among those territories. We focus on fisher incentives for engaging in co-management and on the potential to scale up co-management to a regional level. This paper presents data from Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands, where 110 turtle fishers participated in a socio-economic survey undertaken {{as part of the}} 'Turtles in the UK Overseas Territories in the Caribbean' project. Based on three established criteria for co-management (perceived crisis in stock, willingness to participate and community cohesion), results suggest that fisher support for co-management exists within <b>each</b> <b>OT,</b> but the extent of support for and views of specific management interventions varies among OTs. The implications of results for co-management in each territory, and for establishing co-ordinated management regimes in the region, are discussed in the context of current debates about the nature of resources and scalar (mis) matches between resource and management regimes.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the “Pi of the Sky” system is to {{investigate}} short timescale astrophysical phenomena (particularly gamma-ray bursts, optical transients and variable stars). Wide field, short exposures and full automation of the system, together with effective algorithms, give good prospects for effective identification of space debris elements.

40|$|Oblivious {{transfer}} (OT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental primitives in cryptography and is widely used in protocols for secure two-party and multi-party computation. As secure com-putation becomes more practical, the need for practical large scale oblivious transfer protocols is becoming more evident. Oblivious transfer extensions are protocols that enable a relatively small number of “base-OTs ” to be utilized to compute a very large number of OTs at low cost. In the semi-honest setting, Ishai et al. (CRYPTO 2003) presented an OT extension protocol for which the cost of <b>each</b> <b>OT</b> (beyond the base-OTs) is just a few hash function operations.

40|$|International audienceIn {{terms of}} scalability, cost {{and ease of}} deployment, the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{approach}} {{has emerged as a}} promising solution for video streaming applications. Its architecture enables end-hosts, called peers, to relay the video stream to <b>each</b> <b>ot</b> her. P 2 P systems are in fact networks of users who control peers. Thus, user behavior is crucial to the performance of these systems because it directly impacts the streaming flow. To understand user behavior, several measurement studies have been carried out over different video streaming systems. Each measurement analyzes a particular system focusing on specific metrics and presents insights. However, a single study based on a particular system and specific metrics is not sufficient to provide a complete model of user behavior considering all of its components and the impact of external factors on them. In this paper, we propose a comparison and a synthesis of these measurements. First of all, we review video streaming architectures, followed by a survey on the user behavior measurements in these architectures. Then, we gather insights revealed in these measurements and compare them for consensual and contrasting points. Finally, we extract components of user behavior, their external impacting factors and relationships among them.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a critique of}} optimality-theoretic syntax. First, it questions the frequently encountered claim that an OT approach to a particular problem is ‘restrictive’, {{in the sense that}} it limits the class of possible languages. Such claims, it will be argued, are in principle difficult if not impossible to substantiate. Since constraints are, by hypothesis, universal, there will almost surely be some additional constraint whose interaction with the constraints of the proposed analysis would yield the undesired grammars. Secondly, the paper criticizes the attempt to provide substance to the idea that constraints are universal by requiring for each a functional motivation. While identifying a function for <b>each</b> <b>OT</b> constraint is trivially accomplishable, it is an undesirable ‘accomplishment’. Functions and functionally-motivated hierarchies are neither part of grammar nor linked directly to grammatical constructs. Rather, their effect is manifest at the level of language use and language acquisition and (therefore) language change. Finally, OT falters in its treatment of optionality, whether discourse-independent or discourse-dependent. In both cases, it needs to posit otherwise unneeded competition sets and in the latter case it requires the blurring of the distinction between purely syntactic generalizations and those relating syntactic structure to information structure.

We started from the principle that in <b>each</b> <b>OT</b> case-study {{it is important to}} identify the patient’s previously life roles held and the activities that were fulfilled within these roles. As methodological tool, we applied the Person-Environment-Occupation Model (PEO) in a 48 years old woman, with reactive depression (after her husband’s death) and congenital hypoacusis. After identifying the occupational routine and life style of the client, we established as a valid aim of OT intervention the client’s return to an old hobby, the flowers photography, and we described the PEO factors that influence flower shooting performance. From a global perspective, client’s occupational performance was considered as satisfactory. Her abilities and independent functional status allow her to be engaged in different daily occupations that match with her environment. After completing the PEO transaction for flower shooting, we extracted the occupational needs of the client. This client centered case study is an example of good practice, which reveals the possibility of achieving a higher level of occupational performance and to increase self-esteem for individuals with depression...|$|R
40|$|An {{oblivious}} transfer (OT) protocol allows a receiver to obtain {{one of two}} bits held by a sender without revealing its selection. An OT combiner securely implements OT by using oracle access to n OT candidates of which at most t may be insecure. It is known that OT combiners exist when t < n/ 2. However, known constructions either invoke each candidate multiple times or alternatively require t {{to be a very}} small fraction of n, even in the semi-honest security model. In this work we study the goal of maximizing the security level of single-use OT combiners in the semi-honest model, namely OT combiners in which each candidate can only be invoked once.

Methods Data related to continuing education requirements from <b>each</b> <b>OT</b> regulatory board of all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States were reviewed and categorized by two reviewers. Analysis was conducted based on the categorization of the continuing education requirements and activities required, allowed, and not allowed/not mentioned for continuing education units. Results Findings revealed non-uniformity and inconsistency of continuing education requirements for licensure renewal between OT regulatory boards and was coupled with lack of specific criteria for various continuing education activities. Continuing education requirements were not tailored to meet the needs of individual licensee’s current and anticipated professional role and job responsibilities, with a negative bias towards presentation and publication allowed for continuing education units. Few boards mandated continuing education topics on ethics related to <b>OT</b> practice within <b>each</b> renewal cycle.
