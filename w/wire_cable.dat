In each boat two crewmen wearing strong gloves, one each in the bow and the stern, would slide their hands along the cable to guide boats from ship to shore.

The gymnasts must perform a routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging.

25|$|While earlier {{bridges of}} this type use chain eyebars, the long span needed here uses <b>wire</b> <b>cable,</b> like other modern {{suspension}} bridges. Uniquely, this is a single loop of cable rather than the usual pair of cables, and, rather than being spun in place above the catwalks, substantial bundles of strands were dragged into place with temporary support above the catwalks, eventually suspended by tensioning the strand. These strand bundles were then arranged to be finally compacted to form the completed main cable.|$|E

The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E

Along {{with the}} people {{environmental}} protection consciousness enhancement, the enterprise and the family are inclined to use the green electric <b>wire</b> and <b>cable</b> to reduce the environmental pollution. This paper firstly introduces the concept of green electric <b>wire</b> and <b>cable,</b> and then expounds thecurrent situation of green electric <b>wire</b> and <b>cable</b> materials, finally gives the development tendency of green electric <b>wire</b> and <b>cable</b> materialsin order to provide references for the related researchers.

2500|$|Development of wire-cable {{suspension}} bridges {{dates to}} the temporary simple suspension bridge at Annonay built by Marc Seguin and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m. The first permanent <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> suspension bridge was Guillaume Henri Dufour's Saint Antoine Bridge in Geneva of 1823, with two 40 m spans. [...] The first with cables assembled in mid-air in the modern method was Joseph Chaley's Grand Pont Suspendu in Fribourg, in 1834.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} built in 1889 by George Grant Mackay, a Scottish civil engineer and park commissioner for Vancouver. It was originally made of hemp ropes with {{a deck of}} cedar planks, and was replaced with a <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> bridge in 1903. In 1910 Edward Mahon purchased the Capilano Suspension Bridge. [...] "Mac" [...] MacEachran purchased the Bridge from Mahon in 1935 and invited local natives to place their totem poles in the park, adding a native theme. In 1945, he sold the bridge to Henri Aubeneau.|$|E

A guerrilla learns how to derail and wreck trains, blow up tanks, destroy planes on the ground, dynamite bridges. In taking sentries, advises Mr. Levy, the back is the best approach. If that is not possible, the guerrilla covers the sentry with his revolver, steps on his foot, unbuttons his tunic and jerks it down over his arms to lock them. [...] "You may slap his ears with the revolver barrel, to intimidate him[...] [...] [...] You should also drop his trousers to lock his feet."

50|$|A {{cable reel}} is a round, drum-shaped object {{such as a}} spool used to carry various types of {{electrical}} <b>wires.</b> <b>Cable</b> reel which can also be termed as drums {{have been used for}} many years to transport electric cables, fiber optic <b>cables</b> and <b>wire</b> products. <b>Cable</b> reels usually come in four different types, each with their own uses: wood, plywood, plastic and steel.|$|R

[...] Inaudible, but convincing, the great inventor expounded his discovery, and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients, round curves, and across a sagging wire. It ran along its single rail, on its single wheels, simple and sufficient; it stopped, reversed stood still, balancing perfectly. It maintained its astounding equilibrium amidst a thunder of applause. The audience dispersed at last, discussing how far they would enjoy crossing an abyss on a <b>wire</b> <b>cable.</b> [...] "Suppose the gyroscope stopped!"

Rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood (to imitate stone), each house just big enough for a man and his family. Let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us, their ancestors.|$|E
