25|$|Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan, has {{attended}} a ball, but he leaves early and encounters his assembled courtiers. He is bored with everyone; {{all seem to}} be paying obeisance to his wife because they regard her as the more powerful, his title and power having come only from his marriage to her: “Such torment and such martyrdom I cannot bear much longer”. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize but <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> does not break free given his position as Duke. Also, they warn {{him that if he}} does not act, Beatrice's servants may well begin plotting against him.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the title}} sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry {{at the prison}} gates {{following}} his release. He drives a white Ford Capri, although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car {{as part of their}} ensuing working deal, {{in the same manner as}} the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> <b>He</b> is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself - and Arthur or those around him - in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.|$|E
500|$|Clough {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I'm not {{equipped}} to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back." [...] The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would knock you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick you up and put you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us." [...] On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences.|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E

500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Australian innings the {{temperature}} dropped and a breeze came up which helped the Australian bowlers Alan Davidson and Ray Lindwall with their swing. Peter Richardson and Trevor Bailey were soon out and at 11/2 Peter May (37), promoted to number 3 to protect the other batsmen, and Colin Cowdrey (84) were back at the crease. They attacked the bowling with finely tuned strokes and with Graveney (41) took England to 170/3, May was bowled by Richie Benaud (5/91) when he tried to hit him for six. On the fourth day England collapsed to 188/9, Gordon Rorke (3/23) starting the rot by bowling Cowdrey, who edged the ball onto his stumps, and having Graveney caught by Benaud despite the ball coming off the bat at high speed. Tom Graveney recalled [...] "I had a personal experience of Richie's tactical genius...he held up play while he moved the short leg round a couple of yards. It interrupted my flow because I was forced to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had done it and whether I should be expecting a new direction from the bowler. This was exactly the reaction that Richie had wanted. There was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsman and reach their subconscious" [...] Benaud then dismissed Trueman, Lock, Tyson and Evans, two caught by Wally Grout, one by Burke and the other by the bowler himself. England were 89 runs short of saving the follow on, but Willie Watson and Brian Statham stayed at the crease for 70 minutes. Statham, who batted left-handed, hit 6 fours in a new highest Test score of 36 not out. Lindwall was given the new ball, but could only shave the stumps as Statham hit out. Davidson tripped in one of Trueman's foot marks and had to retire from the field. In the end Rorke bowled Watson to end the 52 run last wicket stand 37 runs short of their target. Rorke on debut returned figures of 18.1–7–23–3, his low economy due to his large number of almost wides and high pace and in one three over spell only one ball could have been played.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{forefront}} of the bowling attack was Ray Lindwall, who became a fast bowler after watching Harold Larwood in 1932-33. His whose smooth run up and perfect delivery produced swing and control and bouncers at a lethal pace, though he dropped the ball short less than Miller. Neville Cardus later wrote that [...] "He has so many brains it's a <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> ever went in for fast bowling" [...] and working hand-in-glove with his captain Don Bradman he would think batsman out and catch them in carefully selected field-placings. A. P. Herbert was moved to poetry to describe his bowling action and Trevor Bailey wrote [...] "Watching him bowl {{was one of the most}} satisfying spectacles the game has ever produced". Even so, his arm was thought to be too low (Frank Tyson thought him almost a round-arm bowler) and his long drag could have produced numerous no balls, though he was rarely called for this. His partner Keith Miller had been a batsmen, but in the Victory Tests the Australian Services XI were short of bowlers and Hassett used Miller initially as a change bowler and then gave him the new ball. To everyone's surprise he picked up wickets and soon his strength and natural talent made him into a genuine fast bowler. Bradman knew Australia needed this more than another batsman and encouraged Miller to develop his new talent, though his back injury limited him to short spells. Unlike his new-ball partner Miller liked to drop the ball short and lacked consistency, sometimes bowling leg-breaks or off-spin. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone". Together they formed the best fast bowling duo in post-war cricket, perhaps the greatest of any era, and were the spearhead of Australia's success. Ernie Toshack was a left-arm medium pace bowler who bowled with a packed leg-side field and tied up the batsmen when Lindwall and Miller were resting. In the First Test he had the perfect pace to unhinge the English batting on a Brisbane sticky, but failed to understand Bradman's instructions. In the end Bradman took him to the middle, pointed to the spot where he wanted Toshack to bowl, and made him practice alongside the wicket until he understood what was required. Once this was done 9 of the last 15 wickets fell to his bowling and Australia won by an innings. Fred Freer was a steady fast-medium swing bowler who liked to drop the ball short and replaced Ray Lindwall in the Second Test when the fast bowler had chickenpox.|$|E
